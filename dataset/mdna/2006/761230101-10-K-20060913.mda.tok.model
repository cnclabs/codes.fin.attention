high risk infants who are prescribed home monitors include infants with low birth weight  those who are premature  those who survive serious cardiorespiratory episodes and those born to a family with a history of sids 
a limited number of alternative monitoring technologies are generally available 
the company s primary infant monitor is the smart monitor  a fifth generation microprocessor based design that incorporates many aspects of a physiological recorder into the traditional monitor 
in addition to sounding an alarm to alert the infant s caregiver when the infant stops breathing  the smart monitor documents patient episodes with an internal electronic memory system  enabling physicians to study up to six channels of patient waveforms in order to assess the medical significance of the alarm episodes and determine the need for continued monitoring or possible hospitalization 
the data collected by the smart monitor can be transmitted from the home to a clinical center over phone lines or can be extracted from the smart monitor using a memory transfer device such as a computer

the company has relationships with a variety of key customers 
some of these relationships are based on written supply agreements  while others are not

these agreements generally represent the right to sell to customers  often at stated prices and terms 
however  often this access is shared and the company and its competitors must compete for new business 
most of these relationships are terminable at will or upon short notice periods 
maintaining positive relationships with these customers is a key element of the company s sales and marketing strategy 
failure to maintain customer relationships could adversely affect the company s future results of operations 
the company s us homecare provider customer base which ranges in size from large  publicly held companies with several hundred branch locations to small  owner operated companies with one location continues to undergo consolidation  particularly among companies specializing in homecare products

table of contents the company also has approximately registered us and foreign trademarks compared to as of june  and has additional us and foreign trademark applications pending 
regulatory matters the company s products are subject to regulation by  among other governmental entities  the fda and corresponding foreign agencies 
the fda regulates the introduction  manufacture  advertising  labeling  packaging  marketing and distribution of and recordkeeping for such products in the us the company must comply with statutory requirements and fda regulations and is subject to various fda recordkeeping and reporting requirements and to inspections by the fda 
the testing for and preparation of required applications can be expensive  and subsequent fda review can be lengthy and the results uncertain 
the fda also regulates the clinical testing of medical devices 
moreover  fda clearance or approval  if granted  can include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements can result in fines  civil penalties  suspensions or revocation of clearances or approvals  recalls or product seizures  operating restrictions or criminal penalties 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  fda clearances or approvals for the company s products for which such clearances or approvals have not yet been obtained would adversely affect the marketing of such products in the us and could adversely affect the results of future operations 
the company must obtain fda or foreign regulatory approval or clearance for marketing the company s new devices prior to their release for commercial distribution 
there are two primary means by which the fda permits a medical device to be marketed in the us a manufacturer may seek clearance for the device by filing a k premarket notification with the fda 
to obtain such clearance  the k premarket notification must establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that has been legally marketed under a k notification or was marketed before may  in some situations  a device also may be cleared by a k premarket notification through de novo classification even though there is no predicate device 
the manufacturer may not place the device into commercial distribution in the us until a substantial equivalence determination notice is issued by the fda 
the fda  however  may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or require further information  such as additional test data or clinical data  or require the company to modify its product labeling  before it will make a finding of substantial equivalence 
the process of obtaining fda clearance of a k premarket notification  including testing  preparation of the k premarket notification and subsequent fda review  can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
if a manufacturer cannot establish  to the fda s satisfaction  that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  it will have to seek approval to market the device through the premarket approval application pma process 
this process involves preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the process of completing clinical trials  submitting a pma and obtaining fda clearance takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will approve a pma 
the company s export activities and clinical investigations also are subject to the fda s jurisdiction and enforcement 
foreign regulatory approvals vary widely depending on the country 
the company s business in japan is subject to government regulation generally similar to that in the us the japanese ministry of health requires registration and review of new products prior to granting approval to distribute such products in japan and also requires product recalls and corrective actions when circumstances warrant 
the company has received iso certification for its wallingford  connecticut  galway  ireland  bognor regis  uk  and subic bay  philippines facilities and iso certification for its nantes  france facility 
the company has received both iso and iso certifications for its murrysville  pennsylvania  kennesaw  georgia  bend  oregon  carlsbad  california  cedar grove  new jersey  herrsching  germany  and shenzhen  peoples republic of china  facilities 
iso certification is based on criterion developed by the international organization for standardization  a quality standards organization with headquarters in geneva  switzerland 
the company has also received authorization for the same facilities  under the european union s medical devices directive  to affix the ce mark to the company s products marketed throughout the world 
the primary component of the certification process was an audit of the facilities quality systems conducted by an independent agency authorized to perform conformity assessments under iso guidelines and the medical devices directive 
since receiving their original iso certification  these facilities have undergone periodic update audits by such independent agencies 
pharmaceutical products are controlled in the european community ec primarily through the system of licensing and conditional exemptions from licensing set forth in ec legislation  the medicines act of and in relevant subordinate legislation 
this legislation covers the systems by which licenses to manufacture  market  distribute  sell and supply medicinal products are granted by ministers the licensing authority or  in the new centralized system  by the relevant ec institutions  once they are satisfied about the safety  efficacy and quality of the product 

table of contents third party reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the us is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance programs including health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations 
countries outside of the us also have government and private insurance medical reimbursement programs that vary on a country by country basis  with varying levels of reimbursement and degrees of sophistication 
except for amounts representing an insignificant portion of the company s annual revenues less than  the company does not file claims or bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for its products sold in the united states 
however  the company is still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs  and violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties  including fines 
the company believes that its businesses and operations do not violate these laws 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition could also be negatively affected by adverse changes made in the reimbursement policies for medical products under these insurance programs 
if such changes were to occur  the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement for the resale or rental of the company s products could be reduced 
in recent years  limitations imposed on the levels of reimbursement by both government and private insurance programs have become more prevalent 
reimbursement systems vary in countries outside of the united states 
some countries do not provide reimbursement for certain of the products manufactured by the company 
other countries that allow reimbursement may be subject to various restrictions 
the ability of providers to purchase the company s products in these countries is impacted by the amount of reimbursement available from third party payors 
the company has obtained procedure codes for its homecare products from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly known as the healthcare financing administration 
these procedure codes enhance the ability of medical product distributors and dealers to obtain reimbursement for providing products to patients covered by medicare and other insurance payers 
however  reimbursement levels can be reduced after a procedure code has been established 
the amount of reimbursement that a hospital can obtain under the medicare diagnosis related group drg payment system for utilizing the company s products in treating patients is a primary determinant of the revenue that can be realized by the company as well as medical product distributors and dealers who resell or rent the company s hospital products 
many private insurance programs also utilize the medicare drg system 
the various uses of the company s hospital products to treat patients are provided within the drg system 
the levels of reimbursement under the drg system are also subject to review and change 
in august cms published a final rule to modify the medicare inpatient prospective payment system 
the rule adds or modifies some drg codes which cms hopes will more closely align payments based on severity of the illness 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law on december  the act reduced medical reimbursement for respiratory drugs and home oxygen to homecare providers and placed a freeze on current reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment dme through  including certain of the company s products 
as required by the act  medicare plans to implement competitive bidding of durable medical equipment in of the largest metropolitan statistical areas msa by the end of  and in of the largest msas by the end of although specific dme products and services that will be included in competitive bidding have not yet been determined  it is likely that some of the company s product offerings will be included 
in february the us congress passed the deficit reduction act of act which contained medicare payment reductions for home oxygen equipment  and certain durable medical equipment classified by medicare as capped rental equipment 
in august cms published a proposed regulation to implement the act which could reduce medicare reimbursement in for oxygen equipment and capped rental equipment 
additional reimbursement reductions for home oxygen were proposed in president bush s fiscal year budget proposal  and could also be enacted into law 
both the federal government and state legislatures are considering options for containing growth in the medicaid program 
reimbursement reductions  coverage restrictions  and alternative payment systems implemented by state medicaid policies add to an uncertain reimbursement environment 
these changes in medical reimbursement may have a future adverse impact on the company s results of operations  although the company believes that its product breadth and diversification and manufacturing efficiencies will help to mitigate the potential financial impact of the medical reimbursement reductions 
employees the company currently has approximately  employees  including approximately  hourly employees in the us and  hourly employees in the far east 
none of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the company considers its labor relations to be good and has never suffered a work stoppage as a result of a labor conflict

item a 
risk factors the following factors  among other items  could cause the company s future results to differ from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the risks identified in this section are not all inclusive 
the company operates in a dynamic and competitive environment 
new risk factors affecting the company emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors 
further  it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on the company or the extent to which any individual factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
due to these inherent risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
additionally  the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors speaks only as of the date on which they were made and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
industry risks the company participates in a highly competitive environment 
the markets the company participates in are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on its ability to develop  manufacture and market innovative new products 
the development of innovative new products by competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that the company s products treat could make respironics products noncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  some competitors may have greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than respironics 
the consolidation by the company s competitors could result in greater competition 
increased competition could lead to greater increases in pricing pressure 
if innovative new products cannot be developed  the company may not be able to maintain competitive pricing and market share 
the decline in the availability of  or the increase in cost of raw materials could increase the company s costs of producing its products or limit the company s ability to meet sales demand 
the company generally performs all major assembly work on all of its products 
it manufactures many of the plastic components for its face mask products and uses subcontractors to supply certain other components  including printed circuit boards  motor blower assemblies  and plastics 
the company purchases the component parts for its major products from a number of different suppliers 
where appropriate  the company employs contracts with its suppliers  both domestically and internationally 
the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are available 
the raw materials used in the company s components have historically been readily available 
however  loss of a key supplier or access to certain raw materials could have a material adverse impact on the company 
from time to time  the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate due to global market demands  which could impair the company s ability to procure necessary materials  or could increase the cost of such materials 
inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials may occur from time to time 
in addition  freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
a reduction in the supply or an increase in the cost of those raw materials could impact the company s ability to manufacture its products and could increase the cost of production 
the company is subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation  including regulatory quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes 
failure by the company to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the fda regulates the approval  manufacturing  and sales and marketing of many of the company s products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada  japan  europe  and other countries in which the company conducts business 
as a device manufacturer  the company is required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for 
table of contents compliance with the fda s quality system regulation qsr requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require the company to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
in the european community  the company is required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell its products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns  product recalls or related field actions  product shortages or delays in product manufacturing 
efficacy or safety concerns  an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace  and or manufacturing quality issues with respect to the company s products could lead to product recalls or related field actions  withdrawals  and or declining sales 
from time to time the company is required to conduct product recalls and or field actions associated with certain of its products 
the company is currently conducting certain recalls and is investigating certain customer product complaints 
the company has accrued for the anticipated costs associated with these product matters in its consolidated balance sheets as of june  and there can be no assurance these accruals are adequate to cover the actual costs incurred related to these items 
the pricing  sales and marketing programs and arrangements  and related business practices of the industry are under increasing scrutiny from federal and state regulatory  investigative  prosecutorial and administrative entities 
these entities include the department of justice and its us attorney s offices  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  the fda  the federal trade commission and various state attorneys general offices 
many of the healthcare laws under which certain of these governmental entities operate  including the federal and state anti kickback statutes and statutory and common law false claims laws  have been construed broadly by the courts and permit the government entities to exercise significant discretion 
in the event that any of those governmental entities believes that wrongdoing has occurred  one or more of them could institute civil or criminal proceedings  which  if instituted and resolved unfavorably  could subject the company to substantial fines  penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies  including exclusion from government reimbursement programs 
the company also cannot predict whether any investigations will affect its marketing practices or sales 
any such result could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows  financial condition  or its business 
sales may decline if the company s customers do not receive adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for the company s products and if certain types of healthcare programs are adopted in the company s key markets 
in the united states  healthcare providers that purchase the company s products generally rely on payments from third party payors principally federal medicare and private health insurance plans to cover all or a portion of the cost of the company s products 
in the event that third party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement  the company may experience increased selling price pressure and or weakened demand for its products 
further  third party payors are continuing to carefully review their coverage policies with respect to existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of the company s products 
outside the us  reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country 
in the majority of the international markets in which the company s products are sold  government managed healthcare systems mandate the reimbursement rates and methods for medical devices and procedures 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the us are not obtained  international sales of the company s products may decline 
many foreign markets  including canada  and some european and asian countries  have tightened reimbursement rates 
the ability of the company to continue to sell certain of its products profitably in these markets may diminish if the government managed healthcare systems continue to reduce reimbursement rates 

table of contents a natural or man made disaster could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company has approximately ten manufacturing operations located throughout the world 
however  a significant portion of the company s products are produced at its facility in murrysville  pennsylvania 
in the event that this facility or any other significant facility were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural or man made disaster  the company would be forced to shift production to its other facilities and or rely on third party manufacturers 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also operates a substantial amount of its business transactions on an integrated enterprise resource planning system 
failure by the company to protect its systems from a cyber attack or other security breach could have a material adverse impact on the company 
company risks the company s future profitability depends on the success of the company s principal product lines 
sales of the company s sleep apnea products accounted for approximately of the company s net sales for the year ended june  the company expects sales of sleep apnea products to continue to account for a significant portion of the company s aggregate sales 
any event adversely affecting the sale of sleep apnea products may  as a result  adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the success of the company depends on its ability to effectively market to home healthcare providers and sleep laboratories 
the company markets certain products primarily to homecare providers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders 
the role of homecare providers and sleep laboratories is significant in the determination of the brand of product a patient will use 
the company s success depends on its ability to effectively market its products to homecare providers and sleep laboratories 
the company markets to approximately  us sleep laboratories and approximately  homecare providers  most of which use  sell or recommend multiple brands of products 
declining governmental and third party reimbursement amounts have caused pricing pressure on homecare providers 
due to this  homecare providers may require price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased 
the company cannot assure that sleep physicians will continue to prescribe respironics products  or that homecare providers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying the company s products has been written 
marketing activities targeted toward the population with a predisposition to sleep disordered breathing  as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists are ongoing 
the company cannot assure that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness of osa or sales of company products 
the inability to support continued growth could negatively impact the company 
the company has experienced substantial growth 
the effective management of growth depends upon  among other things  the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems  information technology  quality and regulatory compliance systems  and financial and management reporting systems

during fiscal year  sales of the company s products in foreign markets approximated  or of the company s total revenues 
accordingly  the us dollar value of the company s foreign generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional  or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency exchange restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
the local country currency of the company s subsidiaries outside the us is the predominant currency used by the subsidiaries to transact business 
through its international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 

table of contents the company is subject to certain risks inherent in managing a global and decentralized organization 
the company has significant international operations and operates under a decentralized operational structure 
certain risks are inherent in operating and selling products in a global and decentralized organization  including difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the us  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the us  and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements  the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  general economic and political conditions in countries where the company operates or where end users of the company s products reside  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and  other difficulties associated with managing a decentralized organization 
the inability to effectively market the company s products outside the us could adversely impact profitability 
approximately of the company s revenues are generated outside the us  in approximately different countries 
many of these countries have unique regulatory  medical  and business environments 
the inability to effectively market the company s products outside the us could have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s acquisition and strategic investment activity may not be successful 
as a part of the company s growth strategy  the company seeks to make strategic investments and acquisitions of companies  products  and technologies to expand its presence in the sleep and respiratory markets 
the company may not be able to successfully manage and integrate future acquisitions and strategic investments 
there are no assurances that any acquisition or investment opportunities will arise or if they do  that they will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic investments involve risks that the businesses  products or technology acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses or technology acquired will prove incorrect  that the acquired businesses or technology may not be integrated successfully  and that the acquisitions may strain management resources 
the integration of operations of acquired companies  including the consolidation of systems  procedures  personnel and facilities  the relocation of staff  and the achievement of anticipated cost savings  economies of scale and other business efficiencies  presents significant challenges  particularly if several acquisitions occur within a short period of time 
the company may not be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel that may be acquired in the future  and the failure to do so could adversely affect the company 
the company may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings 
the company may be party to various legal proceedings which could result in substantial costs and could harm the company s on going operations 
the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
the company cannot provide assurance that an action or proceeding will not be commenced against it  or that the company will prevail in any such action or proceeding 
an unfavorable resolution of any legal action or proceeding could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company does accrue for the anticipated costs associated with legal matters in its consolidated balance sheets as of june  and there can be no assurance these accruals are adequate to cover the actual costs incurred related to these matters 
the company s intellectual property rights may expire  or they may not sufficiently protect its products  or the company s products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets and non disclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to obtain and maintain us and foreign patent protection for its products 
the company currently has a number of pending patent applications 
it is not possible to determine whether the company will obtain any patents from these applications 
additionally  the claims in previously issued patents or pending applications may not provide the company with significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable 
additionally  third party patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property  which are not known to the company  may block or compete with the company s existing product lines 

table of contents litigation may be necessary to enforce the company s patents  to protect existing proprietary rights  or to defend third party infringement claims 
the defense and prosecution of patent claims  including these pending claims  as well as participation in other inter party proceedings  can be expensive and time consuming  even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable 
if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding were adverse  the company could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties  could be required to obtain licenses from third parties  may be forced to redesign or rename its products  or could be required to cease sales of the affected products 
additionally  the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary by country  therefore  any patent issues faced by the company may not be uniformly resolved 
the company is exposed to certain credit risks  resulting primarily from customer sales 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from homecare providers  distributors  hospitals  and independent leasing companies 
the company s customers are located throughout the us and around the world 
a significant portion of products sold to providers  distributors and hospitals  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs or through private insurance programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on the liquidity and profitability of the company s customer base 
in addition  because a concentration of market share exists in the sleep and home respiratory product industry in the us among national and large regional homecare providers  the company experiences a comparable concentration of credit risk with these customers 
the company records an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern  financial condition  cash flows  and credit history of its customers as well as current industry and economic conditions 
respironics s inability to collect on its trade accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce the company s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
stock based compensation in conjunction with the adoption of fasb r  the company is required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company s expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended june   the company used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of based upon the calculated volatility at the time of issuance 
the company determined the weighted average option life assumption based on the exercise behavior that different employee groups exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
for stock option grants made during the year ended june   the company used a weighted average expected option life assumption of years 
as of june   the total unrecognized stock based compensation expenses related to non vested stock awards was  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  if the expected option life of grants made during the year ended june  were to increase by one year and simultaneously the expected volatility was to increase by basis points  recognized compensation expenses would have increased by approximately  for the year ended june   and unrecognized compensation expense would have increased by  as of june  revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when title to product passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment to a customer location and  in the case of rental revenue and long term service contracts  is recognized ratably over the period the product is rented or service is performed 
for those sales shipped fob destination  revenue is recognized upon receipt by the customer 
the company s standard conditions of sale do not include customer acceptance  installation  price protection agreements  or other post shipment obligations 
at times  the company performs installation and or training after certain products are shipped as a service to customers at their request 
as of june  and the amounts of deferred service revenue for post shipment obligations were immaterial in relation to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s revenue transactions are sometimes made pursuant to standard terms and conditions included in distributor agreements and customer contracts 
these contracts generally include price lists that apply to specified products shipped to customers during the terms of their agreement 
these contracts also generally include rights of return provisions that only permit customers to return sold product in the case of a defective product or order entry  shipping  or similar error made by the company 
product returns  which are recorded as a reduction of net sales and cost of sales  are generally insignificant in relation to net sales 
the company accrues for estimated sales returns and allowances based on historical trends  adjusted for specific product programs and individual transactions where appropriate 

table of contents the company does not offer variable sales prices for subsequent events  all prices are fixed when customers orders are received 
certain customers and group purchasing organizations contracts provide customers with price rebates based on their level of purchases from the company 
rebates are accrued by the company as a reduction in net sales as they are earned by customers 
price discounts that may be awarded to customers for payment of invoices within specified periods are recorded as reductions to net sales at the time of payment and are generally insignificant in relation to net sales 
as part of the company s sales process  pricing discounts may be provided for large orders to support sales initiatives  including new product introductions 
in the company s domestic sales activities  a number of independent manufacturers representatives are used to sell the company s products 
these independent representatives are paid a direct commission on sales made to customers in their respective territories and are an integral component of the company s domestic sales force 
the company does not ship or sell its products to these representatives  and therefore does not recognize any revenue from transactions with these independent representatives 
the sec s sab nos 
and  revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab nos 
and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
provisions to increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years ended june    and substantially all of the company s receivables are due from homecare providers  distributors  hospitals  and independent leasing companies 
the company s customers are located throughout the us and around the world 
a significant portion of products sold to homecare providers  distributors and hospitals  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement or private insurance programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on a homecare provider  distributor and hospital liquidity and profitability 
in addition  because a concentration of market share exists in the sleep and home respiratory product industry in the us among national and large regional homecare providers  the company experiences a comparable concentration of credit risk with these customers 
the company records an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern  financial condition  cash flows  and credit history of its customers as well as current industry and economic conditions 
adverse changes in these factors may impair the ability of the company s customers to make payments  as a consequence  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable may be required 
the company is also contingently liable  within certain limits  in the event of a customer default on unpaid installment receivables initiated by or transferred to several independent leasing companies in connection with customer leasing programs 
the company monitors the collection status of these installment receivables and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
provisions to increase the allowance for obsolete and excess inventory are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years ended june    and the estimated allowance is based on the company s review of inventories on hand compared to historical and estimated future usage and sales 
if it is determined that inventory on hand is in excess of estimated future usage and sales because of changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions  product obsolescence  changes in customer demand  or other reasons  additional allowances for obsolete and excess inventory may need to be provided 
the establishment of these additional allowances may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
intangible assets intangible assets are comprised primarily of intellectual property rights  patent registration costs  product technology  customer contracts and relationships  and employee agreements 
intangible assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives  which are based on the company s estimates of the period that the assets will generate positive cash flows 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such carrying amounts are determined to be unrecoverable because of changes in technology  extended delays in obtaining regulatory approval  competition  significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  or other reasons  the carrying amounts would be written down to their fair market values 
these adjustments may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the significance of the carrying amounts and the extent of the required adjustments 
contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  the company incurs liabilities that may be difficult to quantify precisely  such as future warranty obligations  potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters  and tax exposures 
the company follows the requirements of fasb no 
 accounting for contingencies  which dictate when a charge to income should be taken to accrue for a loss contingency 
these requirements necessitate the application of judgment regarding the likelihood and amount of the liability 
the company will adopt fin effective on july  to address uncertainty in income tax positions
