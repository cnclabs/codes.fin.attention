item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
highlights we achieved a number of key successes in and in early these include o net income in the third and fourth quarters of this was despite carrying losses during these two periods from our software solutions segment and incurring over  of expenses in launching our united kingdom network 
o significant increases in cash flows from operations during the third and fourth quarters of in  cash flows from operations were  and  in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
this represents a significant increase over the first and second quarter cash from operations of  and  respectively  and reflects the trend of improved quarterly operating results 
o north america ntn itv network growth the site count grew by sites  the highest single year increase in years  and the year end count exceeded  sites for the first time in company history 
o united kingdom network launch we launched our itv hospitality network in the united kingdom as the buzztime network to pubs and restaurants 
though there were only sites in operation at year end  our marketing programs began to drive sales leads in early and generated sales in january and sales in february 
we believe the united kingdom will be a strong focus of growth this year  and in future years 
o broader licensing distribution we continued our distribution of games to emerging interactive game platforms  adding a retail product and broadening its presence on cable television  satellite television and mobile phones 
o launch of multi player games on cable television we announced the availability of the first multi player game room products for digital cable interactive television  and the products were successfully launched in february we believe these products are a breakthrough in cable offerings and  when combined with our other game products  may help achieve broader success in cable itv 
o profitability in the wireless paging segment our wireless segment generated profits of  in versus a net loss of  in o key flagship installations for software products we achieved best of breed installations for some of our software products in  including flagship installations of our prohost table management system at flagship hard rock cafe restaurants in new york s times square and in orlando  florida 
o strong national accounts in our software solutions segment we invested heavily in new software solutions product development in for key national contracts  but recognized little or no revenue on those contracts 
despite posting losses during  national sales installations are proceeding in the first quarter of o intended sale of assets in late  we announced that we were considering offers for the sale of ntn wireless and software solutions  as we intend to focus our investments into our entertainment businesses 
at the time of this filing  discussions with several interested parties are on hold pending the assignment of certain contracts 
until the sale  we intend to continue growing both ntn wireless and software solutions as their success continues in the hospitality marketplace 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred costs and revenues  depreciation of broadcast equipment  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we record deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with installing new customer sites 
based on sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  we amortize these amounts over an estimated three year average life of a customer relationship 
o we incur a relatively significant level of depreciation expense in relationship to our operating income 
the amount of depreciation expense in any fiscal year is largely related to the estimated life of handheld wireless playmaker devices  vsat satellite dishes and associated electronics and the computers located at our customer sites 
the playmakers are depreciated over a four year life  vsat dishes and associated electronics over a four year life and the computers over a three year life 
the depreciable life of these assets was determined based on their estimated useful life  which considers anticipated technology changes 
if our playmakers  vsat dishes and associated electronics and the computers turn out to have longer lives  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly reduced in those future periods 
conversely  if the playmakers  vsat dishes and associated electronics and the computers turn out to have shorter lives  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly increased in those future periods 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we reserve for all accounts that have suspended or terminated our ntn itv network services  all auto debit customers with balances that are greater than days past due  plus of all outstanding balances for itv customers and of outstanding balances for ntn wireless and software solutions customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based on assumptions about future sales and supply on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o revenues from sales of software generally contain multiple elements  and are recorded in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable  provided that vendor specific evidence exists for any undelivered elements  namely annual support and maintenance 
along with the basic software license  our customers have the option to elect post contract support pcs for an additional fee  which is based on a stipulated percentage of the license fee 
pcs consists of technical support as well as unspecified software upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
if  at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if  at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or when payment is received 
if an arrangement allows for customer acceptance  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
revenue from development services consists of customizations and  therefore  we recognize revenue from development services as the services are performed under the agreements 
we recognize revenues from pcs  such as maintenance  on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
additionally  we provide consulting and training services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
o we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions 
at december   the combined net amount of  of goodwill and intangible assets represented of total assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
as of january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase combination determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment for software solutions and ntn canada  inc  as of september   and for ntn wireless as of december   and concluded that there was no indication of impairment 
we retained a third party valuation firm to assist in calculating fair values 
the analysis was based on consideration of the market value of comparable publicly traded companies  the market value of similar companies involved in business combinations  and an income approach of discounting the projected cash flows of operations 
the projections of those units involved a number of assumptions and estimates  including revenue growth and operating margins  which we believe are reasonable based on existing operations and prospective business opportunities 
we completed our evaluation and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as the fair values exceeded carrying values  including goodwill 
the amount of goodwill as of december  was  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
we continually monitor for any potential indicators of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and we have determined that no such indicators have arisen to date 
any impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
o sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sec sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of  and business outlook for  the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
we do not have any of the following o off balance sheet arrangements except for purchase orders  purchase commitments and operating leases  o certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value or speculative or hedging instruments  or o relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from any non independent relationship other than the related party transactions discussed in item certain relationships and related transactions  or which are so non material to fall below the materiality threshold of such item 
assessments of functional currencies 
the united states dollar is our functional currency  except for our operations in canada and the united kingdom 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this accounting standard  which is effective for annual periods beginning after june   requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no

 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  are required to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair value 
sfas no 
r is effective for the first annual reporting period after june  we will adopt this statement effective january  sfas no 
r allows public companies to adopt its requirement using one of the following transition methods a a modified prospective method in which compensation cost for all share based payments granted after the effective date is recognized based on the requirements of sfas no 
r and compensation costs for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas no 
r is recognized based on sfas no 
 or b a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method and also permits entities to restate prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized in its sfas no 
pro forma disclosures 
we will be adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
we estimate that operating results will be reduced by additional non cash compensation expense of approximately  similar to the pro forma amount for due to the adoption of this standard 
the actual impact of adopting sfas no 
r in could differ from this estimate depending on the number and timing of options granted during  as well as their vesting period and vesting criteria 
our assessment is based on the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price  employee s stock option exercise behaviors and interest rates 
as such  actual stock option expense may differ materially from this estimate 
in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities  as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not believe that this will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
background our business is developing and distributing interactive entertainment and wireless information and communications products 
we operate our business principally through two operating units the ntn hospitality technologies division and buzztime 
the ntn hospitality technologies division includes the ntn itv network  ntn wireless and software solutions 
revenues generated and operating income loss by our two business units are illustrated below 
the data presented below includes allocations of corporate expenses and elimination of intercompany charges 
years ended december  revenues ntn hospitality technologies division    buzztime    total    operating income loss ntn hospitality technologies division    buzztime    total    revenue from ntn hospitality technologies division is generated primarily from providing an interactive entertainment service which serves as a marketing and promotional vehicle for the hospitality industry  from its wireless business with restaurant on site paging systems and electronic data managed comment cards and from its hardware and software enterprise solutions 
revenue for buzztime entertainment is primarily generated from the distribution of its digital trivia game show content  as well as revenue related to production services for third parties  and from performance under a trial agreement with a major cable operator 
results of operations following is a comparative discussion by fiscal year of the results of operations for the three years ended december  we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations for the periods presented 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operations for resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss  for revenues revenue of the ntn hospitality technologies division increased by  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a net increase in site count of the revenue contribution from the three operating segments of the division for and are illustrated on the following table components of hospitality technologies division revenue change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    total revenue of division    within the ntn itv network  we have several revenue contributors our core subscription revenue  advertising revenue  installation revenue  revenue from our canadian operations since and revenue from our united kingdom operations since the primary revenue components are illustrated on the following table components of ntn itv network revenue change subscription revenues    uk   subscription installation revenue from canadian operations    advertising revenue united states    advertising revenue canada    installation revenue    total ntn itv network    as noted in the above table  our subscription revenue from core hospitality operations  including canada and the united kingdom  increased by  or  due to an increase in net site count 
in  the ntn itv network generated domestic advertising revenue of approximately  compared to approximately  in this  increase was due to the addition of several new advertising clients 
domestic installation revenue associated with installing new customer locations increased  or 
this was primarily due to the strong installations in the ntn itv network customer site count in the united states was  at december  this was an increase of sites from the united states site count of  as of december  the customer site count in canada was at december  this was an increase of sites from the canadian site count of approximately as of december  buzztime s revenues increased  or  to  in from  in the primary factors in the increase included licensing fees approximately  in compared to zero in from game products  higher levels of license fees from united states and canadian satellite operators for distribution of buzztime trivia to their users on a subscription basis  and increased license and development fees from a major cable operator 
as a result of the above factors  our consolidated revenues increased  or  to  in from  in operating expenses direct operating costs direct operating costs increased  or  to  in from  in a significant amount of this increase was a combination of increases in technical site visit fees  communication fees  freight  depreciation and installation fees 
the following table compares the direct costs for each of our operating segments between and direct operating costs change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    ntn hospitality technologies division    buzztime    consolidated company    direct operating costs in the ntn itv network increased by  in this increase was due to increases in the number of technical site visits associated with new software releases 
communications increased due to higher costs of the satellite service and the acquisition of additional bandwidth 
demand for additional playmaker devices and conversion of canadian sites to ditv from dos disk operating system drove increases in freight and depreciation 
prior to our acquisition of that operation  the site equipment in canada was largely fully depreciated 
the ditv conversion of canadian sites as well as continued strong installations in contributed to increased installation expense 
the  decrease in software solutions direct operating costs was due to a reduction in hardware component associated software sales in versus  which also contributed to the increase in gross margin from to 
the  increase in ntn wireless direct operating costs relates to the cost of goods sold associated with the ntn wireless revenue increase of  in noted above 
the gross margin of ntn wireless in is  a increase from the gross margin of 
the gross margin increase was due to overall costs of goods sold reduction  as well as selling more of the higher margin pilot series product 
the  increase in buzztime s direct operating costs was driven by an increased level of personnel costs for development related to non deployable service platforms 
non cash charge related to software product sale on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with intura solutions lp intura  a texas limited partnership  pursuant to which we sold the point of sale software products developed and maintained by our software solutions segment 
the primary software products sold by us to intura were vision  relief manager plus rmp  store link plus slp  sell more pizzas and other legacy products as well as a non exclusive right to develop and market the enterprise software 
we received a non dilutable partnership interest in intura in the transaction and will receive of intura s revenues received during the next two years  up to a maximum of  further  intura will provide software development maintenance services for the rmp and slp software for two years we continue to retain the rights to the maintenance and support revenue from the legacy products 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to estimate the value of our ownership interest in intura 
based upon that analysis  we concluded that the fair value of our investment in intura was approximately  additionally  based on that analysis  we concluded that there was no impairment of the goodwill in the software solutions segment as a result of this transaction 
the transfer of the software products  which we carried as part of our intangible assets  resulted in a one time  non cash charge of  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  in from  in more than half of this increase resulted from our expansion into the united kingdom

the remainder of the sg a increase of  in the ntn itv network s domestic operations came from a variety of items including  in commission expense associated with the increased volume of sales and  increase in bad debt expense 
sg a expenses increased  in the ntn wireless segment largely due to increased salaries and benefits associated with additional sales personnel  commission expense associated with the higher sales volume compared to  and facility expense associated with moving to a larger facility to accommodate sales growth 
the  decrease in the software solutions segment is primarily due to reductions in personnel  travel and marketing related expenses 
the  sg a decrease in the buzztime segment was largely due to personnel reduction resulting from the completion of development projects 
sg a expenses include an allocation of our corporate sg a to the segments based on a variety of factors  including headcount  square footage of facilities and other factors 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense decreased by  or  to  in compared to  in this decrease arises from valuation of warrant grants issued and stock price fluctuations throughout when compared to litigation  legal and professional fees litigation  legal and professional fees decreased  or  to  in compared to  in this decrease relates to non recurring legal fees associated with the litigation of the lrs lawsuit in that was dismissed and settled without liability in the first quarter of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization not related to direct operating costs decreased  or  to  in from  in this decrease was due to assets having been fully amortized during research and development expenses research and development expenses were  in and  in research and development expenses  which are salary expense  primarily related to projects to develop new technologies for the ntn itv network 
other income expense interest income and expense interest income decreased  to  in  compared to  in interest expense increased  or  to  in  compared to  in  due to the various capitalized leases entered into for site equipment during other income in  we recorded  of other income that arose from the settlement of a derivative securities lawsuit 
income taxes for the year ended december   the ntn hospitality technologies division had taxable income of cd  in canada and taxable income of us  in the united states 
as a result  ntn hospitality technologies division recorded a tax provision of  in the united states tax expense was substantially reduced through the utilization of both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards generated in prior years 
the tax provision was an  decrease from the  provision for income taxes recorded in ebitda our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased by  to  in from ebitda of  in this ebitda increase was largely a result of the decrease in net loss of  in ebitda is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
nor should ebitda be considered as an alternative to statements of cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is included herein because we believe it is a measure of operating performance that financial analysts  lenders  investors and other interested parties find to be a useful tool for analyzing companies like ntn that carry significant levels of non cash depreciation and amortization charges in comparison to their gaap earnings

for the purpose of this analysis  revenue for ntn itv network includes  and  of other revenue for and  respectively  as shown on our consolidated statements of operations 
the revenue contribution from the three operating segments of the division for and are shown on the following table components of hospitality technologies division revenue change ntn itv network    ntn wireless    software solutions    total revenue of division    within the ntn itv network there are several revenue contributors  including our core subscription revenue  canadian licensing revenue  installation revenue  advertising revenue and as of december   revenue from our canadian operations 
the primary revenue components are broken out in the following table components of ntn itv network revenue change subscription revenues    canadian license revenue   subscription installation revenue from canadian operations    advertising revenue united states    advertising revenue canada    installation revenue    total ntn itv network    as noted in the above table  our subscription revenue from core hospitality operations increased by  or  due to an increase in net site count and average per site revenue 
licensing revenues from our canadian licensee ceased in the fourth quarter of as we finalized the acquisition of the operations of the licensee 
on december   we acquired the operations of our canadian licensee  so we now show the overall revenues of the canadian operation rather than the previous license revenue 
in  the ntn itv network generated domestic advertising revenue of approximately  compared to approximately  in this  decrease was due to several advertising campaigns in the period that ended without comparable campaigns in the period 
installation revenue associated with installing new customer locations decreased  or 
this was primarily due to deferred revenue associated with prior year installations becoming fully amortized 
to a lesser extent  over the past two years  we have adopted a strategy of charging new sites a lower installation fee and higher recurring monthly fees than our previous pricing in order to grow our customer base 
this strategy has had the beneficial impact of increasing our subscription revenues  as noted in the above chart  but it has also reduced the amount of deferred revenue from those new sites that is recognized as installation revenue over an average customer life of three years 
this trend coupled with the falloff of amortization of deferred revenue from prior years led to this lower level of installation revenue 
however  we believe this move to a lower installation fee coupled with higher recurring fees has a greater long term financial benefit to ntn 
we added net new domestic sites in compared to a decrease of net new domestic sites in this domestic site count increase was the largest annual net addition of sites in years 
the ntn itv network customer site count in the united states was  at december  this was an increase of sites from the united states site count of  as of december  the customer site count in canada was at december  this was a decrease of sites from the canadian site count of approximately as of december  buzztime service revenues increased  or  to  in from  in the primary factor in the increase was  from united states and canadian satellite operators for distribution of buzztime trivia to their users on a subscription basis 
there was no comparable satellite related revenue in included  in revenues recognized under a development agreement with a major cable operator compared to  in the remainder of the revenue growth came from a variety of sources including increases in license revenue from suscom  digeo and ictv

that  increase in canadian direct costs was partially offset by a  decrease in domestic direct operating costs 
this  decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in direct depreciation  which  in turn  was caused by an increasing level of fully depreciated broadcast equipment at our customer sites and to a  reduction of communication expenses 
the  increase in the direct operating costs of software solutions largely related to the cost of goods sold associated with twelve months of operations in that segment in compared to five months in the gross margin of software solutions in was  a decrease from the gross margin of 
the gross margin decline was due to a larger hardware component as a percentage of revenue in than in and greater license expense relating to certain microsoft products imbedded in our software 
our hardware revenues typically carry lower margins than our software revenues

we used the publicly traded stock price  as of the date of the transactions  of per share to determine the  fair value of the shares issued 
the consideration allocated to the acquired boxerjam game license was valued at million and we are amortizing it over the estimated contractual life of years  which assumes that we will exercise our five year renewal option 
we determined that  based on the lack of marketability of buzztime common stock and limited convertibility into ntn common stock  the fair value of the buzztime warrants was not material  and no allocation of fair value was made 
on january   media general invested approximately million as one of the purchasers in the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share

ntn canada s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since december  sale of software products on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with intura solutions lp intura  a texas limited partnership  pursuant to which we sold the point of sale software products developed and maintained by our software solutions segment 
in accordance with the asset purchase transaction  gary peek terminated his position as vice president and general manager of our software solutions segment and immediately thereafter commenced his position with intura to oversee business operations 
the primary software products sold by us to intura were vision  relief manager plus rmp  store link plus slp  sell more pizzas and other legacy products as well as a non exclusive right to develop and market the enterprise software 
we received a non dilutable partnership interest in intura in the transaction and will receive a royalty representing of intura s revenues during the two years after february   up to a maximum of  in  we recorded  of such royalties 
further  intura will provide software development maintenance services for the rmp and slp software for two years we continue to retain the rights to the maintenance and support revenue from legacy products 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of our ownership interest in intura 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the fair value of our investment in intura was approximately  additionally  based on this analysis  we considered whether this transaction resulted in any impairment of the goodwill in the software solutions segment and we concluded that it did not result in any such impairment

the offering was purchased primarily by a number of institutional investors and by media general  inc  a related party  which invested approximately million 
future financing needs our liquidity and capital resources  while stronger now than in recent years  remain limited  which may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
however  cash flows from operations have increased significantly as of the third and fourth quarters of in  we experienced the most significant increase in itv site sales in years  with site sales 
we believe that this sales increase can be attributed in large part to our announcement in february of the planned deployment of a wireless electronic multi player version of the popular poker game  texas hold em  on our ntn itv network in additionally  we are halfway through the conversion of approximately canadian ntn itv network sites to our newest itv technology  which allows the play of texas hold em  as well as other new game content 
on february   we announced the deployment of texas hold em to all of our itv sites  which numbered about in north america 
over  we have witnessed continued strong growth of sales for the ntn itv network 
at the nightclub and bar trade show in early march  which is one of our strongest trade shows  we had continued strong sales success 
each new site requires a capital investment of approximately  when connected to the ntn itv network via vsat satellite technology 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to operate our businesses through capital requirements in will additionally depend upon two other growth initiatives 
the first is the launch of our ntn itv network in the united kingdom  beginning with an initial trial of ntn itv network sites that began on march  we believe that a significant growth opportunity exists in the united kingdom for our itv product  and success in sales would require substantial capital for any level of significant deployments 
the second is the intended broad distribution of the buzztime trivia channel in digital cable television systems as sales efforts continue to focus on cable msos the largest multiple system operators in the united states 
with current sites in operation  if this initiative succeeds as planned and we enter into national agreements with those cable operators  we intend to aggressively increase buzztime sales and marketing efforts to more quickly advance our distribution within the united states market 
a primary driver of capital use over the past three years has been the cost of deploying the vsat technology in our ntn itv network 
for more than years  we transmitted our data through the fm satellite one way platform 
in  we were informed that this platform would no longer be available to us after february after considering several alternative delivery channels  we entered into equipment purchase and satellite service agreements in to convert the network to a much higher speed  two way vsat very small aperture technology satellite technology over the two year period ending february these agreements were with the same reseller of satellite services that provided the fm satellite platform to us 
the vsat technology is more expensive than fm  and  with our strong sales in  our cash usage increased to fund the new installations 
on january   after learning that the fm platform life was being extended  we amended our agreements with our satellite services provider to push out the expiration date on the fm satellite platform to february and to modify our vsat equipment purchase and satellite service agreements 
the amendments will help us in three ways first  the modification to the equipment purchase agreement eliminates the requirement to purchase and install a specific amount of vsat equipment 
second  the flexibility will enable us to utilize non satellite based data transmission platforms  such as digital subscriber lines dsl  wireless connectivity or cable modems  for customer sites where such platforms may be appropriate 
we have begun installing some sites with dsl connectivity in areas that cannot be reached by vsat  which lowers the cost of the installations by a significant amount of approximately  per site 
third  the amendment allows us to slow our rate of converting sites from the fm system to the new vsat platform over the remainder of the amended fm satellite services agreement  which is now scheduled to end in february as of december   approximately of our domestic sites had been converted from fm to dsl or vsat 
we anticipate that with the extension of fm sites  an increasing number of dsl installations and the revised vsat agreement  north america installation costs overall and installation costs per site over the coming years will trend down from what was seen in  and we acquired the ntn canada network assets of our canadian licensee in december the previous owner had not converted the canadian customer base to ditv during the to period when our domestic sites were converted  and the canadian network had become antiquated and was rapidly losing customers 
following the purchase  we have been in the process of upgrading the technology for all active sites there 
through december   approximately of the canadian sites had been converted to itv  our newest technology platform  and connected via either vsat or dsl communication platforms 
over the next months  we plan to convert the remaining of our current customer base at a cost on the order of  however  we believe that these canadian capital expenditures will be financed through the operating cash flow we generate in canada 
we also have taken actions to reduce operating losses in two of our segments that produced losses in  as follows o software solutions in february  we sold the vision point of sale product line  which had produced losses  to a new venture formed by the former president of breakaway international 
we retained a ownership in that new venture 
o ntn wireless this segment has been profitable in we believe this segment should produce operating profits going forward  although this segment is very competitive and its gross margins remain under pressure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates  stock market fluctuations  and interest rates 
as of december   we owned common stock of an australian company that is subject to market risk 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  which is net of a  unrealized loss 
this investment is exposed to further market risk in the future based on the operating results of the australian company and stock market fluctuations 
additionally  the value of the investment is further subject to changes in australian currency exchange rates 
at december   a hypothetical decline in the value of the australian dollar would result in a reduction of  in the carrying value of the investment 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
nor do we have any speculative or hedging instruments
