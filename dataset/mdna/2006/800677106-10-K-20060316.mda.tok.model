you should read the following discussion and analysis along with the selected financial data and the financial statements and notes attached to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs and zfns  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and federal government research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
in  we have placed more emphasis on higher value therapeutic product development and related strategic partnerships and less emphasis on our enabling technology collaborations 
we believe this shift in emphasis has the potential to increase the return on investment to our stockholders by allocating capital resources to higher value  therapeutic product development activities 
at the same time  it may reduce our revenues over the next several years and it increases our financial risk by increasing expenses associated with product development 
we have filed an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda and have initiated a phase clinical trial of a zfp therapeutic in patients with diabetic neuropathy during the first quarter of development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products are gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs in gene therapy may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and expenses for patent prosecution  trademark registration and technology licenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly as we focus increasingly on development of zfp therapeutics 
the company is also developing zinc finger nucleases zfns for therapeutic gene correction and therapeutic gene modification as a treatment and possible cure for certain monogenic and infectious diseases 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs and zfns as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs and clinical research aspects of biotherapeutic development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate 
table of contents expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received under such agreements are deferred until the above criteria are met and the research services are performed 
sangamo s federal government research grants are typically multi year agreements and provide for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under grant agreements is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred 
grant reimbursements are typically received on a quarterly basis and are subject to the issuing agency s right of audit 
sangamo recognizes revenue from its enabling technology collaborations when zfp based products are delivered to the collaborators  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  there are no unfulfilled obligations  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  sangamo receives partial payments from these collaborations prior to the delivery of zfp based products and the recognition of these revenues is deferred until the zfp based products are delivered  the risk of ownership has passed to the collaborator and all performance obligations have been satisfied 
upfront or signature payments received upon the signing of an enabling technology agreement are generally recognized ratably over the applicable period of the agreement or as zfp based products are delivered 
milestone payments under research  partnering  or licensing agreements are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no further significant performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue arrangements entered into after june   that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criterion is considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
stock based compensation sangamo accounts for employee and director stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and has adopted the disclosure only alternative of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
stock options granted to non employees  including scientific advisory board members  are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  which requires the value of such options to be measured and compensation expense to be recorded as they vest over a performance period 
the fair value of such options is determined using 
table of contents the black scholes model 
pursuant to fas  as amended by fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the effect on net loss and related net loss per share has been calculated  had compensation cost for stock based compensation plans been determined based upon the fair value method prescribed under fas see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements federal government research grants total revenues we are increasing the emphasis of our research and development activities on zfp therapeutics 
even with this change in resource allocation  we anticipate increasing revenues over the next several years primarily related to our research license and commercial option agreement with dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of dow chemical corporation 
total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and federal government research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to  in  and million in the increase in from was principally attributable to increased revenues of approximately  related to our research collaboration agreement with pfizer  increased revenues of approximately  in connection with our research license and commercial option agreement with das  and increased revenues of approximately  in connection with our collaboration in the field of regenerative medicine with lifescan 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of  from our therapeutics partnership with edwards lifesciences corporation edwards  as well as lower revenues of approximately  associated with other enabling technology collaborations 
the decreased revenue from edwards is due to the submission of the first ind by edwards for a licensed product under the agreement with sangamo 
the decrease in from was principally attributable to decreased revenues of approximately  from our therapeutics partnership with edwards  due to completion of our preclinical research and edwards payments for those activities under the agreement  as well as decreased revenues of  associated with other enabling technology collaborations 
federal government research grant revenues were  in   in  and  in the increase in over and was primarily attributable to increased revenue of  in connection with our advanced technology program grant awarded by the national institute of standards and technology 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that  since the inception  revenues related to this grant had been under recorded by  a one time adjustment for this amount was recorded during the fourth quarter of and is the primary reason for the increased federal government research grant revenues in as compared to and we plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants

we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in from was principally due to increased expenses associated with our phase clinical trial in patients with diabetic neuropathy of approximately  increased expenses for laboratory supplies of approximately  increased external research expenses of approximately  and increased consulting expenses of approximately  this was partially offset by decreased expenses associated with pre clinical studies of  and facilities of approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in facility related expenses was primarily caused by decreased depreciation expense associated with laboratory equipment 
the increase of  in from was principally due to pre clinical studies and manufacturing costs of million in connection with our diabetic neuropathy program 
this was partially offset by decreased expenses for salaries and related benefits of  due to lower headcount  and laboratory supplies of  our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for cardiovascular disease  neurological disorders  cancer and monogenic diseases  zfp engineered cell lines  protein production and zfp tfs and zfns for applications in agricultural biotechnology

table of contents below is a summary of our programs funded internally and the development stage of the leading application internal programs program stage zfp therapeutics clinical preclinical research zfp tf engineered cell lines for the manufacture of protein pharmaceuticals research agricultural biotechnology research due to the early stage of the company s various internal research and development projects  the company does not track costs associated with its internal projects on a project by project basis 
drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads  we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
general and administrative expenses were million during  million in and million in the increase of  was principally due to increased salary and benefit expenses of approximately  partially offset by decreased expenses associated with corporate communications of approximately  the increase of  in from was principally due to increased expenses in connection with programs for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment of approximately  as well as increased expenses of  related to corporate communications

liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
during  the use of cash related to our net operating loss of million and net increases in asset balances of  this was partially offset by net increases in liability balances of million  principally due to an increase in deferred revenue of million  primarily related to the receipt of a license payment of million during the fourth quarter of per the terms of the research license and commercial option agreement with das

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities million in   in and  in during  the company completed a registered direct offering to institutional and strategic investors for a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share to the investors  resulting in net proceeds to sangamo of approximately million 
all other cash provided by financing activities for  and was solely related to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to stock options exercises 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular  in support of our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations through we may need to raise additional capital to fund our zfp therapeutic development activities 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have incurred losses 
as of december   sangamo had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has state operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through the company also has federal and state research and development tax credits of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in the year through and the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of the company s net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees  milestones and royalties due from sales of zfp tfs 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within the net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the 
table of contents cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a revision of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their values 
we expect to calculate the value of share based payments under sfas r on a basis substantially consistent with the fair value approach of sfas we will adopt sfas r in our fiscal quarter beginning january   using the modified prospective method 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations in that fiscal quarter and in each subsequent quarter  although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity 
we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adoption because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future as well as certain assumptions that can materially affect the calculation of the value share based payments to employees and directors 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per common share in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments 
the investments are available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
we invest excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
if market interest rates were to increase by one percent from december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by less than  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
we recognized a loss on foreign currency translation of  in and gains on foreign currency translation of  and  for and  respectively
