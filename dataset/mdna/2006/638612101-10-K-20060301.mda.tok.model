overview following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
see part i  item business overview and part i  item business capital stock transactions for a description of the company and its ownership structure 
business segments management of the company views its business primarily based on the underlying products  and this is the basis used for defining its reportable segments 
the company reports four segments individual investments  retirement plans  individual protection  and corporate and other 
the primary segment profitability measure that management uses is pre tax operating earnings  which is calculated by adjusting income from continuing operations before federal income taxes  discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principles to exclude net realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items  except for operating items periodic net coupon settlements on non qualifying derivatives  trading portfolio realized gains and losses  and trading portfolio valuation changes  net realized gains and losses related to securitizations  and the adjustment to amortization of dac related to net realized gains and losses 
see part i  item business business segments for a description of the components of each segment 
the following table summarizes pre tax operating earnings loss by segment for the years ended december dollars in millions change change individual investments retirement plans individual protection corporate and other revenues and expenses the company earns revenues and generates cash primarily from policy charges  life insurance premiums and net investment income 
policy charges include asset fees  which are earned primarily from separate account values generated from the sale of individual and group variable annuities and investment life insurance products  cost of insurance charges earned on universal life insurance products  which are assessed on the amount of insurance in force in excess of the related policyholder account value  administrative fees  which include fees charged per contract on a variety of the company s products and premium loads on universal life insurance products  and surrender fees  which are charged as a percentage of premiums withdrawn during a specified period for annuity and certain life insurance contracts 
net investment income includes earnings on investments supporting fixed annuities  the mtn program and certain life insurance products  and earnings on invested assets not allocated to product segments  all net of related investment expenses 
other income includes asset fees  administrative fees  commissions and other income earned by subsidiaries of the company that provide administrative  marketing and distribution services 

table of contents management makes decisions concerning the sale of invested assets based on a variety of market  business  tax and other factors 
all realized gains and losses generated by these sales  charges related to other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities and other investments  and changes in valuation allowances on mortgage loans on real estate are reported in realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items 
also included are changes in the fair values of derivatives qualifying as fair value hedges and the related changes in the fair values of hedged items  the ineffective  or excluded  portion of cash flow hedges  changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  and periodic net coupon settlements on non qualifying derivatives 
the company s primary expenses include interest credited to policyholder account values  other benefits and claims  amortization of dac and general business operating expenses 
interest credited principally relates to individual and group fixed annuities  funding agreements backing the company s mtn program and certain life insurance products 
other benefits and claims include policyholder benefits in excess of policyholder account values for universal life and individual deferred annuities and net claims and provisions for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities 
profitability the company s profitability largely depends on its ability to effectively price and manage risk on its various products  administer customer funds and control operating expenses 
lapse rates on existing contracts also impact profitability 
in particular  the company s profitability is driven by fee income on separate account products  general account asset levels and management s ability to manage interest spread income 
interest spread income is comprised of net investment income  excluding any applicable allocated charges for invested capital  less interest credited to policyholder account values 
interest spread income can vary depending on crediting rates offered by the company  performance of the investment portfolio  including the rate of prepayments  changes in market interest rates  the competitive environment  and other factors 
in recent periods  management has taken actions to address low interest rate environments and the resulting impact on interest spread margins  including reducing commissions on fixed annuity sales  launching new products with new guaranteed rates  discontinuing the sale of its leading annual reset fixed annuities and invoking contractual provisions that limit the amount of variable annuity deposits allocated to the guaranteed fixed option 
also  the majority of new business now contains lower floor guarantees than were historically provided 
in addition  life insurance profits are significantly impacted by mortality  morbidity and persistency experience 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   management decided to discontinue the following operations cap pro  a majority owned subsidiary of nfs that provided broker dealer  registered investment advisor and insurance agency services to producers of certain certified public accounting firms  nfsb  a wholly owned subsidiary of nfs that sold variable and fixed annuity products  and tbg lynch  a wholly owned subsidiary of tbg financial that distributes boli products 
the company s loss on discontinued operations of million  net of taxes  includes the following cap pro million  primarily related to goodwill impairment  nfsb million  primarily related to a loss on the sale of the business  and tbg lynch million  the loss expected to be realized from the planned sale of the business  this loss was recognized as a reduction in related goodwill as of december  the results of operations of cap pro  nfsb and tbg lynch are reflected as discontinued operations for and all prior years 
see note n to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of the report for additional information on discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle the company adopted statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop  
table of contents effective january   which resulted in a million charge  net of taxes  as the cumulative effect of adoption of this accounting principle 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for a complete description of sop critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the most critical estimates include those used to determine the following the balance  recoverability and amortization of dac for investment products and universal life insurance products  the balance and amortization of voba  impairment losses on investments  valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  federal income tax provisions  goodwill impairment  the liability for future policy benefits  and pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
note and note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report provide a summary of significant accounting policies and a discussion of recently issued accounting standards  respectively 
deferred policy acquisition costs for investment products and universal life insurance products the company has deferred the costs of acquiring investment products and universal life insurance products business  principally commissions  certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting department  and certain variable sales expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new and renewal business 
investment products primarily consist of individual and group variable and fixed deferred annuities 
universal life insurance products include universal life insurance  variable universal life insurance  coli and other interest sensitive life insurance policies 
dac is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing at the end of each reporting period 
for investment products principally individual and group annuities and universal life insurance products  dac is being amortized with interest over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from projected interest margins  asset fees  cost of insurance charges  administration fees  surrender charges  and net realized gains and losses less policy benefits and policy maintenance expenses 
the dac asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted to reflect the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale  as described in note b to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 
the most significant assumptions that are involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently growth per year 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the dac models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  and as part of its pre set parameters  the company s reversion to the mean process generally limits returns to during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of dac reported for investment products and universal life insurance products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in dac amortization expense referred to as dac unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  
table of contents increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of dac amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of dac amortization 
management evaluates the appropriateness of the individual variable annuity dac balance within pre set parameters 
these parameters are designed to appropriately reflect the company s long term expectations with respect to individual variable annuity contracts while also evaluating the potential impact of short term experience on the company s recorded individual variable annuity dac balance 
if the recorded balance of individual variable annuity dac falls outside of these parameters for a prescribed period of time  or if the recorded balance falls outside of these parameters and management determines it is not reasonably possible to get back within the parameters during this period of time  assumptions are required to be unlocked and dac is recalculated using revised best estimate assumptions 
otherwise  dac is not unlocked to reflect updated assumptions 
if dac assumptions were unlocked and revised  the company would continue to use the reversion to the mean process 
for other investment products and universal life insurance products  dac is adjusted each quarter to reflect revised best estimate assumptions  including the use of a reversion to the mean methodology over the next three years as it relates to net separate account performance 
any resulting dac unlocking adjustments are reflected currently in the consolidated statements of income 
value of business acquired as a result of the acquisition of nfn in and the application of purchase accounting  the company reports an intangible asset representing the estimated fair value of the business in force and the portion of the purchase price that was allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the life insurance and annuity contracts existing as of the closing date of the nfn acquisition 
the value assigned to voba was supported by an independent valuation study commissioned by the company and executed by a team of qualified valuation experts  including actuarial consultants 
the expected future cash flows used in determining such value were based on actuarially determined projections by major lines of business of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  changes in reserves  operating expenses  investment income and other factors 
these projections considered all known or expected factors at the valuation date based on the judgment of management 
the actual experience on purchased business  to some extent  has and may continue to vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums  investment spreads  investment gains and losses  mortality and morbidity costs  or other factors 
amortization of voba occurs with interest over the anticipated lives of the major lines of business to which it relates initially ranging from to years in relation to estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums  as appropriate 
if estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums differ from expectations  the amortization of voba is adjusted on a retrospective or prospective basis  as appropriate 
the voba asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted annually for the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale had such gains and losses been realized and allocated to the product lines  as described in note b to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report 
the recoverability of voba is evaluated annually 
if the evaluation indicates that the existing insurance liabilities  together with the present value of future net cash flows from the blocks of business acquired  is insufficient to recover voba  the difference  if any  is charged to expense as accelerated amortization of voba 
for those products amortized in relation to estimated gross profits  the most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is currently 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the assumption  the company 
table of contents assumes different performance levels over the next three years such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the voba models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  the company s reversion to the mean process generally limits returns to during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of voba reported for all products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in voba amortization expense voba unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of voba amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of voba amortization 
impairment losses on investments management regularly reviews each investment in its fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
under the company s accounting policy for equity securities and debt securities that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that may limit the company s ability to fully recover cost  an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless the company has both the ability and intent to hold the investment until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur in a reasonable period of time 
also  for such debt securities management estimates cash flows over the life of purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
if management estimates that the fair value of its beneficial interest is not greater than or equal to its carrying value based on current information and events  and if there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate considering both timing and amount  then the company recognizes an other than temporary impairment and writes down the purchased beneficial interest to fair value 
for other debt securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when the company does not have the ability and intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that the company will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  management s intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment 
impairment losses are recorded on investments in long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
significant changes in the factors management considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses  including significant deterioration in the credit worthiness of individual issuers  could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate the company provides valuation allowances for impairments of mortgage loans on real estate based on a review by portfolio managers 
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current 
table of contents information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when management determines that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established equal to the difference between the carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
in addition to the valuation allowance on specific loans  the company maintains an unallocated allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  but not yet specifically identified by loan 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in net realized gains and losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items 
loans in foreclosure are placed on non accrual status 
interest received on non accrual status mortgage loans on real estate is included in net investment income in the period received 
the valuation allowance account for mortgage loans on real estate is maintained at a level believed adequate by management and reflects management s best estimate of probable credit losses  including losses incurred at the balance sheet date but not yet identified by specific loan 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
significant changes in the factors management considers in determining the valuation allowance for mortgage loans on real estate could result in a significant change in the valuation allowance reported in the consolidated financial statements 
federal income taxes management provides for federal income taxes based on amounts it believes it ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  management may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the internal revenue service irs  and the company is currently under examination for the tax years 
management has established tax reserves representing its best estimate of additional amounts it may be required to pay if certain tax positions it has taken are challenged and ultimately denied by the irs 
these reserves are reviewed regularly and are adjusted as events occur that management believes impact its liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits or substantial agreement on the deductibility non deductibility of uncertain items  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  release of administrative guidance or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue 
management believes its tax reserves reasonably provide for potential assessments that may result from irs examinations and other tax related matters for all open tax years 
a significant component of the tax reserve is related to the separate account dividends received deduction drd 
the company has not reached any final agreements with the irs with respect to the drd  and there can be no assurance that any such agreements will be reached 
however  resolution of the separate account drd and or other identified issues could result in a potentially significant adjustment to the company s future results of operations 
goodwill in connection with acquisitions of operating entities  the company recognizes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for 
table of contents impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter 
goodwill of a reporting unit also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the reporting units  including the method used to determine fair value  discount rates  expected levels of cash flows  revenues and earnings  and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions 
management believes that all judgments and assumptions made in connection with goodwill impairment testing are reasonable based on the underlying facts and circumstances evaluated 
however  variances in actual results from expectations or changes in expectations for future cash flows  revenues and or earnings could result in significant future goodwill impairment charges 
strategic restructurings also could result in the write off of goodwill 
future policy benefits the process of calculating reserve amounts for a life insurance organization involves the use of a number of assumptions  including those related to persistency  mortality  morbidity and interest rates 
the company calculates its liability for future policy benefits for investment products in the accumulation phase and universal life and variable universal life insurance policies as the policy account balance  which represents participants net premiums and deposits plus investment performance and interest credited less applicable contract charges 
the company s liability for funding agreements to an unrelated third party trust equals the balance that accrues to the benefit of the contractholder  including interest credited 
the funding agreements constitute insurance obligations considered annuity contracts under ohio insurance laws 
the liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance policies has been calculated by the net level premium method using interest rates varying from to and estimates of mortality  morbidity  investment yields and withdrawals that were used or being experienced at the time the policies were issued 
the liability for future policy benefits for payout annuities has been calculated using the present value of future benefits and maintenance costs discounted using interest rates varying from to 
also  as of december  and  the calculated reserve was adjusted to reflect the incremental reserve that would be required if unrealized gains and losses had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at lower interest rates  which would have resulted in the use of a lower discount rate 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb assumptions are revised at least annually in conjunction with preparation of the company s annual report on form k 
the pension expense for substantially all of the company s employees and certain agents totaled million  an increase of million over pension expense of million 
expenses increased at the plan level primarily due to decreasing interest rates  reflected in a lower discount rate 
the discount rate used to value cash flows was lowered to to determine pension expense from for  and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was lowered to for from for the and opeb expense for substantially all of the company s employees and certain agents totaled million and million  respectively 
the discount rate used to value cash flows was lowered to to determine opeb expense from used in  and the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was lowered to for from for 
table of contents management employs a prospective building block approach in establishing the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
this process is integrated with the determination of other economic assumptions such as salary scale 
the discount rate is set by reference to the yield on high quality corporate bonds to reflect pension settlement rates 
for december  and  the reference bond portfolio was the moody s aa long term corporate bond index 
for pension benefits  a downward adjustment of basis points in the discount rate was included for plan administration and other expenses 
since the opeb liability includes both claims and administration expenses  a similar downward adjustment was not appropriate for the opeb discount rate 
the historical real rate of return for the reference bonds is subtracted from the yield on these bonds to generate an assumed inflation rate 
the expected real rates of return on various asset sub classes are developed based on historic risk premiums for those sub classes 
the expected real rates of return  reduced for investment expenses  are applied to the target allocation of each asset sub class to produce an expected real rate of return for the target portfolio 
this expected real rate of return varies by plan and changes when the plan s target investment portfolio changes 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is the assumed inflation rate plus the expected real rate of return 
this process effectively sets the expected return for the plan s portfolio at the yield for the reference bond portfolio  adjusted for expected risk premiums of the target asset portfolio 
given the prospective nature of this calculation  short term fluctuations in the market do not impact the expected risk premiums 
however  as the yield for the reference bonds fluctuates  the assumed inflation rate and the expected long term rate are adjusted in tandem 
the following illustrates the impact of changes in individual assumptions without changing any other assumption on expenses in a basis point increase in the pension discount rate would have decreased pension expense by approximately  while a basis point decrease in the pension discount rate would have increased pension expense by approximately  a basis point increase in the pension long term expected rate of return would have decreased pension expense by approximately  while a basis point decrease in the pension long term expected rate of return would have increased pension expense by approximately  a basis point increase in the opeb discount rate would have decreased opeb expense by approximately  while a basis point decrease in the opeb discount rate would have increased opeb expense by approximately  and a basis point increase in the opeb long term expected rate of return would have decreased opeb expense by approximately  while a basis point decrease in the opeb long term expected rate of return would have increased opeb expense by approximately

higher amortization of dac  increased other benefits and claims and debt extinguishment costs partially offset the overall improvement 
the increase in interest spread income was driven by the corporate and other and individual investments segments 
within corporate and other  higher interest spread income was due to increased invested asset levels primarily as a result of higher excess capital and surplus retained in the corporate and other segment and improved earnings from common stock and real estate investments 
the increase in interest spread income within the individual investments segment primarily resulted from a higher level of invested assets and lower crediting rates 

table of contents the increase in other income primarily was attributable to the retirement plans segment due to higher asset based fees from improving equity markets  revenue earned by ria  which was acquired during the first quarter of  and growth in trust and administration only products 
the company recorded net realized gains on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items during compared to net realized losses in primarily due to a significant decline in impairment charges 
asset fees rose primarily due to increases in both average separate account values and the average asset fee rate charged in the individual investments segment 
higher amortization of dac primarily occurred within the individual investments segment due to increased variable annuity revenues 
fixed annuity true ups and unlocking also contributed to the increase 
the increase in other benefits and claims primarily was driven by an increase in immediate annuity business and growth in contracts containing guaranteed living benefits within the individual investments segment 
additionally  individual protection benefits and claims increased primarily as a result of increased insurance in force and a corresponding net amount at risk 
during the third quarter of  the company paid million to redeem all of its outstanding junior subordinated debentures due october   which in turn caused the redemption by nationwide financial services capital trust ii of its outstanding trust preferred securities and trust common securities 
as a result of this transaction  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs of million for accelerated amortization of unamortized debt issuance costs  including a deferred loss on previous hedging transactions 
these amounts otherwise would have been recognized through also during the third quarter of  the company refined its separate account drd estimation process 
as a result  the company identified and recorded additional federal income tax benefits and recoverables in the amount of million related to all open tax years 
in addition  the company recorded million of net benefit adjustments in the third quarter of  primarily related to differences between the estimated tax liability and the amounts reported on the company s tax returns and revised estimates of permanent income tax deductions expected to be generated in during the fourth quarter of  the company revised the estimate for the separate account drd and recorded an additional federal income tax benefit of million based on additional information available at year end 
therefore  the full year effective tax rate of was lower than the rate of primarily due to the additional drd recorded in compared to

higher other operating expenses and amortization of dac partially offset the overall increase 
higher asset fees were due to changes in the market value of the investment options underlying the account values  which followed the general upward trends of the equity markets 
the increase in interest spread income primarily occurred in the individual investments segment and was due to higher income from mortgage loan prepayment penalties and bond call premiums along with increased average account values 
other income increased due to more private sector retirement plans being sold through ntc and increased activity related to securitizations and structured products 

table of contents the decline in net realized losses on investments  hedging instruments and hedged items was driven by an improving market and credit environment and the impact of market pricing and portfolio alignment 
other than temporary and other investment impairments were positively impacted by the improved credit environment 
other benefits and claims decreased primarily due to lower gmdb benefits driven by improved equity markets and favorable mortality in the individual protection segment 
the increase in other operating expenses reflects higher advertising and promotion and employee compensation and benefits expenses 
higher amortization of dac primarily was attributable to the individual investments segment due to higher gross margins on the underlying business 
the effective tax rate for was compared to in the increase was due to permanent items that grew at a lower rate than pre tax earnings 
the increase in the permanent tax deductions was due to the release of the phase iii tax liability driven by changes in the tax law enacted in  partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance for a consolidated subsidiary  while the separate account drd remained fairly constant 
sales the company regularly monitors and reports a production volume metric titled sales 
sales or similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of the volume of new and renewal business generated in a period 
sales are not derived from any specific gaap income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with gaap  including sales as it relates to non insurance companies 
additionally  the company s definition of sales may differ from that used by other companies 
as used in the insurance industry  sales  or similarly titled measures  generate customer funds managed and administered  which ultimately drive revenues 
as calculated and analyzed by management  statutory premiums and deposits on individual and group annuities and life insurance products calculated in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities and deposits on administration only group retirement plans and the advisory services program are adjusted as described below to arrive at sales 
life insurance premiums determined on a gaap basis are significantly different than statutory premiums and deposits 
life insurance premiums determined on a gaap basis are recognized as revenue when due  as calculated on an accrual basis in proportion to the service provided and performance rendered under the contract 
in addition  many life insurance and annuity products involve an initial deposit or a series of deposits from customers 
these deposits are accounted for as such on a gaap basis and therefore are not reflected in the gaap income statement 
on a statutory basis  life insurance premiums collected cash basis and deposits received cash basis are aggregated and reported as revenues in the line item statutory premiums and annuity considerations 
sales  as reported by the company  are stated net of internal replacements  which management believes provides a more meaningful disclosure of production in a given period 
in addition  the company s definition of sales excludes funding agreements issued under the company s mtn program  asset transfers associated with large case boli and large case retirement plan acquisitions  and deposits into nationwide employee and agent benefit plans 
although these products contribute to asset and earnings growth  their production flows potentially can mask trends in the underlying business and thus do not provide meaningful comparisons and analyses 
management believes that the presentation of sales as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company s business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to differences between the timing of sales and revenue recognition 

table of contents the company s flagship products are marketed under the best of america brand and include individual variable and group annuities  group private sector retirement plans sold through ntc and variable life insurance 
the best of america products allow customers to choose from investment options managed by premier mutual fund managers

private sector sales increases continue to be driven by additional production through the independent broker dealers and financial institutions channels and growth at the k company primarily due to flows associated with the addition of four large plans during the fourth quarter of the increase in public sector sales was due to growth in large cases  including the state of new york  the state of california  the state of maryland  the state of florida and the city of phoenix plans 
growth in the state of new york plan occurred due to increased participation at the state level  along with increased adoption of the state s plan by smaller entities  which added large numbers of eligible participants 
the increased sales in the state of california and the city of phoenix plans primarily were due to higher plan transfers

also contributing to the increase were higher capitalization of certain software charges related to a systems consolidation project with an increase in the amounts eligible to be capitalized and additional mutual fund expense reimbursements from increased separate account values 
the decrease in amortization of dac was attributable to a true up in the universal life business related to favorable mortality experience 
the increase in cost of insurance charges reflects a growing block of investment and universal life business with increased insurance in force 
the aging of the block generally tends to increase the cost of insurance charged 
life insurance premiums decreased due to the expected decline of the nfn closed block  lower fixed life sales and the impact of changes in reinsurance coverage from yearly renewable term to coinsurance in the traditional life portfolio

amortization of dac decreased due to the implementation of investment life business dac model enhancements  which provide a more refined calculation and more timely reflections of observed trends in the underlying assumptions 
however  dac amortization increased in the fixed life business  consistent with higher earnings 
the increase in sales was due to continued strength in sales of traditional universal life insurance and coli products 
the traditional universal life sales increase was driven by a re tooled universal life insurance product portfolio and expanding distribution relationships in the non affiliated distribution channels 
the increase in coli sales was driven by higher renewal premiums from the funding of existing coli cases due to continued improvement in the equity market environment and increased participant deferrals in existing executive deferred compensation plans

the company s capital structure consists of long term debt and shareholders equity 
the following table summarizes the company s capital structure as of december in millions long term debt shareholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income total shareholders equity total capital nfs is a holding company whose principal assets are the common stock of nlic and nlica 
the principal sources of funds for nfs to pay interest  dividends and operating expenses are existing cash and investments and dividends from nlic  nlica and other subsidiaries 
see part i  item business regulation regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance companies for a description of nlic and nlica dividend limitations 
nfs currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends in order for nfs to have the necessary funds available to meet its obligations 
a primary liquidity concern with respect to annuity and life insurance products is the risk of early policyholder withdrawal 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by offering variable products where the 
table of contents investment risk is transferred to the policyholder  charging surrender fees at the time of withdrawal for certain products  applying a market value adjustment to withdrawals for certain products in the company s general account  and monitoring and matching anticipated cash inflows and outflows 
for individual annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge is generally calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and is assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
for group annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge amounts and periods can vary significantly  depending on the terms of each contract and the compensation structure for the producer 
generally  surrender charge percentages for group products are less than individual products because the company incurs lower expenses at contract origination for group products 
in addition  over ninety percent of the general account group annuity reserves are subject to a market value adjustment at withdrawal 
life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity products because policyholders generally must undergo a new underwriting process and may incur a surrender fee in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the company are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the company reviews its short term and long term projected sources and uses of funds and the asset liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
the company periodically makes adjustments to its investment policies to reflect changes in short term and long term cash needs and changing business and economic conditions

no contractual provisions exist that could create  accelerate or materially increase those obligations presented 
primarily related to investments in low income housing tax credit partnerships 
call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific 
the date specific requirement mandates the company fund a specified amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement 
the event specific requirement is such that the company is obligated to fund a specified amount of its capital commitment when all the properties in a fund become fully stabilized 
the ultimate call date of these commitments may extend beyond one year but have been reflected in payments due in less than one year due to the call features 
the company s capital typically is called within one to four years  depending on when the events contemplated in the documents transpire 
a significant portion of policy contract benefits and claims to be paid do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any ultimate payment obligation 
amounts reported herein represent estimated undiscounted cash flows out of the company s general account related to death  surrender  annuity and other benefit payments under policy contracts in force at december  separate account payments are not reflected herein due to the matched nature of these obligations and the fact that the contract owners maintain the investment risk of such deposits 
estimated payment amounts reported herein were developed based on review of historical results experienced by the company and the related contractual provisions 
significant assumptions incorporated in the reported amounts include future policy lapse rates including the impact of customer decisions to make future premium payments to keep the related policies in force  coverage levels remaining unchanged from those provided under contracts in force at december   future interest crediting rates  and the estimated timing of payments 
actual amounts will vary  potentially in a significant manner  from the amounts indicated due to deviations between assumptions and actual results and the addition of new business in future periods 
contractual provisions exist which could adjust the amount and or timing of those obligations reported 
key assumptions related to payments due by period include customer lapse and withdrawal rates including timing of death  exchanges to and from the fixed and separate accounts of the variable annuities  claims experience with respect to variable annuity guarantees  and future interest crediting level 
assumptions for future interest crediting levels have been made based on processes consistent with the company s past practices  which is at the discretion of the company  subject to guaranteed minimum crediting rates in many cases and or subject to contractually obligated increases for specified periods of time 
many of the contracts with potentially accelerated timing of payments are subject to surrender charges which are generally calculated as a percentage of deposits made and are assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
amounts disclosed herein include an estimate of those accelerated payments  net of applicable surrender charges

health reserves represent less than million of the amounts reflected in the table and are reflected in the less than one year column 
certain assumptions have been made about mortality experience and retirement patterns in the amounts reported 
actual deaths and retirements may differ significantly from those projected  which could cause the timing of the obligations reported to vary significantly 
in addition  contractual surrender provisions exist on an immaterial portion of these contracts that could accelerate those obligations presented 
the amounts disclosed herein do not include an estimate of those accelerated payments 
most of the contracts with potentially accelerated timing of payments are subject to surrender charges which are generally calculated as a percentage of the commuted value of the remaining term certain benefit payments and are assessed at declining rates during the first seven policy years

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive financial instruments the company is subject to potential fluctuations in earnings and the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities  as well as variations in expected cash flows due to changes in market interest rates and equity prices 
the following discussion focuses on specific interest rate  foreign currency and equity price risks to which the company is exposed and describes strategies used to manage these risks 
the discussion is limited to financial instruments subject to market risks and is not intended to be a complete discussion of all of the risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates can impact the company s earnings  cash flows and the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be required to reinvest the proceeds from maturing and prepaying investments at rates lower than the overall yield of the portfolio  which could reduce future interest spread income 
in addition  minimum guaranteed crediting rates ranging from to for a majority of the individual annuity contracts in force on certain individual annuity contracts could prevent the company from lowering its interest crediting rates to levels commensurate with prevailing market interest rates  resulting in a reduction to the company s interest spread income in the event market interest rates remain at  or decline further from  december  levels 
the average crediting rate of fixed annuity products during was and for the individual investments and retirement plans segments  respectively compared to and  respectively  during  well in excess of the guaranteed rates 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to be consistent with those of the liabilities 
in recent periods  management has taken actions to address low interest rate environments and the resulting impact on interest spread margins  including reducing commissions on fixed annuity sales  launching new products with new guaranteed rates  discontinuing the sale of its leading annual reset fixed annuities and invoking contractual provisions that limit the amount of variable annuity deposits allocated to the guaranteed fixed option 
in addition  the company adheres to a strict discipline of setting interest crediting rates on new business at levels adequate to provide returns consistent with management expectations 
conversely  a rising interest rate environment could result in a reduction in interest spread income or an increase in policyholder surrenders 
existing general account investments supporting annuity liabilities had a weighted average maturity of approximately years as of december  therefore  the change in yield of the portfolio will lag changes in market interest rates 
this lag increases if the rate of prepayments of securities slows 
to the extent the company sets renewal rates based on current market rates  this will result in reduced interest spreads 
alternatively  if the company sets renewal crediting rates while attempting to maintain a desired spread from the portfolio yield  the rates offered by the company may be less than new money rates offered by competitors 
this difference could result in an increase in surrender activity by policyholders 
if the company was unable to fund surrenders with its cash flow from operations  the company might need to sell assets  which likely would have declined in value due to the increase in interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by offering products that assess surrender charges and or market value adjustments at the time of surrender  and by managing the maturity and interest rate sensitivities of the assets to approximate those of the liabilities 
asset liability management strategies to manage interest rate risk the company employs an asset liability management approach tailored to the specific requirements of each of its products 
each line of business has an investment policy based on its specific characteristics 
the policy establishes asset maturity and duration  quality and other relevant guidelines 
an underlying pool or pools of investments  including combinations of common and dedicated asset pools  supports each general account line of business 
the common asset pools are generally maintained on the basis of 
table of contents the desired maturity characteristics of the assets used eg  to years average weighted life 
the various lines of business are given ownership percentages of assets acquired by the pools depending on their contribution to the amounts purchased in the pools  in a manner analogous to investment year allocations 
this methodology is sometimes referred to as synthetic segmentation 
additionally  dedicated pools of assets have been created for certain liabilities or groups of liabilities within most lines 
these pools consist of whole assets purchased specifically for the underlying line of business 
in general  assets placed in any given portfolio remain there until they mature or are called  but active management of specific securities  sectors  and several top down risks may result in portfolio turnover or transfers among the various portfolios 
investment strategies are executed by dedicated investment professionals based on the guidance established for the various pools 
to assist them in this regard  they receive periodic projections of investment needs from each line s management team 
line of business management teams  investment portfolio managers and finance professionals periodically evaluate how well assets purchased and the underlying portfolio match the underlying liabilities for each line 
strategy adjustments are made when needed 
using this information  in conjunction with each line s investment strategy  actual asset purchases or commitments are made 
in addition  plans for future asset purchases are formulated when appropriate 
this process is repeated frequently enough so that invested assets for each line match its investment needs as closely as possible 
the primary objectives are to ensure that each line s liabilities are invested in accordance with its investment strategy and that over or under investment is minimized 
as part of this process  the investment portfolio managers provide each line s actuaries with forecasts of anticipated rates that the line s future investments are expected to produce 
this information  in combination with yields attributable to the line s current investments and its investment rollovers  gives the line actuaries data to use in computing and declaring interest crediting rates for their lines of business in conjunction with management approval 
there are two approaches to developing investment policies for liabilities where cash flows are not interest sensitive and the credited rate is fixed eg  immediate annuities  the company manages risk with a combination cash matching duration matching strategy 
duration is a measure of the sensitivity of price to changes in interest rates 
for a rate movement of basis points  the fair value of liabilities with a duration of years would change by approximately 
for this type of liability  the company generally targets an asset liability duration mismatch of to years 
in addition  the company attempts to minimize asset and liability cash flow mismatches  especially over the first five years 
however  the desired degree of cash matching is balanced against the cost of cash matching 
for liabilities where the company has the right to modify the credited rate and policyholders also have options  the company s risk management process includes modeling both the assets and liabilities over multiple stochastic scenarios 
the company considers a range of potential policyholder behavior as well as the specific liability crediting strategy 
this analysis  combined with appropriate risk tolerances  drives the company s investment policy 
use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk the company periodically purchases fixed rate investments to back variable rate liabilities 
as a result  the company can be exposed to interest rate risk due to the mismatch between variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets 
to mitigate this risk  the company enters into various types of derivative instruments to minimize this mismatch  with fluctuations in the fair values of the derivatives offsetting changes in the fair values of the investments resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company principally uses pay fixed receive variable interest rate swaps to manage this risk 

table of contents under these interest rate swaps  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed rate payments 
the fixed interest paid on the swap offsets the fixed interest received on the investment  resulting in the company receiving the variable interest payments on the swap  generally month us libor  and the credit spread on the investment 
the net receipt of a variable rate will then match the variable rate paid on the liability 
as a result of entering into commercial mortgage loan and private placement commitments  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of such commitments due to changes in interest rates during the commitment period prior to the loans being funded 
to manage this risk  the company enters into short us treasury futures during the commitment period 
with short us treasury futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures will offset the change in fair value of the commitment attributable to the change in interest rates 
the company periodically purchases variable rate investments ie  commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds 
as a result  the company can be exposed to variability in cash flows and investment income due to changes in interest rates 
such variability poses risks to the company when the assets are funded with fixed rate liabilities 
to manage this risk  the company may enter into receive fixed pay variable interest rate swaps 
in using these interest rate swaps  the company receives fixed interest rate payments and makes variable rate payments 
the variable interest paid on the swap offsets the variable interest received on the investment  resulting in the company receiving the fixed interest payments on the swap and the credit spread on the investment 
the net receipt of a fixed rate will then match the fixed rate paid on the liability 
the company manages interest rate risk at the segment level 
different segments may simultaneously hedge interest rate risks associated with owning fixed and variable rate investments considering the risk relevant to a particular segment 
foreign currency risk management in conjunction with the company s mtn program  the company periodically issues both fixed and variable rate liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in fair value of the liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and related interest rates 
to manage these risks  the company enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to convert these liabilities to a us dollar rate 
the company is exposed to changes in fair value of fixed rate investments denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and related interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company uses cross currency interest rate hedges to swap these asset characteristics to variable us dollar rate instruments 
cross currency interest rate swaps on assets are structured to pay a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and receive a variable us dollar rate  generally month us libor 
these derivative instruments are designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed rate foreign denominated asset 
for a variable rate foreign liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a variable rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month us libor 
as both sides of the cross currency interest rate swap are variable  the derivative instrument is a basis swap 
while the receive side terms of the cross currency interest rate swap will line up with the terms of the liability  the company is not able to match the pay side terms of the derivative to a specific asset 
therefore  these derivative instruments do not receive hedge accounting treatment 
cross currency interest rate swaps on variable rate investments are structured to pay a variable rate  in the foreign currency  and receive a fixed us dollar rate 
the terms of the foreign currency paid on the swap will exactly match the terms of the foreign currency received on the asset  thus eliminating currency risk 
these derivative instruments are designated as a cash flow hedge

corporate bonds and other fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate the maturity year is that of the security or loan 
individual deferred fixed annuities the maturity year is based on the expected date of policyholder withdrawal  taking into account actual experience  current interest rates and contract terms

variable swap rates and settlement prices reflect rates and prices in effect as of december  equity market risk asset fees calculated as a percentage of the separate account assets are a significant source of revenue to the company 
as of december   approximately of separate account assets were invested in equity mutual funds approximately as of december  
gains and losses in the equity markets result in corresponding increases and decreases in the company s separate account assets and asset fee revenue 
in addition  a decrease in separate account assets may decrease the company s expectations of future profit margins due to a decrease in asset fee revenue and or an increase in guaranteed contract claims  which also may require the company to accelerate the amortization of dac 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns is annual growth  earned evenly throughout the year 
if equity markets were unchanged throughout a given year  the company estimates that its net earnings per diluted share  calculated using current weighted average diluted shares outstanding  would be approximately to less than had the company s long term assumption for net separate account returns been realized 
this analysis assumes no other factors change and that an unlocking of dac assumptions would not be required 
however  as it does each quarter  the company would evaluate its dac balance and underlying assumptions to determine whether unlocking is appropriate 
the company can provide no assurance that the experience of flat equity market returns would not result in changes to other factors affecting profitability  including the possibility of unlocking of dac assumptions 
many of the company s individual variable annuity contracts offer gmdb features 
a gmdb generally provides a benefit if the annuitant dies and the contract value is less than a specified amount  which may be based on the premiums paid less amounts withdrawn or contract value on a specified anniversary date 
a decline in the stock market causing the contract value to fall below this specified amount  which varies from contract to contract based on the date the contract was entered into as well as the gmdb feature elected  will increase the net amount at risk  which is the gmdb in excess of the contract value 
this could result in additional gmdb claims 
to mitigate this risk  the company has implemented a gmdb economic hedging program for certain new and existing business 
prior to implementation of the gmdb hedging program in  the company managed this risk primarily by entering into reinsurance arrangements 
the gmdb economic hedging program is designed to offset changes in the economic value of the gmdb obligation up to a return of the contractholder s premium payments 
however  the first of gmdb claims are not hedged 
currently the program shorts s p index futures  which provides an offset to changes in the value of the designated obligation 
the company s economic evaluation of the gmdb obligation is not consistent with current accounting treatment of the gmdb obligation 
therefore  the hedging activity will lead to earnings volatility 
this volatility was negligible in as of december  and  the net amount at risk was billion and billion before reinsurance  respectively  and million and million net of reinsurance  respectively 
as of december  and  the company s reserve for gmdb claims was million and million  respectively 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for discussion of the impact of adopting a new accounting principle regarding gmdb reserves in the company also offers certain variable annuity products with a gmab rider 
a gmab provides the contractholder with a guaranteed return of premium  adjusted proportionately for withdrawals  after a specified period of time  or years selected by the contractholder at the time of issuance of the variable annuity contract 
in some cases  the contractholder also has the option  after a specified period of time  to drop the rider and continue the variable annuity contract without the gmab 
the design of the gmab rider limits the risk to 
table of contents the company in a variety of ways including asset allocation requirements  which serve to reduce the company s potential exposure to underlying fund performance risks 
specifically  the gmab terms limit asset allocation by requiring partial allocation of assets to a guaranteed term option a fixed rate investment option and excluding certain funds that are highly volatile or difficult to hedge  or requiring all assets be allocated to one of the approved asset allocation funds or models defined by the company 
a gmab represents an embedded derivative in the variable annuity contract that is required to be separated from  and valued apart from  the host variable annuity contract 
the embedded derivative is carried at fair value and reported in other future policy benefits and claims 
the company initially records an offset to the fair value of the embedded derivative on the balance sheet  which is amortized through the income statement over the term of the gmab period of the contract 
the fair value of the gmab embedded derivative is calculated based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected benefit cash flows incorporating numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  expectations of contractholder persistency  market returns  correlations of market returns and market return volatility 
the company began selling contracts with the gmab feature on may  beginning october   the company launched an enhanced version of the rider that offered increased equity exposure to the contractholder in return for a higher charge 
the company simultaneously began economically hedging the gmab exposure for those risks that exceed a level it considered acceptable 
the gmab economic hedge consists of shorting interest rate futures and s p index futures contracts and does not qualify for hedge accounting under current guidance 
upon reaching scale  the company anticipates the purchase of s p index put options and over the counter basket put options  which are constructed in order to minimize the tracking error of the hedge and the gmab liability 
see note c to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for discussion of economic hedges 
the objective of the gmab economic hedge strategy is to manage the exposures with risk beyond a level considered acceptable to the company 
the company is exposed to equity market risk related to the gmab feature should the growth in the underlying investments  including any gto investment  fail to reach the guaranteed return level 
the gmab embedded derivative will create volatility in earnings  however  the hedging program provides substantial mitigation of this exposure 
this volatility was negligible in and as of december  and  the fair value of the gmab embedded derivative was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the fair value of the gmab embedded derivative was driven by the value of new business sold during beginning in march  the company began offering a hybrid gmab gmwb through its capital preservation plus lifetime income contract rider 
this living benefit combines a gmab feature in its first years with a lifetime withdrawal benefit which begins upon the maturity of the gmab and extends for the duration of the insured s life 
in the event that the insured s contract value is exhausted through such withdrawals  the company shall continue to fund future withdrawals at a pre defined level until the insured s death 
in some cases  the contract owner has the right to drop the gmwb portion of this rider or periodically reset the guaranteed withdrawal basis to a higher level 
this benefit requires a minimum allocation to guaranteed term options or adherence to limitations required by an approved asset allocation strategy as previously described above 
inflation the rate of inflation did not have a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the company during  or
