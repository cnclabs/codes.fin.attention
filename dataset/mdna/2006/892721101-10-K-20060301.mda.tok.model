the e commerce segment s core business grew organically  primarily driven by an extension in our customer base across the majority of our revenue components  coupled with revenues generated from a prior year acquisition  which accounted for approximately million of the consolidated revenue increase 
supplementing the core e commerce revenue growth was approximately million in revenue earned from our january  hot rocket acquisition 
internet game development and other e commerce revenue is comprised of revenue generated from internet game development and associated royalty revenue of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  with the million  or increase attributable to a successful game introduced in early fiscal  and list management revenue  whereby we allow selected vendors to market their offers to our database in consideration for a share of the revenues earned usually of such revenues which amounted to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  with the million  or increase attributable to a full fiscal deployment of such activity over a wider range of vendors when compared to a partial fiscal deployment over a limited range of vendors

the e commerce segment recognized an increase of million in its media purchases  which included website registrations  customer profiles  search engine costs and all other core on line customer procurement costs 
we have adjusted our marketing emphasis to be more reliant on revenue generation resulting from search traffic media  and  accordingly  incurred approximately million on such marketing expenditures during fiscal  as compared to million in similar expenditures during fiscal during the period january  to november   cost of revenue also included approximately million in direct purchases of on line advertising space  which is resold on a performance basis by our hot rocket subsidiary  which was acquired on january  fiscal did not have a comparable cost

index to financial statements the e commerce segment increase in the cost of sales further resulted from an increase of million  or increase  in email marketing costs which includes certain operating costs necessary to handle the email operations of our infiknowledge subsidiary to promote the segment s revenue generating opportunities directly related to email promotions and to cause potential as well as repeat customers to visit and re visit in the case of repeat customers our websites  and  once there  to register and become customer profiles available to be marketed existing offers  and future promotions  currently and in future fiscal periods 
see consolidated gross profit  by segment for a discussion of anticipated future gross margin recognition as a result of current period costs incurred 
the cost of sales related to our lec billed product segment declined approximately million  or  when compared to the prior year 
lec costs are principally comprised of billing  collection and customer service costs 
we terminated our marketing efforts and expenditures during fiscal regarding acquisition of new lec customers  which is the reason for the comparative period decline in lec billed product segment cost of revenues

the decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to three factors the impact on gross margin from significant increases in search engine marketing expenditures and other third party online customer costs for our websites  with all such costs being charged to operations when incurred  with such outlays generating revenue in current and future fiscal periods 
furthermore margin earned on search generated media is less than that which was generated from our sweepstakes based media 
search generated media occupied approximately of our total fiscal e commerce media spent compared to of our e commerce media spent during fiscal the impact on gross profit from imatchup 
com from our expensing of customer acquisition costs during the period we acquire a free imatchup 
com membership account  while the recognition of the revenue is dependent upon whether or not the free account converts to a paying membership 
the period that a free account may convert to a billable account ranges from one week after acquisition  to as long as two years  after its initial month of acquisition  based on available historical conversion to billable experience 
the costs of acquiring free memberships has risen in fiscal approximately three fold  and that conversion rates regarding first time conversion and renewal billing retention have both declined during fiscal  with both factors having a negative impact on the future growth potential and the future fiscal period profit generating potential of our dating sites 
we believe that the primary cause for the cost increase results from the market conditions regarding competition  where our competitors continue to increase the cost that they accept to pay for new member data 
the impact on gross margin  although to a lesser degree than and above  resulting from our shift in resource allocation in response to regulatory changes  whereby we migrated a portion of our marketing efforts from higher margin email revenue to lower margin search traffic generated revenue 
email revenue increased million  or in fiscal  but comprised only of fiscal consolidated revenues compared to of fiscal consolidated revenues

com dating sites results from the expensing of the costs of customer acquisition during the period we acquire and expense the free imatchup 
com membership account  while the recognition of the revenue is dependent upon whether or not the free account converts to a paying membership 
the period that a free account may convert to a billable account ranges from one week after acquisition  to as long as two years  and longer  after its initial month of acquisition  based on available historical conversion to billable experience 
therefore  predicated on stabilized acquisition costs in future fiscal periods  we expect that the future conversions of free membership acquisitions to billable members  as well as the anticipated renewal revenues from such acquired customers  should allow us to report improved gross profit margins attributable to such memberships in our e commerce segment in future fiscal periods

cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended november   compared to approximately million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended november   representing an approximate million decrease in cash provided by operating activities

and and fr issued in december  referencing the commission s statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices  we have set forth below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on our company s results of operations and cash flows  if general business conditions or individual customer financial circumstances change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any forward looking statements contained herewith 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to reserves for uncollectible receivables  reserves for data qualification allowances  recoverability of long lived assets  and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states  both at the federal level and various state levels  as well as the foreign jurisdiction of canada 
in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and the recording of the related deferred tax assets and liabilities  and currently payable tax liabilities  we are required to use significant and material levels of judgment that involve many transactions and calculations 
as such  the ultimate determination of our tax is uncertain  and we provide for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as a result of the application of sfas no 
 we at times establish reserves for the potential of additional income tax based on our best estimate of the potential for the probable loss of certain tax positions taken on our tax returns 
we believe that our combined tax accruals and tax reserves are adequate for all tax years open to audit 
all tax accruals and tax reserves are treated as current liabilities in their balance sheet presentation 
additionally  we have potential exposure resulting from pending and or threatened litigation for which we currently assess immaterial risk and  accordingly  do not provide for loss 
additionally  no provision for loss has been recorded for the potential of currently unknown actions naming us as defendant in future fiscal periods 
actual results could differ from our estimates

index to financial statements factors that could effect future results historically high levels of volatility in revenue and cost trends our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied 
our revenues  cost of providing revenues  profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among segments  as well as on a consolidated basis 
the revenue allocation among our segments in future periods will most probably be different than our current revenue allocation due to several factors  including consumer tastes  business opportunities  regulatory issues that may exist in future periods  and other currently unknown factors that could impact our revenue generating cycle or cost structure 
therefore  it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends  and their corresponding impact on liquidity and capital resources 
actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis  which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations 
historically  we have been able to rapidly react to changes in the business environment within which we operate 
management responds to these changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change  and as dictated by the nature of such changes 
management s reaction to such changes could cover a broad range of business related adjustments  ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions  to entire business model overhauls 
based on our current operations and marketing methods  as well as the dynamic  ever changing status of the internet marketing environment  it is conceivable that we would institute changes to our business practices in future fiscal periods 
there can be no assurance that any such potential change would be successful in its implementation  and there can be no assurance that any such implementation would benefit our operating margins  profitability  cash flows or capital resources 
revenue recognition  variable costs and bad debts we currently earn the most significant portion of our revenue from the e commerce segment pursuant to marketing agreements with marketing partners and corporate customers 
the provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded 
we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement 
revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered  or service is provided  net of estimated contractually specified data qualification allowances  when applicable 
such data qualification allowances may include duplications  invalid addresses  and age restrictions  and are recorded as contra revenue 
our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual allowances vary from amounts previously estimated 
historically  the variance between actual allowances and previously estimated allowances has been immaterial 
if events were to occur that would cause actual allowances which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue  as contra revenues  in arriving at reported net revenue to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability  cash flows and capital resources could be adversely affected 
certain revenue related obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
they include costs payable to other on line  as well as off line  media companies for generating registered users and consumer data for us  database fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements  email message delivery costs  contingent based prize indemnification coverage ie  sweepstakes payout indemnification  estimated premium fulfillment costs related to the respective promotion if applicable and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized 
our actual premium fulfillment estimates have varied from that which were accrued at the time of recording the related revenue 
this is deemed a change in management s estimate  and we take the additional cost  or benefit  on the accrual adjustment in the fiscal period that the variance is determinable
