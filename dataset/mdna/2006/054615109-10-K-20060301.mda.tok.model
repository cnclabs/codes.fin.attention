we received all of the net proceeds from the offering after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions 
gross proceeds from the stock offering were million 
after underwriting discounts and commissions  we received million 
we utilized million to repay all of the amounts outstanding under our credit facility  including accrued interest and fees  and thousand to pay expenses related to the stock offering  and we used the remaining million for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
significant customers raytheon company  an aerospace and defense systems supplier  represented of our net sales in  in and in while raytheon  a prime contractor with the us government  does constitute a significant portion of our business  we do not currently believe that this is at risk business 
backlog and orders axsys recognized  in  bookings of million  ending the year with record backlog of million  of which will be shipped beyond months 
our backlog increased by million  or  compared to our ending backlog of million as of december  as we look forward  we expect continued growth in the optical systems group  which is supported by the segment s backlog of million at the end of this group will continue to target orders that require highly precise optical and motion control solutions 
examples include surveillance  military navigation and targeting  smart weapons  and medical imaging 
acquisition of diversified optical products  inc on may   we acquired all of the stock of diop  a manufacturer of high end thermal camera systems and lenses  for million in cash plus million of legal  audit and other acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition 
the acquisition of diop brought us new  high value technologies  leveraged our existing infrared and motion control technologies  and provided us with a new base of customers 
further  the combination of diop and axsys positioned us as a leading independent infrared lens manufacturer 
at the time of the acquisition  diop employed approximately people at its salem  new hampshire headquarters 
diop is doing business as axsys technologies ir systems and the financial results are included in our optical systems group s results 
in connection with the acquisition of diop  on may   we also entered into a new million credit facility with fleet bank 
the credit facility consisted of a five year term loan a in the amount of million  a two year term loan b in the amount of million and a three year revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million 
borrowings under this credit facility provided a portion of the consideration used to acquire diop 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  we used the net proceeds from the stock offering to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the term loan b 
in addition to repaying term loan b  we also repaid in full the amounts outstanding under the term loan a with the net proceeds of the stock offering 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
acquisition of telic optics  inc on april   we acquired all of the stock of telic  a manufacturer of infrared optical products 
the financial results of telic are included in our optical systems group s results 
telic s broad infrared optics capabilities increase our product offerings and complement our strong position in reflective optical solutions 
in addition  telic s products are typically used in ground and sea based programs 
this complements our historical focus on air and space based programs and expands our overall market and program penetration 
finally  the complementary addition of telic s technical capabilities to our core technical strengths is expected to increase our competitive advantage by broadening our technical offering to prime contractors who are seeking to outsource the fulfillment of their optical requirements 
the initial purchase price of this acquisition  after a working capital adjustment of thousand  was million with an additional earn out payment of up to million over months following the closing date based on the achievement of certain revenue goals 
during  million of the earn out was earned  which increased the purchase price to million 
this additional earn out payment will be paid during if remaining revenue goals are achieved  over the next months the earn out could increase the total purchase price to million 
included in the purchase price was thousand of legal  audit and other acquisition related expenses that were incurred in connection with the acquisition 
we funded the purchase price and associated transaction costs through a combination of existing cash balances and outside bank financing 
james webb space telescope during  we received an million definitive contract from ball aerospace and technology corporation to produce the optical mirror substrates for the james webb space telescope  or jwst 
the contract contains million of production sales and million for facilitization 
we recognized revenue of million during and million during under the percentage of completion method of accounting related to the jwst project 
the jwst  which is currently expected to launch in  will replace the hubble as nasa s premier space telescope 
northrop grumman is the prime contractor 
the primary mirror is comprised of individual lightweight beryllium segments  all of which will be fabricated by axsys 
because of the large size of the primary mirror  jwst will be significantly more sensitive than ground based infrared telescopes  enabling it to search for the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe billions of years ago 
our contract includes the production of optical substrates for an engineering development unit  primary mirror segments and support structures 
we expect to deliver all segments by the end of results of segment operations the following tables and discussion set forth selected financial information from continuing operations on a segment basis for the years ended december   and the segment tables  shown below  exclude one time charges  which are shown separately 
optical systems group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the optical systems group segment increased for the year ended december  compared to  while sales in this segment increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase in sales was largely due to the acquisition of diop  which brought us new  high value technologies  leveraged our existing infrared and motion control technologies  and provided us with a new base of customers 
we also benefited from strong military spending on surveillance and targeting programs  particularly those using our infrared imaging and motion control technology 
during  we recognized increased revenues year over year from the jwst contract under the percentage of completion method of accounting compared  the first year of production 
lastly  sales of our scanners  which are used in medical imaging and graphic art applications  were comparable to revenues and slightly higher than gross profit as a percent of sales for the year ended december  increased compared to and mainly due to increased volume  sales mix and improved efficiencies in comparison to the past two years 
our recent acquisitions over the past two years have had a favorable impact on the sales mix resulting in higher than historical margins 
the optical systems group  as of december   had a backlog of definitive orders of million  of which is expected to ship beyond the fiscal year 
distributed products group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit sales in the distributed products group for the year ended december  were comparable to sales and higher than sales 
revenues remained consistent despite increased pricing pressures and competition 
in  the distributed products group experienced a number of delays from various large customers  contributing to a record backlog of million 
revenues were higher in and compared to as a result of increased sales in the industrial automation and consumer goods markets as well as a general increase in new customer activities 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased in compared to the prior two years primarily as a result of competitive pricing pressures and increased anti duty dumping costs 
operating expenses table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  were million in compared to million in and million in the spending increase  year over year  on a dollar basis  was primarily due to the acquisition of diop and the incremental expenses associated with a full year of expense for telic compared to nine months of expense in diop incurred million of sg a in  while telic incurred an additional thousand of sg a as a result of a full year of operation 
in addition  we experienced increased spending for audit and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
amortization expense totaled thousand in as compared to thousand in and in despite the overall increase in sg a as a percentage of sales  sg a was lower than in the prior years primarily due to higher sales volume and continued efforts to control costs 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased by million compared to primarily as a result of the newly acquired infrared product line 
this product line is research intensive as we continuously make improvements on products  which are sold to end users 
our legacy product lines are primarily manufactured and sold to oems based on their unique design specifications 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense was million in the year ended december   compared to thousand in and thousand in the increase in expense in compared to and is primarily due to interest on our million term loan  which we incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of diop  which was partially offset by lower interest paid on capital leases compared to and interest income 
interest income was thousand in the year ended december  compared to thousand in and thousand in interest income was primarily composed of income from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in conjunction with our prepayment of the principal and accrued interest on the million term loan a and the million term loan b during  we incurred a charge of thousand for the write off of loan origination fees and a charge of thousand for the early termination of the related interest rate swap agreement 
other income and expense  net 
net other income in was thousand compared to net other expense of thousand in and net other income of thousand in in  other income and expense was composed primarily of the effects of foreign exchange gains and losses 
income taxes 
the consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in and in the effective rates for and were impacted by the reversal of a valuation allowance 
in accordance with the sfas no 
 we established a million valuation allowance against our deferred income tax asset in as we reported income  we reduced the valuation allowance and utilized million in and million in as deferred income tax assets were realized 
a valuation allowance is not currently required as it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized in the future 
discontinued operations 
in  we incurred an after tax charge of thousand from the settlement of the prospect  connecticut environmental claim related to a previously divested operation 
as of december   we have no further responsibility to the epa as it relates to this site 
during  we incurred an after tax charge of thousand related to the divestiture of our automation group 
in  we believed that we would be able to sublease two facilities formerly occupied by our divested businesses 
however  we had not been able to locate tenants for these facilities 
the lease on one facility was negotiated and final settlement was paid in february the other lease will expire in and the additional charge is sufficient to cover the remaining lease obligations 
in addition  during we recognized an after tax charge thousand for an environmental related expense for previously divested operations 
net income 
we had net income of million or per diluted share in  net income of million or per diluted share in and net income of million or per diluted share in in addition  we issued  shares of common stock through a public stock offering in september  which impacted earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily from cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
we have maintained a high level of liquidity as evidenced by our current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities  which was as of december  and as of december  gross proceeds from the stock offering were million 
after underwriting discounts and commissions  we received million 
we utilized million to repay the amounts outstanding under the term loans of the credit facility entered into in may in connection with the acquisition of diop  as described below  including accrued interest and fees  thousand to pay expenses related to the stock offering  and we used the remaining million for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we completed the acquisition of diop on may  the purchase price was million in cash  plus million of acquisition related costs 
in connection with the acquisition of diop  we entered into a new credit facility on may  with fleet bank 
the new credit facility provided for a three year million revolving line of credit  a five year term loan a in the principal amount of million and a two year term loan b in the principal amount of million 
the amounts outstanding under the term loan a and term loan b were paid in full on september  with the net proceeds from the stock offering 
the million revolving credit facility remains available through may  subject to optional prepayment in accordance with its terms 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be utilized to issue letters of credit 
we may elect to have any borrowing under the revolving credit facility bear interest either at the bank s prime rate or the libor rate plus a margin of to basis points  depending on our consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
we have the option of selecting the month  month  month or month libor rate 
on december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  as of december   million of the revolving credit facility was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
repayments of amounts borrowed under the revolver are secured by a lien on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  including a pledge of the stock of all of our subsidiaries and is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
net cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization  million decrease in our net deferred income tax asset and thousand of stock to partially fund the company k plan 
in addition  we spent thousand on discontinued operations primarily for leases and environmental clean up activities 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our inventories  which resulted from long lead time orders and increased sales from our optical systems group 
we also utilized thousand of cash to fund an increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of unbilled receivables generated by service contracts and excess of cost over billings on percentage of completion accounting 
additional cash outflows of thousand were primarily for the utilization of loss contract reserves  legal and consulting costs associated with environmental activities and the reduction of deferred income as we completed some long lead time orders 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income plus non cash expenses  which primarily consists of million of depreciation and amortization and a thousand non cash charge related to the modification of stock option grants for a terminated employee 
these non cash charges were partially offset by non cash benefits  including a million increase in our net deferred income tax assets  due to the utilization and reversal of a valuation allowance for these assets 
we also paid out thousand for liabilities related to discontinued operations  which was offset by an additional accrual for discontinued operations of thousand 
in  we utilized million of cash to fund changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we used million of cash to fund an increase in our accounts receivable  which resulted from sales growth and higher deferred income billings in our optical solutions group 
we also utilized million to fund inventory growth in the inventory growth was related to certain large long term programs in our optical systems group 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
the increase in deferred income was the result of our strategy to actively negotiate progress payments into certain large dollar contracts for long lead time products and long term programs 
this strategy helps to mitigate the near term negative cash impact of these contracts 
the net change in accrued expenses and other liabilities and other long term liabilities was a thousand increase 
the increase was related to increased accruals for compensation related expenses and an accrual for capital equipment that was received but not invoiced  which were partially offset by the liquidation of an inactive pension plan and the utilization of the reserve for loss contracts 
during  we also received a thousand federal income tax refund and a thousand decrease in current assets primarily due to the timing of insurance payments 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income  million of depreciation and a million federal income tax refund 
the income tax refund was partially offset by a thousand income tax receivable that was recognized in one of our primary uses of cash was inventory  which grew million in the inventory growth was related to certain large programs in our optical systems group 
the cash outflows for inventory were almost entirely offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
in  we reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities and long term liabilities by thousand 
this was primarily due to the utilization of reserves for loss contracts and restructuring 
in addition  we utilized million to fund obligations related to our discontinued operations 
in  we signed a definitive agreement to purchase a  square foot building in new hampshire for million 
this facility will become the new consolidated manufacturing facility for our axsys technologies ir systems division 
additionally in  we expect to spend between and million on capital equipment 
the majority of this capital investment will be used to purchase production and testing equipment  which will expand our capacity and improve our efficiency 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in we utilized million to acquire diop in and million to acquire telic in the purchase of telic was partially funded by the sale of million of short term investment securities 
in addition  capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in  capital was primarily used to purchase machinery and equipment used in manufacturing 
the additional capital used in was for the construction of a  square foot  climate controlled manufacturing facility in cullman  alabama 
the additional space is being used to produce the beryllium mirror substrates and support structures for an engineering development unit  optical mirror segments and two spare units and support structures that comprise the meter primary mirror as well as the secondary mirror for jwst 
during  we invested million in short term investment securities 
the funds were invested in short term investment securities in order to minimize interest rate risk and to allow for rapid redeployment when profitable long term investment or expansion opportunities were identified 
in  we also invested million in capital equipment 
financing activities provided million of cash in and million in and used million of cash in during  we borrowed million to purchase diop and paid off million of financing related to the acquisition of telic in april in addition  we completed a public stock offering of  shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds of million during the third quarter of in  we made a million principal payment and utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the public stock offering to prepay the remaining million outstanding on our credit facility 
during  we also received million in proceeds from the exercise of options and paid off the remaining thousand of capital lease obligations 
during  we obtained a million term loan for the acquisition of telic and received thousand in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these sources of funds were partially offset by repayments of thousand on the term loan and thousand on our capital leases 
in  funds were used to retire five of our capital leases with the highest interest rates before their maturity date 
the prepayment penalties on these leases had expired  which enabled us to achieve a modest interest rate savings 
during  we also paid thousand to settle litigation regarding our preferred stock  which was liquidated in with our existing cash balance  anticipated cash flows from operations and the million revolving credit facility  management believes that the company has sufficient liquidity to finance its operations  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
shareholder s equity was million  or per common share outstanding  at december  compared to million  or per common share outstanding  at december  the increase in shareholders equity was due primarily to the public stock offering and net income of million 
most of the remaining increase in shareholders equity was related to the exercise of stock options and stock option compensation 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated single purpose entities 
contracts and commitments we have entered into certain contractual obligations  which will result in material cash outlays over the next several years 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for capital leases  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total as of december   axsys had operating lease commitments for all of our facilities  with the exception of our cullman  alabama facility  which is owned 
in addition  our operating lease commitments included leases on some office equipment 
as of december   we had various purchase obligations  which include long distance phone service  atm lines and other commitments 
incorporated in other long term obligations are commitments related to environmental remediation plans and building leases associated with discontinued operations 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at three sites  which include one site that is in the final stage of monitoring 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of december   we determined that it was probable that we would incur approximately thousand of remediation and monitoring costs  of which thousand is included in current liabilities and thousand is in other long term liabilities 
during  we disposed of the automation group  which included facilities in wilmington  massachusetts and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
as part of the terms of the sale  we remain obligated under the operating leases for these facilities 
the pittsburgh lease was renegotiated and final settlement was made in february the wilmington lease expires in and we anticipate our remaining commitment to be thousand 
since  we have been sub leasing a small portion of our wilmington facility  however  given the uncertainties regarding the real estate market in this region  we do not believe that we will be able to sublease the entire wilmington facility at our contractual rates 
therefore  we have fully reserved for our remaining lease commitments for the facility and any remaining costs associated with this site will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
as of december   we were contingently liable for million under outstanding letters of credit 
we have issued letters of credit for certain business transactions including insurance programs and building lease security deposits 
as of december   we had one pension plan for which benefits and participation have been frozen 
pension benefits under this plan are generally based upon years of service and compensation 
the plan is an unfunded plan with an annual payout of approximately thousand 
in  we signed a agreement to purchase a  square foot building in new hampshire for million 
this facility will become the new consolidated manufacturing facility for our axsys technologies ir systems division 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  contingencies  bad debts  warranties  environmental remediation efforts and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture or distribute products  which are either components or subassemblies that are sold to other manufacturers or oems 
we do not sell any finished products directly to consumers 
therefore  we are generally not responsible for any installation or customer training 
however  some of our contracts are subject to customer acceptance and generally the customer will inspect and accept the product at our facility prior to shipment 
generally  legal title passes to the customer upon shipment 
however  occasionally product is shipped fob destination 
when the product is shipped fob destination  revenues are not recognized until the customer receives the product 
our policy is to recognize revenues when a product is either shipped to or received by the customer based on the terms of the specific sale 
however  certain long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion model 
revenues and estimated gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials and overhead 
these contracts require judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
contract changes are included when the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we may receive progress payments that exceed costs incurred on these long term contracts 
such advances are recognized as billings in excess of costs and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income primarily results form the advance billings to our customers for the cost of beryllium  known as material only billings 
these material only billings are deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue only when the associated finished product is shipped 
certain contracts are accounted for under the service contract model 
under these contracts  revenues are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
due to the build to order nature of our products  except for the distribution of ball bearings and the manufacture of infrared cameras  we do not offer price protection and generally do not offer discounts 
to the extent discounts are offered  they are reflected at the time of the sale as a reduction in revenues 
the price is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order 
when customer change orders occur  any pricing changes are reflected in a revised purchase order 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over ninety days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish an allowance based on experience and discussion with customers 
historically  our estimated allowance has approximated actual write offs 
however  actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
accounts receivable are written off only when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our markets are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine our inventory to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
historically  our estimate of inventory reserves has approximated actual results 
loss contract reserves 
generally  our customer contracts are completed within one year of receiving the order 
however  occasionally  longer lead time orders are received and we monitor these contracts periodically to determine if our actual costs are comparable to our cost estimates used at the time of order acceptance 
if we determine that our actual costs are significantly exceeding our original estimates  we will record a loss contract reserve 
currently  one contract is covered by a loss contract reserve 
we accrued for this contract based on the contract price and the current cost structure  including estimated cost increases 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in two environmental remediation projects and one site that is in the final stage of monitoring 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for cleanup is determined and costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when costs are not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated  no accrual is made 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
although our estimates to date have proven to be accurate  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based on an analysis of historical data and is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity and frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results from operations could be impacted 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not more than likely  we are required to establish a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period  we are required to include this amount as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of the taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than january  early adoption is permitted 
we expect to adopt the statement effective january   as required 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the annual impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in the stock based compensation accounting policy note included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for axsys fiscal year the company does not believe that adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on its overall results of operations or financial position 
cautionary factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act  including  without limitation  statements regarding our ability to reduce design and manufacturing lead times and manufacturing costs  our ability to integrate existing technologies  our ability to implement our strategy to develop and sell  among other things  higher level sub systems  the changes to be achieved from our cost reduction efforts  our objective to grow through strategic acquisitions and anticipated expenditures for environmental remediation 
one can identify these forward looking statements by the use of the words such as expect  anticipate  plan  may  will  estimate or other similar expressions
