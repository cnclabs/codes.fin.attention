we are the third largest integrated energy company in the united states  based on market capitalization 
we have approximately  employees worldwide  and at year end had assets of billion 
our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cop 
our business is organized into six operating segments exploration and production e p this segment primarily explores for  produces and markets crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis 
midstream this segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by conocophillips and others  and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids  primarily in the united states  canada and trinidad 
the midstream segment primarily includes our percent equity investment in duke energy field services  llc defs  a joint venture with duke energy corporation 
refining and marketing r m this segment purchases  refines  markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products  mainly in the united states  europe and asia 
lukoil investment this segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares of oao lukoil lukoil  an international  integrated oil and gas company headquartered in russia 
our investment was percent at december  chemicals this segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis 
the chemicals segment consists of our percent equity investment in chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem  a joint venture with chevron corporation 
emerging businesses this segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations  including new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products eg  gas to liquids  technology solutions  power generation  and emerging technologies 
crude oil and natural gas prices  along with refining margins  play the most significant roles in our profitability 
accordingly  our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our e p and r m segments 
crude oil and natural gas prices  along with refining margins  are driven by market factors over which we have no control 
however  from a competitive perspective  there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful  including adding to our proved reserve base 
we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways successful exploration and development of new fields 
acquisition of existing fields 
applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields 
through a combination of all three methods listed above  we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base  and we anticipate being able to do so in the future 
in late  we signed an agreement with the libyan national oil corporation under which we and our co venturers acquired an ownership interest in the waha concessions in libya 
as a result  we added million barrels to our net proved crude oil reserves in in the three years ending december   our reserve replacement exceeded percent  including the impact of our equity investments 
the replacement rate was primarily attributable to our investment in lukoil  other purchases of reserves in place  and extensions and discoveries 
although it cannot be assured  going forward  we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years 
this expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects and the anticipated additional ownership interest in lukoil 
operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely  consistently and in an environmentally sound manner 
safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations 
maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries  minimizing downtime in producing fields  and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins 
during  our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was percent  compared with percent in the reduced utilization rate reflects the impact of hurricanes on our us refining operations during finally  we strive to conduct our operations in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship 
controlling costs and expenses 
since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell  keeping our operating and overhead costs low  within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship  is a high priority 
we monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly  on both an absolute dollar basis and a per unit basis 
because low operating and overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries  cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs 
selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars 
we participate in capital intensive industries 
as a result  we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields  develop newly discovered fields  maintain existing fields  or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes 
we invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on invested dollars 
however  there are often long lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial returns 
our capital expenditures and investments in totaled billion  and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately billion in  including our expenditures to re enter libya 
the amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in lukoil 
managing our asset portfolio 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices 
we also continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed 
this management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns 
during  we substantially completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger 
also during  we acquired a percent interest in lukoil  a major russian integrated energy company 
during  we increased our investment in lukoil  ending the year with a percent ownership interest 
also during  we entered into an agreement to acquire burlington resources inc  an independent exploration and production company with a substantial position in north american natural gas reserves and production 
the transaction has a preliminary value of billion 
under the terms of the agreement  burlington resources shareholders would receive in cash and shares of conocophillips common stock for each burlington resources share they own 
this transaction is expected to close on march   subject to approval by burlington resources shareholders at a special meeting set for march  hiring  developing and retaining a talented workforce 
we want to attract  train  develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics 
our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow 
these include crude oil and natural gas prices and production  natural gas liquids prices  refining capacity utilization  and refinery output 
other significant factors that can affect our profitability include property and leasehold impairments 
as mentioned above  we participate in capital intensive industries 
at times  these investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised downward  when crude oil or natural gas prices  or refinery margins  decline significantly for long periods of time  or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write down to its fair market value 
property impairments in totaled million  compared with million in we may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks which  if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful  could lead to material impairment of leasehold values 
goodwill 
as a result of mergers and acquisitions  at year end we had billion of goodwill on our balance sheet 
although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required  future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative  though non cash  effect on our profitability 
tax jurisdictions 
as a global company  our operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the mix of earnings within our global operations 
segment analysis the e p segment s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices 
these are commodity products  the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no control 
we benefited from favorable crude oil prices in  which contributed significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment 
industry crude oil prices were approximately per barrel or percent higher in  compared with  averaging per barrel for west texas intermediate 
the increase primarily was due to robust global consumption associated with the continuing global economic recovery  as well as oil supply disruptions in iraq  and disruptions in the us gulf of mexico due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
in addition  there was little excess opec production capacity available to replace lost supplies 
industry us natural gas prices were per million british thermal units mmbtu or percent higher in  compared with  averaging approximately per mmbtu for henry hub 
natural gas prices increased in due primarily to higher oil prices  continued concerns regarding the adequacy of us natural gas supplies  and the hurricanes disrupting production and distribution in the gulf coast region 
looking forward  prices for both crude and natural gas are expected to decrease in from levels  while remaining strong relative to long term historical averages 
the midstream segment s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices 
the most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our percent equity investment in defs 
during  we increased our ownership interest in defs from percent to percent 
during  we recorded a gain of million  after tax  for our equity share of defs sale of its general partnership interest in teppco partners  lp teppco 
refining margins  refinery utilization  cost control  and marketing margins primarily drive the r m segment s results 
refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks  and the sales prices for refined products  which are subject to market factors over which we have no control 
refining margins in were stronger in comparison to  resulting in improved r m profitability 
the us gulf coast light oil spread increased percent  from an average of per barrel in to per barrel in key factors driving the growth in refining margins were healthy growth in demand for refined products in the united states and other countries worldwide  as well as concerns over adequate supplies due to hurricanes katrina and rita damaging refining and distribution infrastructure along the gulf coast 
our marketing margins were lower in  compared with  due to the market s inability to pass through higher crude and product costs 
the lukoil investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of lukoil 
in october  we closed on a transaction to acquire percent of lukoil s shares held by the russian government for approximately billion 
during the remainder of and all of  we acquired additional shares in the open market for an additional billion  bringing our equity ownership interest in lukoil to percent by year end we initiated this strategic investment to gain further exposure to russia s resource potential  where lukoil has significant positions in proved reserves and production 
we also are benefiting from an increase in proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost  and our e p segment should benefit from direct participation with lukoil in large oil projects in the northern timan pechora region of russia  and an opportunity to potentially participate in the development of the west qurna field in iraq 
the chemicals segment consists of our percent interest in cpchem 
the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which cpchem has little or no control 
cpchem is investing in feedstock advantaged areas in the middle east with access to large  growing markets  such as asia 
our financial results from chemicals in were the strongest since the formation of cpchem in  as this business line has emerged from a deep cyclical downturn that began around that time 
the emerging businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal scope of operations 
we do not expect the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results 
however  the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of profitability in future years 
at december   we had a debt to capital ratio of percent  compared with percent at the end of the decrease was due to a billion reduction in debt during  along with increased equity reflecting strong earnings 
upon completion of the burlington resources acquisition  we expect our debt to capital ratio to increase into the low percent range 
however  we expect debt reduction to be a priority after the acquisition  allowing us to move back toward a mid to low percent debt to capital ratio within three years 
results of operations consolidated results a summary of the company s net income loss by business segment follows millions of dollars years ended december exploration and production e p midstream refining and marketing r m lukoil investment chemicals emerging businesses corporate and other net income the improved results in and primarily were due to higher crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our e p and midstream segments

income statement analysis vs 
sales and other operating revenues increased percent in  while purchased crude oil  natural gas and products increased percent 
these increases primarily were due to higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids 
at its september meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  which encompasses our buy sell transactions  and will impact our reported revenues and purchase costs 
the eitf concluded that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty in the same line of business should be recorded net and accounted for as nonmonetary exchanges if they are entered into in contemplation of one another 
the new guidance is effective prospectively beginning april   for new arrangements entered into  and for modifications or renewals of existing arrangements 
had this new guidance been effective for the periods included in this report  and depending on the determination of what transactions are affected by the new guidance  we would have been required to reduce sales and other operating revenues in  and by  million   million and  million  respectively  with related decreases in purchased crude oil  natural gas and products

excludes defs 
the midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems 
the natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream 
the remaining residue gas is marketed to electrical utilities  industrial users  and gas marketing companies 
most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated separated into individual components like ethane  butane and propane and marketed as chemical feedstock  fuel  or blendstock 
the midstream segment consists of our equity investment in duke energy field services  llc defs  as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations  and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses  primarily in the united states and trinidad 
in july  conocophillips and duke energy corporation duke restructured their respective ownership levels in defs  which resulted in defs becoming a jointly controlled venture  owned percent by each company 
prior to the restructuring  our ownership interest in defs was percent 
this restructuring increased our ownership in defs through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain canadian midstream assets from defs to duke  a disproportionate cash distribution from defs to duke from the sale of defs interest in teppco  and a combined payment by conocophillips to duke and defs of approximately million

this estimate is based on market indicators  historical production trends of lukoil  and other factors 
differences between the estimate and actual results are recorded in a subsequent period 
this process may create volatility in quarterly trend analysis for this segment  but this volatility will be mitigated when viewing this segment s results over an annual or longer time frame 
chemicals millions of dollars net income the chemicals segment consists of our percent interest in chevron phillips chemical company llc cpchem  which we account for under the equity method 
cpchem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene  propylene  styrene  benzene  and paraxylene 
these products are then marketed and sold  or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals  such as polyethylene  polystyrene and cyclohexane 
vs 
net income from the chemicals segment increased percent in the increase primarily was attributable to higher margins in the ethylene and polyethylene lines of business 
ethylene margins improved for the second consecutive year and  coupled with the increase in polyethylene margins  indicates that these business lines have improved from a deep cyclical downturn that began in the time frame 
partially offsetting these margin improvements were higher utility costs  reflecting increased costs of natural gas  as well as hurricane related impacts on production and maintenance and repair costs 
vs 
net income from the chemicals segment increased million in  compared with the increase reflects that cpchem had improved equity earnings from qatar chemical company ltd 
q chem  an olefins and polyolefins complex in qatar  and saudi chevron phillips company  an aromatics complex in saudi arabia 
results from cpchem s consolidated operations also improved due to higher ethylene and benzene margins  as well as increased ethylene  polyethylene and normal alpha olefins sales volumes 
emerging businesses millions of dollars net income loss technology solutions gas to liquids power other the emerging businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional operations 
these activities include gas to liquids gtl operations  power generation  technology solutions such as sulfur removal technologies  and emerging technologies  such as renewable fuels and emission management technologies 
vs 
the emerging businesses segment incurred a net loss of million in  compared with a net loss of million in the improved results in reflect the first full year of operations at the immingham power plant in the united kingdom 
the plant commenced commercial operations in the fourth quarter of lower costs in the gas to liquids business  reflecting the shut down in june of a demonstration plant in ponca city  oklahoma 
improved margins in the domestic power generation business 
vs 
emerging businesses incurred a net loss of million in  compared with a net loss of million in contributing to the higher losses in were lower domestic power margins and higher maintenance costs  as well as increased costs associated with the immingham power plant project in the united kingdom  which entered the initial commissioning phase during prior to the initial commissioning phase  most costs associated with this project were construction activities and thus capitalized 
this project completed the initial commissioning phase and began commercial operations in october partially offsetting these items were lower research and development costs  compared with  which included the costs of a demonstration gtl plant then under construction 
construction of the gtl plant was substantially completed during the second quarter of corporate and other millions of dollars net income loss net interest corporate general and administrative expenses discontinued operations merger related costs cumulative effect of accounting changes other includes a million charge related to discontinued operations  primarily related to the adoption of fin r 
vs 
after tax net interest consists of interest and financing expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest  as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt 
net interest decreased percent in  primarily due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income 
interest income increased as a result of our higher average cash balances during these items were partially offset by increased early debt retirement fees and a lower amount of interest being capitalized in  reflecting the completion of several major projects in the second half of after tax corporate general and administrative expenses decreased percent in the decrease reflects increased allocations of management level stock based compensation to the operating segments  which had previously been retained at corporate 
these increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the operating segments results 
this was partially offset by increased charitable contributions  reflecting disaster relief following the southeast asia tsunami and gulf of mexico hurricanes 
discontinued operations net income declined in  reflecting asset dispositions completed during and the category other consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating segments on a stand alone basis  including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses  and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation 
results from other were lower in  mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency transaction impacts 
vs 
net interest decreased percent in  primarily due to lower average debt levels  an increased amount of interest being capitalized in  lower charges for premiums paid on the early retirement of debt  and lower costs associated with the receivables monetization program 
after tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased percent in the increase reflects higher compensation costs  which includes increased stock based compensation due to an increase in both the number of units issued and higher stock prices in the period 
discontinued operations net income declined percent in  reflecting asset dispositions completed during and results from other were lower in  mainly due to the inclusion in the period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits  negative foreign currency transaction impacts  higher environmental costs and increased minority interest expense

to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we look to a variety of funding sources  primarily cash generated from operating activities 
in addition  during we raised million in funds from the sale of assets 
during  available cash was used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program  repay debt  pay dividends and purchase shares of our common stock 
total dividends paid on our common stock in were billion 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million to billion 
in addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales  we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs  as well as our billion universal shelf registration statement  to support our short and long term liquidity requirements 
we anticipate that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through  including our capital spending program and required debt payments 
we anticipate that the cash portion of the pending acquisition of burlington resources inc  approximately billion  will be financed with a combination of short and long term debt and available cash 
for additional information about the acquisition  see note pending acquisition of burlington resources inc  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from through favorable market conditions played a significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities 
excluding the burlington resources acquisition and absent any unusual event during  we expect that market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our operating cash flows  when compared with significant sources of capital operating activities during  cash of  million was provided by operating activities  compared with cash from operations of  million in this percent increase was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations and a positive impact from working capital changes  partly offset by a greater amount of undistributed equity earnings 
income from continuing operations increased  million  compared with  primarily as a result of higher crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquid prices  as well as improved worldwide refining margins 
working capital changes increased cash flow by million when comparing and contributing to the increase in cash flow from working capital changes were higher increases in accounts payable in  resulting from higher commodity prices and increased capital spending 
undistributed equity earnings increased million in over  as a result of higher equity in earnings of affiliates that have not been distributed to owners 
during  cash flow from operations increased  million to  million 
contributing to the improvement  compared with  was an increase in income from continuing operations primarily resulting from higher crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  as well as improved worldwide refining margins 
this benefit was partly offset by a higher retained interest in receivables sold to a qualifying special purpose entity qspe 
for additional information on receivables sold to a qspe  see receivables monetization in the off balance sheet arrangements section 
our cash flows from operating activities for both the short and long term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  as well as refining and marketing margins 
during and  we benefited from historically high crude oil and natural gas prices  as well as strong refining margins 
the sustainability of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have no control 
in addition  the level of our production volumes of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows 
these production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields  field production decline rates  new technologies  operating efficiency  the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success  and the timely and cost effective development of those proved reserves 
we will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of new fields  or by acquisition  and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves 
we have been successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and  although it cannot be assured  anticipate being able to do so in the future 
including the impact of our equity investments and after adjusting our production for assets sold in and early  our boe production has increased in each of the past three years 
going forward  based on our production level of million boe per day  we expect our annual production growth to average in the range of percent to percent over the five year period ending in these projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp up in those years  exclude our canadian syncrude mining operations  and do not include any impact from our pending acquisition of burlington resources inc including the impact of our equity investments  our reserve replacement over the three year period ending december   exceeded percent 
contributing to our success during this three year period were proved reserves added through our investment in lukoil  other purchases of reserves in place  and extensions and discoveries 
although it cannot be assured  going forward  we expect to more than replace our production over the next three year period  through this expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects 
it does not include any impact from our pending acquisition of burlington resources inc as discussed in critical accounting policies  engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise  and therefore  each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs 
in and  revisions increased our reserves  while in  revisions decreased reserves 
it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future 
the net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for percent  percent and percent of our total net additions in  and  respectively 
during these years  we converted  on average  percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at december   we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be approximately percent 
for additional information related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves  see the discussion under the e p section of capital spending 
the anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks  including reservoir performance  operational downtime  finding and development execution  obtaining management  board and third party approval of development projects in a timely manner  regulatory changes  geographical location  market prices  and environmental issues  and therefore  cannot be assured 
asset sales proceeds from asset sales in were million 
following the merger of conoco and phillips in august  we initiated an asset disposition program 
our ultimate target was to raise approximately billion by the end of during  proceeds from asset sales were billion  bringing total proceeds at the end of to approximately billion since the program began 
proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt 
commercial paper and credit facilities during  we replaced our billion four year revolving credit facility that would have expired in october and our billion five year facility that would have expired in october with two new revolving credit facilities totaling billion 
both new facilities expire in october the new facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for the conocophillips billion commercial paper program  the conocophillips qatar funding ltd 
commercial paper program  and could be used to support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to million 
the facilities are broadly syndicated among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings 
the credit agreements do contain a cross default provision relating to our  or any of our consolidated subsidiaries  failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of million or more 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december  while the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration  our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins  as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil  natural gas and petroleum product purchases 
our primary funding source for short term working capital needs is the conocophillips billion commercial paper program  a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies limited to euro billion equivalent 
commercial paper maturities are generally limited to days 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program  compared with million of commercial paper outstanding at december  in december  conocophillips qatar funding ltd 
initiated a billion commercial paper program to be used to fund commitments relating to the qatargas project 
at december   commercial paper outstanding under this program was million 
since we had million of commercial paper outstanding and had issued million of letters of credit  we had access to billion in borrowing capacity under the two revolving credit facilities as of december  in addition  our billion cash balance also supported our liquidity position 
at december   moody s investor service had a rating of a on our senior long term debt  and standard and poors rating service and fitch had ratings of a 
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity 
in the event that our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market  we would still be able to access funds under our billion revolving credit facilities 
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the us securities and exchange commission  under which we have available to issue and sell a total of billion of various types of debt and equity securities 
minority interests at december   we had outstanding  million of equity in less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners  including a minority interest of million in ashford energy capital sa the remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to controlled operating joint ventures with minority interest owners 
the largest of these  million  was related to the bayu undan liquefied natural gas project in the timor sea and northern australia 
in december  in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes  conoco and cold spring finance sarl cold spring formed ashford energy capital sa through the contribution of a billion conoco subsidiary promissory note and million cash by cold spring 
through its initial million investment  cold spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three month libor rates  plus percent 
the preferred return at december   was percent 
in  and at each year anniversary thereafter  cold spring may elect to remarket their investment in ashford  and if unsuccessful  could require conocophillips to provide a letter of credit in support of cold spring s investment  or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided  then cause the redemption of their investment in ashford 
should conocophillips credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date  ashford would require a letter of credit to support million of the term loans  as of december   made by ashford to other conocophillips subsidiaries 
if the letter of credit is not obtained within days  cold spring could cause ashford to sell the conocophillips subsidiary notes 
at december   ashford held billion of conocophillips subsidiary notes and million in investments unrelated to conocophillips 
we report cold spring s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date 
other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above  cold spring does not have recourse to our general credit 
off balance sheet arrangements receivables monetization at december   certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a qualifying special purpose entity qspe in a revolving period securitization arrangement 
the arrangement provided for conocophillips to sell  and the qspe to purchase  certain receivables and for the qspe to then issue beneficial interests of up to billion to five bank sponsored entities 
at december   the qspe had issued beneficial interests to the bank sponsored entities of million 
all five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to us 
we have held no ownership interests  nor any variable interests  in any of the bank sponsored entities  which we have not consolidated 
furthermore  except as discussed below  we have not consolidated the qspe because it has met the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of conocophillips 
the receivables transferred to the qspe have met the isolation and other requirements of sfas no 
to be accounted for as sales and have been accounted for accordingly 
by january   all of the beneficial interests held by the bank sponsored entities had matured  therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 the operating results and cash flows of the qspe subsequent to this maturity have been consolidated in our financial statements 
the revolving period securitization arrangement was terminated on august   and at this time  we have no plans to renew the arrangement 
see note sales of receivables  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
preferred securities in  we formed a statutory business trust  phillips capital ii trust ii  with conocophillips owning all of the common securities of the trust 
the sole purpose of the trust was to issue preferred securities to outside investors  investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of conocophillips 
the trust was established to raise funds for general corporate purposes 
at december  and  trust ii had million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities outstanding  whose sole asset was million of conocophillips subordinated debt securities  which bear interest at percent 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by conocophillips on the subordinated debt securities 
we made interest payments of million in both and in addition  we guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities 
when we redeem the subordinated debt securities  trust ii is required to apply all redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities

in march  agreement was reached with the republic of kazakhstan government to conclude the sale of bg international s interest in the north caspian sea production sharing agreement to several of the remaining partners and for the subsequent sale of one half of the acquired interests to kazmunaygas 
this agreement increased our ownership interest from percent to percent 
asia pacific timor sea in the timor sea  we continued with development activities associated with phase i of the bayu undan project  where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed  and the dry gas re injected into the reservoir 
production of liquids began from phase i in february of  and development drilling concluded at the end of march in june  we received approval from the timor sea designated authority for phase ii  the development of an lng plant near darwin  australia  as well as a gas pipeline from bayu undan to the lng facility 
construction activities continued through  and the first lng cargo from the facility was loaded in february indonesia in indonesia  funds were used for the completion of the belanak field in the south natuna sea block b  including the construction of the belanak floating production  storage and offloading fpso facility and associated gas plant facilities on the fpso 
oil production began from belanak in late and first condensate production and gas exports began in june and october  respectively 
also  in block b we began development of the kerisi and hiu fields 
in south sumatra  following the execution of the west java gas sales agreement in august  we began the development of the suban phase ii project  which is an expansion of the existing suban gas plant 
also in south sumatra  we completed the construction of the south jambi shallow gas project in the south jambi b block  where first production began in june china following approval from the chinese government in early  we began development of phase ii of the peng lai oil field  as well as concurrent development of the nearby field 
the development of peng lai and peng lai will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger fpso facility 
vietnam in vietnam s block  funds were invested for the su tu den phase i southwest area development project  where production began in the fourth quarter of and where water injection facilities were put into service in also in block  preliminary engineering for the nearby su tu vang development began in early  and approval for the development was obtained in late on block  we upgraded facilities at our producing rang dong field in and continued further development of the field  including the central part of the field  where two additional platforms and additional production and injection wells were completed in the third quarter of capital budget e p s capital budget is billion  percent higher than actual expenditures in twenty four percent of e p s capital budget is planned for the united states  with percent of that slated for alaska 
we plan to spend million in for our alaskan operations 
a majority of the capital spending will fund prudhoe bay  greater kuparuk and western north slope operations including two alpine satellites and west sak field developments  construction to complete our fifth and final endeavour class tanker  and exploration activities 
in the lower  offshore capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the ursa field and the completion of the k and magnolia developments in deepwater gulf of mexico 
onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas  including the san juan basin of new mexico and the lobo trend of south texas 
e p is directing billion of its capital budget to international projects  including payments for the acquisition of an interest in our former oil and gas production operations in libya 
the agreement for our return was signed and approved by the libyan government in late december in addition  funds in also will be directed to developing major long term projects  including the bayu undan gas development project in the timor sea  the kashagan project in the caspian sea and the nmng joint venture in northern russia  the britannia satellites  ekofisk area growth and alvheim projects in the north sea  the bohai bay project in china  the syncrude expansion  surmont heavy oil and the mackenzie delta gas projects in canada  the belanak  kerisi hiu and suban phase ii projects in indonesia  the corocoro project in venezuela  and the qatargas lng project in qatar 
in late december  we announced that  in conjunction with our co venturers  we reached agreement with the libyan national oil corporation on the terms under which we would return to our former oil and natural gas production operations in the waha concessions in libya 
conocophillips and marathon each hold a percent interest  amerada hess holds an percent interest  and the libyan national oil corporation holds the remaining percent interest 
the fiscal terms of the agreement are similar to the terms in effect at the time of the suspension of the co venturers activities in the terms include a year extension of the concessions to  a payment to the libyan national oil corporation of billion million net to conocophillips for the acquisition of an ownership interest in  and extension of  the concessions  and a contribution to unamortized investments made since of million million net to conocophillips that were agreed to be paid as part of the standstill agreement to hold the assets in escrow for the us based co venturers 
of the total amount to be paid by conocophillips  million was paid in january  and the remaining million is expected to be paid in december proved undeveloped reserves costs incurred for the years ended december    and  relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
during these years  we converted  on average  percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
although it cannot be assured  estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years through are projected to be billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
of our  million boe proved undeveloped reserves at year end  we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three year period ending will be approximately percent 
approximately percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year end were associated with nine major developments and our investment in lukoil 
seven of the major developments are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded  and include the hamaca and petrozuata heavy oil projects in venezuela 
the ekofisk  eldfisk and heidrun fields in the north sea and norwegian sea 
natural gas and crude oil fields in indonesia 
the remaining two major projects  qatargas in qatar and the kashagan field in kazakhstan  will have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production 
midstream capital spending for continuing operations for midstream during the three year period ending december   was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in defs in from percent to percent 
r m capital spending for continuing operations for r m during the three year period ending december   was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards  refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields  and the operating integrity of key processing units  as well as for safety projects 
during this three year period  r m capital spending for continuing operations was billion  representing percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations 
key projects during the three year period included completion of a fluid catalytic cracking fcc unit and an s zorb sulfur removal technology s zorb unit at the ferndale refinery 
a low sulfur gasoline project at the ponca city refinery 
phase i of a low sulfur gasoline project at the wood river refinery 
a new s zorb unit at the lake charles refinery 
a new fcc gasoline hydrotreater at the alliance refinery 
an expansion of capacity in the seaway crude oil pipeline 
integration of a crude unit and coker adjacent to our wood river refinery 
a new hydrotreater at the rodeo facility of our san francisco refinery 
the integration of the crude unit and coker purchased adjacent to our wood river refinery enables the refinery to process additional heavier  lower cost crude oil 
the new diesel hydrotreater at the rodeo facility of our san francisco refinery became operational at the end of march the new diesel hydrotreater provides the capability to produce reformulated california highway diesel over one year ahead of the june deadline 
internationally  we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade and increase the profitability of our existing assets  including a replacement reformer at our humber refinery in the united kingdom 
in november  we announced the planned acquisition of the  barrel per day wilhelmshaven refinery in germany 
the purchase is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of capital budget r m s capital budget is billion  a percent increase over actual spending in domestic spending is expected to consume percent of the r m budget 
we plan to direct about billion of the r m capital budget to domestic refining  of which approximately million is earmarked for clean fuels projects already in progress and about million is for sustaining projects related to reliability  safety and the environment 
in addition  about million is intended for strategic and other investments to increase crude oil capacity  expand conversion capability  improve energy efficiency and increase clean product yield 
our us marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about million 
internationally  we plan to spend approximately billion on our r m operations 
of this amount  about billion is intended for the acquisition of the wilhelmshaven refinery in germany  including the initial expenditures for a deep conversion project and other improvements at the refinery 
the remaining international r m capital budget is for projects to strengthen our existing assets within europe and asia 
emerging businesses capital spending for emerging businesses during the three year period ending december   was primarily for construction of the immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the company s humber refinery in the united kingdom 
the plant began commercial operations in october contingencies legal and tax matters we accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
based on currently available information  we believe that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international  federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry  and refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses 
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include  among others  the federal clean air act  which governs air emissions 
federal clean water act  which governs discharges to water bodies 
federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which imposes liability on generators  transporters  and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur 
federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  storage  and disposal of solid waste 
federal oil pollution act of opa  under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located  and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states 
federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra  which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments 
federal safe drinking water act  which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells 
us department of the interior regulations  which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in us waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations  as well as potential liability for pollution damages 
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application 
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have  or are developing  similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities 
while similar  in some cases these regulations may impose additional  or more stringent  requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards  such as air emission standards  water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations  continue to evolve 
however  environmental laws and regulations  including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change  are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate 
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 
for example  the epa has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel  which become applicable in june in april  the epa proposed a rule regarding emissions from non road diesel engines and limiting non road diesel fuel sulfur content 
the non road rule  as promulgated in june  significantly reduces non road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as we are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non road markets 
additional areas of potential air related impact are the proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs and the kyoto protocol 
in july  the epa promulgated more stringent revisions to the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
since that time  final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation american trucking association  inc et al 
v 
united states environmental protection agency that eventually reached the us supreme court during the fall of in february  the us supreme court remanded this matter  in part  to the epa to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone naaqs 
the epa responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new eight hour naaqs on april  several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule 
depending upon the outcomes of the various challenges  area designations  and the resulting state implementation plans  the revised naaqs could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us 
in recent action  the epa has proposed an even more stringent particulate matter standard and continues to consider increased stringency for ozone requirements as well 
outcomes of the deliberations remain indeterminate 
in  an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement  known as the kyoto protocol  which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations 
the united states has not ratified the treaty codifying the kyoto protocol but may in the future ratify  support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions reduction programs 
other countries where we have interests  or may have interests in the future  have made commitments to the kyoto protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations 
because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern implementation of the kyoto protocol  it currently is not possible to accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the kyoto protocol  but they could be substantial 
the kyoto protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in february we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations 
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents 
remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present conocophillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the united states 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
in addition to other cleanup standards  many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe for both soil and groundwater 
mtbe standards continue to evolve  and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of mtbe contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial 
at rcra permitted facilities  we are required to assess environmental conditions 
if conditions warrant  we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  which is often referred to as superfund  the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us 
over the next decade  we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required  but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years 
longer term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
we  from time to time  receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute 
on occasion  we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us  but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations 
as of december   we reported we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at sites around the united states 
at december   we had resolved five of these sites  reclassified one site  and had received six new notices of potential liability  leaving unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability 
for most superfund sites  our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us  versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties  is relatively low 
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites  other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations  and where they have not  or where potentially responsible parties could not be located  our share of liability has not increased materially 
many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned 
prior to actual cleanup  those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions  apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation 
in some instances  we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability 
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval 
there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant  and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures  neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites  in the aggregate  is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition 
expensed environmental costs were million in and are expected to be about million in and million in capitalized environmental costs were  million in and are expected to be about  million and million in and  respectively 
remediation accruals we accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
these accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except those assumed in a purchase business combination  which we do record on a discounted basis 
many of these liabilities result from cercla  rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct  or once conducted  operations or at sites where conocophillips generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
in the future  we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs  and under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of december  remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site  depending on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties 
therefore  it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 
at december   our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs related to continuing operations of million  compared with  million at december  we expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next years 
notwithstanding any of the foregoing  and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
however  we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
other we have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities  loss carryforwards  and credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized 
uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs 
based on our historical taxable income  our expectations for the future  and available tax planning strategies  management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income

for additional information  see the revenue recognition section of note accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
see note accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for descriptions of our major accounting policies 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
these critical accounting policies are discussed with the audit and finance committee at least annually 
we believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies  along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report  address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information  prior to the discovery of proved reserves  is expensed as incurred  similar to accounting for research and development costs 
however  leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect 
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds  management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date 
for leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small  management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area 
for prospects in areas that have had limited  or no  previous exploratory drilling  the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high 
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost  and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense 
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds  and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively 
by the end of the contractual period of the leasehold  the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned  or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development 
see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties 
at year end  the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs  that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation  was approximately million and the accumulated impairment reserve was approximately million 
the weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was approximately percent and the weighted average amortization period was approximately years 
if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by percent across all calculations  pretax leasehold impairment expense in would increase by million 
the remaining  million of capitalized unproved property costs at year end consisted of individually significant leaseholds  mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership  exploratory wells currently drilling  and suspended exploratory wells 
management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects 
of this amount  approximately billion is concentrated in nine major projects 
except for surmont  which is scheduled to begin production in late  management expects less than million to move to proved properties in most of the remaining value is associated with mackenzie delta  alaska north slope and australia natural gas projects  on which we continue to work with partners and regulatory agencies in order to develop 
see the following discussion of exploratory costs for more information on suspended exploratory wells 
exploratory costs for exploratory wells  drilling costs are temporarily capitalized  or suspended  on the balance sheet  pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well 
if a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense 
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas  the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
the accounting notion of sufficient progress is a judgmental area  but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project s development economically profitable 
in these situations  recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find as a producing well  without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made 
once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed  the economic viability of the overall project  including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that will need to be made  is evaluated 
if economically viable  internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase 
often  the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co venturer approvals  the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control 
exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained 
once all required approvals and permits have been obtained  the projects are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves 
for complex exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field  or we seek government or co venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting 
unlike leasehold acquisition costs  there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs 
in addition to reviewing suspended well balances quarterly  management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term 
criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics and hydrocarbon properties  expected development costs  ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserves  fiscal terms  regulations or contract negotiations  and our required return on investment 
at year end  total suspended well costs were million  compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended wells  see note properties  plants and equipment  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and gas reserves and canadian syncrude reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields and in place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place hydrocarbon volumes  the production or mining plan  historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  accounting rules require disclosure of proved reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s exploration and production e p operations 
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as proved 
our reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines 
we have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates for our e p segment 
proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation 
also  as required by authoritative guidelines  the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date 
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves 
therefore  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
year end estimated reserves related to our lukoil investment segment were based on lukoil s year end oil and gas reserves 
because lukoil s accounting cycle close and preparation of us gaap financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close  our percent equity share of lukoil s oil and gas proved reserves at year end were estimated based on lukoil s prior year s report adjusted for known additions  license extensions  dispositions  and public information and included adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provided for estimated production 
any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent period 
this estimate to actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future period reserves 
the judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset 
at year end  the net book value of productive e p properties  plants and equipment subject to a unit of production calculation  including our canadian syncrude bitumen oil sand assets  was approximately billion and the depreciation  depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in was approximately billion 
the estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves on these fields were billion boe at the beginning of and were billion boe at the end of the estimated proved reserves on the canadian syncrude assets were million barrels at the beginning of and were million barrels at the end of if the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the unit of production calculations had been lower by percent across all calculations  pretax depreciation  depletion and amortization in would have been increased by an estimated million 
impairments of producing oil and gas properties in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
of these write downs  only million in  million in and million in were due to downward revisions of proved reserves 
the remainder of the impairments in resulted either from properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal in of the norway removal grant act that increased asset removal obligations 
impairment of assets long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
if  upon review  the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets  at an entire complex level for downstream assets  or at a site level for retail stores 
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets  the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of review 
see note property impairments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts  permits and regulations  we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites 
our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world  oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska  and asbestos abatement at refineries 
the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset 
estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult 
most of these removal obligations are many years  or decades  in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs 
asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly  as well as political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
in addition  under the above or similar contracts  permits and regulations  we have certain obligations to complete environmental related projects 
these projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at us service stations  and remediation activities required by the state of alaska at exploration and production sites 
future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs  the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required  and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties 
see note accounting policies  note changes in accounting principles  note asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs  and note contingencies and commitments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
business acquisitions purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business 
for most assets and liabilities  purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties  plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
intangible assets and goodwill in connection with the acquisition of tosco corporation on september   and the merger of conoco and phillips on august   we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and trade names  air emission permit credits  and permits to operate refineries 
these intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized 
this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future 
if  due to changes in facts and circumstances  management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives  amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis 
as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives  they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests that require management s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 
see note goodwill and intangibles  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
also  in connection with the acquisition of tosco  the merger of conoco and phillips  and the acquisition of an ownership interest in a producing oil business in libya  we recorded a material amount of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
however  two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
within our e p segment and our r m segment  we determined that we have one and two reporting units  respectively  for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
these are worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
our midstream  chemicals and emerging businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies operations did not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas 
in our e p segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on geographic areas 
all of these geographic areas have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers  and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations 
therefore  all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit  worldwide exploration and production  which is the same as the operating segment 
in contrast  in our r m segment  management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas 
because the two broad functional areas of r m have dissimilar business processes and customers  we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the r m segment level 
instead  we identified two reporting units within the operating segment worldwide refining and worldwide marketing 
components in those two reporting units have similar business processes  distribution networks and customers 
if we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar  the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re assigned using a relative fair value approach in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation 
in addition  the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit s goodwill  based on relative fair values  which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income  and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
in addition  if the first test step is not met  further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation 
again  management must use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
at year end  the estimated fair values of our worldwide exploration and production  worldwide refining  and worldwide marketing reporting units ranged from between percent to percent higher than recorded net book values including goodwill of the reporting units 
however  a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of the billion of goodwill 
during  we expect to acquire burlington resources inc  subject to approval of the transaction by burlington s shareholders and appropriate regulatory agencies 
we expect this acquisition to result in the accounting recognition of a material amount of additional goodwill  all of which will be associated with our worldwide exploration and production reporting unit 
based on our goodwill impairment testing at year end  we anticipate that this reporting unit will have adequate capacity to absorb this additional goodwill from the burlington transaction and will not result in an impairment 
use of equity method accounting for investment in lukoil in october  we purchased percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of lukoil from the russian government 
during the remainder of and throughout  we purchased additional shares of lukoil on the open market and reached an ownership level of percent in lukoil by the end of on january   lukoil held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the lukoil board of directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in russia  and certain amendments to lukoil s charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of major stockholders in lukoil  such as conocophillips 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two companies 
based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in lukoil  we concluded that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of lukoil and thus applied the equity method of accounting beginning in the fourth quarter of determination of whether one company has significant influence over another  the criterion required by apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  in order to use equity method accounting  is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of each situation 
under the equity method of accounting  we estimate and record our weighted average ownership share of lukoil s net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap each period as equity earnings on our income statement  with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in lukoil 
cash dividends received from lukoil will reduce our recorded investment in lukoil 
the use of equity method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures in our report 
if future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant influence over lukoil s operating and financial policies  we would have to change our accounting classification for the investment to an available for sale equity security under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
if that unlikely event were to occur  our investment in lukoil would be marked to market each period  based on lukoil s publicly traded share price  with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
additionally  we would no longer record our ownership share of lukoil s net income each period and any cash dividends would be reported as dividend income when declared by lukoil 
we also would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures 
during  we recorded million of equity method earnings from our percent weighted average ownership level in lukoil 
our reported earnings for the lukoil investment segment of million included the above equity method earnings  less certain expenses and taxes 
at december   we supplementally reported an estimated  million barrels of crude oil and  billion cubic feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of percent at year end because lukoil s accounting cycle close and preparation of us gaap financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close  we have used all available information to estimate lukoil s us gaap net income for the year for purposes of our equity method accounting 
any differences between our estimate of fourth quarter net income and the actual lukoil us gaap net income will be recorded in our equity earnings 
in addition  we used all available information to estimate our share of lukoil s oil and gas disclosures 
if  instead of equity method accounting  we had been required to follow the requirements of sfas no 
for our investment in lukoil  the mark to market adjustment to reflect lukoil s publicly traded share price at year end would have been a pretax benefit to other comprehensive income of approximately  million 
also  million of acquisition related costs would have been expensed and million of current year equity method earnings would not have been recorded 
at the end of  the cost of our investment in lukoil exceeded our percent share of lukoil s historical us gaap balance sheet equity by an estimated  million 
under the accounting guidelines of apb opinion no 
 we account for the basis difference between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of lukoil as if lukoil were a consolidated subsidiary 
in other words  a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine how lukoil assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical push down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in lukoil s shares 
once these hypothetical push down adjustments have been identified  the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference 
the majority of the basis difference is associated with lukoil s developed property  plant and equipment base 
the earnings we recorded for our lukoil investment thus included a reduction for the amortization of this basis difference 
in  we completed the purchase price allocation related to our share purchases of lukoil 
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the required company contributions into the plans 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events  including estimated retirement dates  salary levels at retirement  mortality rates  lump sum election rates  rates of return on plan assets  future health care cost trend rates  and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees 
due to the specialized nature of these calculations  we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations 
for employee retirement income security act qualified pension plans  the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets 
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies  the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects 
ultimately  we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns  but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time 
benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by million  while a percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million 
in determining the discount rate  we use yields on high quality fixed income investments including among other things  moody s aa corporate bond yields with adjustments as needed to match the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans 
outlook on the evening of december   conocophillips and burlington resources inc announced that they had signed a definitive agreement under which conocophillips would acquire burlington resources inc the transaction has a preliminary value of billion 
this transaction is expected to close on march   subject to approval by burlington resources shareholders at a special meeting set for march  under the terms of the agreement  burlington resources shareholders will receive in cash and shares of conocophillips common stock for each burlington resources share they own 
this represents a transaction value of per share  based on the closing of conocophillips shares on friday  december   the last unaffected day of trading prior to the announcement 
we anticipate that the cash portion of the purchase price  approximately billion  will be financed with a combination of short and long term debt and available cash 
burlington resources is an independent exploration and production company that holds a substantial position in north american natural gas reserves and production 
upon completion of the transaction  bobby s 
shakouls  burlington resources president and chief executive officer  and william e 
wade jr  currently an independent director of burlington resources  will join our board of directors 
for additional information about the acquisition  see note pending acquisition of burlington resources inc  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle with the state of alaska on the base fiscal contract terms for an alaskan natural gas pipeline project 
in early  the state of alaska announced that they had reached an agreement in principle with all the co venturers in the project 
once the final form of agreement is reached among all the parties  it will be subject to approval by the alaska state legislature before it can be executed 
additional agreements for the gas to transit canada will also be required 
in february  the governor of alaska announced proposed legislation to change the state s oil and gas production tax structure 
the proposed structure would be based on a percentage of revenues less certain expenditures  and include certain incentives to encourage new investment 
if approved by the legislature  the new tax structure would go into effect july  if enacted  we would anticipate an increase in our production taxes in alaska  based on an initial assessment of the proposed legislation 
in addition to our participation in the lng regasification terminal at freeport  texas  we are pursuing three other proposed lng regasification terminals in the united states 
the beacon port terminal would be located in federal waters in the gulf of mexico  miles south of the louisiana mainland 
also in the gulf of mexico is the proposed compass port terminal  to be located approximately miles offshore alabama 
the third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in the port of long beach  california 
each of these proposed projects is in various stages of the regulatory permitting process 
in the united kingdom  with effect from january   legislation is pending to increase the rate of supplementary corporation tax applicable to uk upstream activity from percent to percent 
this would result in the overall uk upstream corporation tax rate increasing from percent to percent 
the earnings impact of these changes will be reflected in our financial statements when the legislation is substantially enacted  which could occur in the third quarter of upon enactment  we expect to record a charge for the revaluing of the december   deferred tax liability  as well as an adjustment to our tax expense to reflect the new rate from january   through the date of enactment 
we are currently evaluating the full financial impact of this proposed legislation on our financial statements 
in february  the venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime 
the government has published legal instruments supporting the controls  one of which establishes official exchange rates for the us dollar 
the devaluation of the venezuelan currency by approximately percent in march did not have a significant impact on our operations there  however  future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact 
based on public comments by venezuelan government officials  venezuelan legislation could be enacted that would increase the income tax rate on foreign companies operating in the orinoco oil belt from percent to percent 
we continue to work closely with the venezuelan government on any potential impacts to our heavy oil projects in venezuela 
in november  the mackenzie gas project mgp proponents elected to proceed to the regulatory hearings  which began in january this followed an earlier halting of selected data collection  engineering and preliminary contracting work due to insufficient progress on key areas critical to the project 
since that time  considerable progress has been made with respect to canadian government socio economic funding  regulatory process and schedule  the negotiation of benefits and access agreements with four of the five aboriginal groups in the field areas and on the pipeline route 
first production from the parsons lake field is now expected in in december  we signed a statement of intent with qatar petroleum regarding the construction of a gas to liquids gtl plant in ras laffan  qatar 
preliminary engineering and design studies have been completed 
in april  the qatar minister of petroleum stated that there would be a postponement of new gtl projects in order to further study impacts on infrastructure  shipping and contractors  and to ensure that the development of its gas resources occurs at a sustainable rate 
work continues with qatar authorities on the appropriate timing of the project to meet the objectives of qatar and conocophillips 
in r m  the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an important focus area during we expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for to average in the mid nineties 
this projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in lukoil and the pending acquisition of the wilhelmshaven refinery in germany 
also in r m  we are planning to spend billion to billion over the period through to increase our us refining system s ability to process heavy sour crude oil and other lower quality feedstocks 
these investments are expected to incrementally increase refining capacity and clean products yield at our existing facilities  while providing competitive returns

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk we and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
we may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power  natural gas  crude oil and related products  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  or to exploit market opportunities 
our use of derivative instruments is governed by an authority limitations document approved by our board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the chief executive officer 
the authority limitations document also authorizes the chief executive officer to establish the maximum value at risk var limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily 
the chief financial officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  while the executive vice president of commercial monitors commodity price risk 
both report to the chief executive officer 
the commercial organization manages our commercial marketing  optimizes our commodity flows and positions  monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses  and selectively takes price risk to add value 
commodity price risk we operate in the worldwide crude oil  refined products  natural gas  natural gas liquids  and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 
these fluctuations can affect our revenues  as well as the cost of operating  investing  and financing activities 
generally  our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities  however  executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production  as well as refinery margins 
our commercial organization uses futures  forwards  swaps  and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain  which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives balance physical systems 
in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration  exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity  providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand 
meet customer needs 
consist ent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices  we use swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts  which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers  to a floating market price 
manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil  natural gas  refined product and electric power transactions 
 enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business 
for the months ended december  and  the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations 
we use a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued  including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
using monte carlo simulation  a percent confidence level and a one day holding period  the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december  and  was immaterial to our net income and cash flows 
the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december  and  was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows 
interest rate risk the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the carrying amount of our floating rate debt approximates its fair value 
the fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices 
millions of dollars except as indicated debt expected maturity date fixed rate maturity average interest rate floating rate maturity average interest rate year end remaining years total fair value year end remaining years total fair value during the fourth quarter of  we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting billion of debt from fixed to floating rate  but during we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps as we redeemed the associated debt 
this reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to floating by the end of to million 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of million of notes due  million of notes due  and million of notes due these swaps qualify for the shortcut method of hedge accounting  so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge 
interest rate derivatives expected maturity date notional average pay rate average receive rate year end variable to fixed remaining years fixed to variable total fair value position year end variable to fixed fixed to variable fixed to variable remaining years fixed to variable total fair value position foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations 
we do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes  although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk 
examples include firm commitments for capital projects  certain local currency tax payments and dividends  and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year 
at december  and  we held foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between european subsidiaries and a us subsidiary 
although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates  we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by sfas no 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings 
since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower  there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical percent change in the december  or  exchange rates 
the notional and fair market values of these positions at december  and  were as follows millions of dollars foreign currency swaps notional fair market value sell us dollar  buy euro sell us dollar  buy british pound sell us dollar  buy canadian dollar sell us dollar  buy czech koruny sell us dollar  buy danish krone sell us dollar  buy norwegian kroner sell us dollar  buy polish zlotych sell us dollar  buy swedish krona buy us dollar  sell polish zlotych buy euro  sell norwegian kroner buy euro  sell swedish krona for additional information about our use of derivative instruments  see note financial instruments and derivative contracts  in the notes to consolidated financial statements
