item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere herein 
executive summary we provide medical transportation services  which consist primarily of emergency and non emergency medical transportation services  to approximately communities in states 
we provide these medical transportation services under contracts with governmental entities  hospitals  nursing homes and other healthcare facilities and organizations 
as of june   we had approximately exclusive contracts to provide emergency medical transportation services and approximately contracts to provide non emergency medical transportation services and other medical transportation services 
approximately half of our medical transports are initiated by calls  with the remainder primarily consisting of a variety of non emergency medical transports  such as medical transports between hospitals  nursing homes and specialized healthcare facilities 
we believe that providing a mix of emergency and non emergency medical transportation services diversifies our revenue base and permits us to utilize our labor force more efficiently 
we derive revenue based on the level of medical service we provide through reimbursements we receive from commercial insurance companies and government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and  to a lesser extent  from fees paid to us directly by individual patients and from government subsidies paid to us under emergency medical transportation contracts 
medical transportation revenue depends on various factors  including the mix of payers  the mix of rates  the acuity of the patients we transport and the mix of activity between emergency medical transportation services and non emergency transportation services  as well as other competitive and market factors 
the medical transportation portion of our business represented percent of our fiscal net revenue 
we also provide private fire protection and related services  and offer such services on a subscription fee basis to residential and commercial property owners in three states and under long term contracts with fire districts  industrial sites and airports at sites located in states 
our fire protection services consist primarily of fire suppression  fire prevention and first responder medical care and represented percent of our fiscal net revenue 
business overview our strengths we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of industry trends and believe our strong competitive position is attributable to a number of factors  including the following broad presence in attractive markets we operate in geographically diverse markets with favorable demographics 
percent of our net revenues are generated in states with population growth in excess of the national average  such as arizona  florida  oregon  utah and georgia 
a key driver of the rapid population growth in many of the states we serve has been the migration of the elderly seeking to retire or vacation in warmer climates 
as a result  approximately percent of the patients we transported during fiscal were years or older 
this affects us because the elderly require a greater amount of emergency and non emergency medical transports on average than the general population 
competitively well positioned we are a party to approximately contracts granting us the exclusive right to provide emergency medical transportation services for a particular city or county 
we have certificates of need  or the equivalent  in eight 
table of contents states 
in those states that issue them  a certificate of need is required to bid on emergency medical transportation service contracts 
typically  a limited number of certificates of need are granted by a state or county 
our experience has been that obtaining a certificate of need is a significant barrier to entry because a prospective provider of emergency medical services must establish that existing services in a particular area of the state are inadequate to meet the community s medical transportation needs 
we are often able to use the visibility created by our status as the community s emergency medical transportation service provider to win non emergency medical transportation business 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of our local markets due to our emphasis on providing an effective  quality care service model  enhanced by response time reliability and cost efficiencies 
decentralized operating structure with national efficiencies medical transportation and fire protection are locally delivered services  and strong local operations are critical to providing these services successfully 
we grant our regional executives and local operations managers significant authority to make key decisions regarding the day to day operations in our service areas  and consequently  we have built strong  efficient operations at the regional and local levels 
we have combined our local operations with a centralized national platform of shared services  including treasury functions  insurance and safety programs  information services  benefits  purchasing and corporate compliance 
this operating structure has allowed us to optimize cost savings while at the same time maintain effective field operations 
billing and collections capability over the past several years  we began the implementation of a number of initiatives to improve our billing and collections capability 
these initiatives included consolidating our billing operations and streamlining our overall medical transportation billing processes by expediting the timely filing of claims and creating added controls over the day to day flow of aging claims 
additionally  we have improved the quality of data gathering and entry by emergency and non emergency medical transportation personnel to ensure compliance with medical necessity standards set by third party payers 
we have implemented quality assurance controls and procedures for review of claim submissions prior to submitting the claims to third party payers and for following up on any denials of claims by third party payers 
we have also placed a high priority on submitting medical transportation claims electronically in order to expedite payment and maximize the efficiencies afforded by such systems  and we currently submit the majority of our bills electronically 
experienced management team we believe that the disciplined approach of our senior management team has been the key reason for our growth in net revenue and ebitda 
our senior management team is supported by front line division general managers who have an average of years of industry experience and who manage the day to day provision of service in  and our relationships with  the communities we serve 
our management combines extensive knowledge of medical transportation and fire protection services with operations  finance  billing and collections  insurance  risk and safety and federal affairs expertise 
a significant portion of the compensation of our senior management and division general managers comes from an incentive program that ties bonuses to achieving financial and operating goals and other individual objectives established for each participant 
our business strategy our business strategy is to expand our non emergency medical services within existing and contiguous markets  selectively enter into new emergency markets with favorable demographics  invest in technology to improve operating efficiencies and workplace safety and maximize cash flow while providing the highest possible quality of medical transportation  fire protection and related services for the customers and patients we serve 
the key elements of our business strategy are the following 
table of contents expand within existing and contiguous service areas we believe we can maximize our return on the infrastructure we have built in our existing operating areas by continuing to expand the non emergency medical transportation services 
in areas where we are the emergency medical transportation provider  we seek to leverage this visibility to compete for non emergency medical transportation business 
we also seek to expand our emergency medical transportation services in locations that are contiguous to our existing service areas 
this strategy increases the utilization of our work force through balanced growth of emergency and non emergency medical transportation services 
our strategy also enables us to gain operational efficiencies and effectively manage our costs and assets by leveraging our fleet  communications systems and management within our existing service areas 
our efforts contributed to same service area revenue growth in the medical transportation and related service business of percent and percent for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selectively enter new markets we continue to pursue contracts and alliances with municipalities  other governmental entities  hospital based emergency providers and fire districts in select new markets 
among the criteria we set for entering a new market are whether there is an opportunity to provide both emergency and non emergency medical transportation services  geographic proximity to existing operations  expected revenues and margins  payer mix  medical transportation demands  competitive profiles and demographic trends 
during fiscal  we began providing exclusive emergency and non emergency medical transportation services to the cities of salem  oregon  roswell  new mexico and salt lake city  utah 
additionally  we began providing medical transportation services to the orlando regional medical center health system 
invest in technology to improve operating efficiencies we have developed proprietary technology systems to create operating efficiencies and improve the overall quality of service 
in addition  we invest in and utilize technology to improve the performance of operations and utilization of our fleet  including the following specific initiatives proprietary billing system 
we have developed a proprietary medical transportation billing and collections system which is operated from a single  nationwide platform that allows for standardized procedures and training  thereby minimizing duplication and maximizing collections 
this information technology is designed to improve our ability to collect outstanding claims on a timely basis 
rural metro electronic patient care reporting system r m epcr 
our r m epcr technology initiative is designed to enhance and expedite the process of capturing clinical patient data  transferring the data to our proprietary billing system and submitting claims for reimbursement of our medical transportation services 
upon implementation  electronic patient care reports will replace paper patient care reports and provide ambulance crews with clinical flow charts to fully document each patient assessment and procedure performed 
internet based scheduling software 
in an effort to minimize unscheduled overtime among field personnel  we implemented internet based scheduling software designed to maximize efficiencies in crew staffing 
we believe this software has resulted in an overall reduction of labor costs 
drivecam technology 
in an effort to reduce insurance costs and improve safety  we have begun installing on board monitoring systems in our ambulances 
these systems monitor operator performance against safe driving standards 
we expect that this technology will be installed in the majority of our fleet by the end of calendar year improve workplace health and safety and reduce insurance costs we have consistently placed workplace health and safety among our highest priorities due  in part  to escalating insurance costs 
our management  risk management and quality assurance staffs conduct risk management 
table of contents programs for quality assurance  loss prevention and early intervention 
we believe in creating a culture among our work force that encourages and demonstrates a committed approach to workplace health and safety 
over the past several years  we have implemented a variety of safety initiatives that support this commitment  including enhanced facility audits  additional accident reporting guidelines  introduction of an employee risk management hotline and an in depth loss data report that can be utilized by regional managers to identify trends in their areas 
we have developed an extensive claims database that we use to manage our business and identify risks and trends  thereby allowing us to focus our programs and training on identifying and minimizing risk exposure 
we actively promote early reporting  evaluation and resolution of incidents that may evolve into claims 
maximize cash collections we continue to focus on maximizing cash collections by improving billing practices  implementing or negotiating rate increases to meet the escalating costs of delivering high quality services and seeking subsidies to further support the level of medical services we provide 
operating statistics in evaluating our business  we monitor a number of key operating and financial statistics including net net ems average patient charge  net net ems apc  average days sales outstanding dso  see further discussion in results of operations  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  see further discussion in liquidity and capital resources and medical transport volume see further discussion in results of operations  among others 
the following is a summary of certain key operating statistics ebitda in thousands years ended june  net net ems apc dso ebitda medical transports net net ems apc is defined as gross medical transport revenue less provisions for discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payers and doubtful accounts divided by emergency and non emergency transports from continuing operations 
dso is calculated using the average accounts receivable balance on a rolling month basis and net revenue on a rolling month basis and has not been adjusted to eliminate discontinued operations 
see discussion of ebitda along with a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities at liquidity and capital resources ebitda 
medical transports from continuing operations are defined as actual emergency and non emergency patient transports 
factors affecting operating results fiscal results reflect our continued focus on growing and strengthening core operations 
we continued emphasis on expanding service areas that we have identified for future long term growth  seeking targeted new contract opportunities and improving operating efficiencies 
we have observed the following trends and events that have affected or are likely to affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
transport volume we depend on requests for emergency and non emergency medical transportation services to support our primary source of revenue 
increases or decreases in transport volume are influenced by a number of factors 
these 
table of contents factors include population growth  a change in the demographics of the communities we serve for example  aging of the overall population  and seasonal or one time factors that may affect the number of people requiring medical transportation 
our transport volume is affected by entry into new markets and exit of discontinued markets or non renewed contracts 
the strength and number of our non emergency medical transportation competitors in any given service area also affects our ability to expand market share in that location 
provision for doubtful accounts when we contract with municipal  county or other governing authorities as an exclusive provider of emergency medical transportation services  we are required to provide services to their citizens regardless of the ability or willingness of patients to pay 
while we make every attempt to negotiate subsidies to support the level of medical services we provide  not all authorities will agree to provide such subsidies 
as a result  we incur bad debt in the normal course of providing medical transportation services 
our methodology for reserving for bad debt expense is based on a standardized procedure that includes periodic reviews of subsequent historical receipts to determine actual historical collection percentages 
these percentages are used to determine current anticipated collection percentages  which are applied to gross revenue in order to calculate net revenue and the provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts can be affected by a variety of factors  including the following the number of patients we transport that do not pay us for the medical services we provide  rate increases applied to certain insurance payers may not be realized by us with respect to certain patients that require our medical services  a sustained disruption in collections  and  the quality of our billing documentation and procedures 
work force management our business strategy focuses on optimizing the deployment of our work force in order to meet contracted response times and otherwise maintain high levels of quality care and customer service 
a key measure is our ability to efficiently and effectively manage labor resources and enhance operating results 
several factors may influence our labor management efforts  including market specific shortages of qualified paramedics and emergency medical technicians  which affect temporary wages 
we also may experience increases in overtime and training wages due to growth in transport volume related to new contracts  expansion in existing markets and seasonal transport demand patterns 
insurance programs throughout fiscal we have continued to close worker s compensation and general liability claims 
we have also worked to minimize future insurance related losses through proactive risk management and work place safety initiatives 
these programs include the implementation of drivecam technology in the ambulance fleet  ergonomic safety programs designed to reduce on the job injuries and complementary return to work  fit for duty  and wellness programs 
see the insurance section of liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our insurance programs 
contract activity new contracts we were awarded several new contracts during fiscal  including the five year contract for exclusive emergency and non emergency medical transportation services to the city of salem  oregon  which became effective july   
table of contents two year contract as the exclusive emergency and non emergency medical transportation services provider for the city of roswell  new mexico and surrounding chaves county on july   three year contract as the non emergency medical transportation services provider for the orlando regional healthcare system  one of central florida s largest healthcare providers that commenced september   and  four year exclusive contract to provide emergency medical transportation services in salt lake city  utah 
which commenced on april  these four new contracts generated combined annual net revenue totaling million during fiscal contract renewals we were awarded various contract renewals awarded throughout our operations during fiscal including the two year renewal of our long standing contract as the medical transportation services provider in aurora  colorado  five year renewal of our contract to provide medical transportation services in blount county  tennessee  three year extension to continue as the exclusive emergency medical transportation provider in knox county  tennessee  five year renewal contract to continue providing exclusive emergency and non emergency ambulance services in louden county  tennessee  four year contract renewal to continue as the exclusive provider of emergency ambulance services in youngstown  ohio  and two year option renewal to continue to provide exclusive emergency medical transportation services in the city of rochester  new york 
these contracts generated combined net revenue totaling approximately million during fiscal contract non renewals in an effort to strengthen our base of core operations  we regularly perform financial reviews of contracts for profitability 
based upon such a review  we made a strategic decision to exit our augusta  georgia emergency medical services contract upon its expiration on december  this contract generated approximately million and million in net revenue and income from discontinued operations  respectively  during fiscal  the last full year of its operations 
income loss from discontinued operations excludes the allocation of certain shared services costs such as human resources  financial services  risk management and legal services  among others 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we were not selected in a competitive bidding process to continue as the emergency medical transportation provider to the city of scottsdale  arizona 
our contract ended on february   however  due to our continuing involvement in the city of scottsdale s non emergency medical transportation services market and our role as the back up emergency medical transportation provider  this service area remains a continuing operation 
this contract generated approximately million and million in net revenue and operating loss  respectively  during fiscal  the last full year of its operations 
our exclusive emergency medical services contract with the city of chandler  arizona expired on december  prior to the expiration  we were notified by the chandler city council that it had voted to continue our services in approximately half of the city 
this contract  in its entirety  generated approximately million and million in net revenue and income from continuing operations  respectively  during fiscal  the last full year of its operations 
as a result of this change  we have re deployed certain of our emergency medical transportation resources to expand our non emergency medical transportation market share

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated overview the following table sets forth a comparison of certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal and the comparison includes the line items expressed as a percentage of net revenue as well as the dollar value and percentage change in each line item in thousands  except per share amounts years ended june  of net revenue of net revenue change change net revenue operating expenses payroll and employee benefits provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization other operating expenses gain loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income loss on early extinguishment of debt income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income income per share basic income from continuing operations applicable to common stock income loss from discontinued operations applicable to common stock net income diluted income from continuing operations applicable to common stock income loss from discontinued operations applicable to common stock net income average number of common shares outstanding basic average number of common shares outstanding diluted variances over not displayed 

table of contents net revenue growth of million  or percent  resulted from a million  or percent increase in medical transportation and related services revenue and a million  or percent increase in fire and other services revenue 
as a percentage of net revenue  operating expenses were basis points lower in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to a basis point decrease in payroll and employee benefits and a basis point decrease in other operating expenses  both as a percentage of net revenue  partially offset by a basis point increase in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue 
these fluctuations are described in further detail below 
income from continuing operations per diluted share of for fiscal includes an increase in the average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period from million shares at june  to million shares at june  due to common shares issued as a result of stock option exercises 
net revenue the following table shows a comparison of consolidated net revenue by business in thousands years ended june  change change medical transportation and related services fire and other services total net revenue medical transportation and related services same service area revenue accounted for million of the increase in medical transportation and related services revenue while the remaining million resulted from revenues generated under new contracts in tacoma  washington  salem  oregon  roswell  new mexico  salt lake city  utah and the orlando regional healthcare system 
approximately million of the increase in same service area revenue related to increased rates and the balance of million was due to increased transports 
a comparison of transports is included in the table below years ended june  transport change change medical transportation alternative transportation total transports from continuing operations medical transports in areas that we served in both fiscal and increased by approximately  transports as a result of an overall aging population  increase in population density where we have significant operations and increased patient travel between specialized treatment health care facilities 
medical transports related to new contracts totaled approximately  for fiscal the percent increase in transports for our alternative transportation services business can be directly attributed to growth in our non emergency medical transportation business 
consolidated net net ems apc for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the percent increase in net net ems apc is primarily a result of rate escalators and other general rate increases that are contained or allowed in certain contracts to provide ems services as well as a change in payer mix in select markets 

table of contents discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payers contractual allowances related to continuing operations  which are reflected as a reduction of gross medical transportation revenue  totaled million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
such discounts represented percent and percent of gross medical transportation and alternative transportation fees for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase of basis points is primarily a result of rate increases and a change in payer mix in certain markets 
such rate increases are applicable to commercial insurance and private pay patients 
we are unable to pass on these rate increases to medicare  medicaid and certain other payers 
fire and other services the increase in fire and other services revenue is primarily due to fire subscription revenue growth totaling million  or percent  of which million was related to higher subscription rates and million was related to an increase in the number of subscribers 
additionally  master fire fees increased by million due to increases in various master fire contract rates 
operating expenses payroll and employee benefits the overall increase in payroll and employee benefits is primarily due to greater medical transport activity and general wage rate increases which resulted in higher salary expense of million 
approximately million of this increase related to the impact of new service areas 
these increases were partially offset by a million year over year reduction in workers compensation expense due to improved claims history and continuing overall favorable insurance trends and a million decline in management incentive expense due in part to bonuses of million paid during fiscal associated with our debt refinancing activities 
payroll and employee benefits as a percentage of net revenue decreased from percent to percent primarily due to the reduction in worker s compensation expense and management incentive expense described above 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total net revenue was percent and percent for fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of net medical transportation and related services revenue  the provision was percent and percent for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the provision is primarily a result of rate increases  many of which are not allowable under government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and the related growth in medical transportation revenue across all payer classes 
during the second half of fiscal we experienced a disruption in collections caused by medicare patients transition to medicare advantage ma plans 
we also continue to experience a disruption of collections related to medicaid managed care payers in arizona 
our bad debt reserve methodology is based on a standardized procedure that includes periodic reviews of subsequent historical receipts to determine actual historical collection percentages 
these percentages are used in the determination of current anticipated collection percentages that are applied to gross revenues in calculating net revenue and the provision for doubtful accounts 
in accordance with our provisioning methodology  we recorded additional reserves until such time that subsequent receipts reflect improved collections results 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to higher depreciation expense as a result of increased capital expenditures during fiscal and  partially offset by a million write off of a non compete covenant in the prior year 

table of contents other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses was principally due to a million increase in fuel expense primarily driven by an overall increase in the cost of fuel  higher professional fees of million which include legal expenses related to market share protection efforts in certain markets and a fee related to an amendment of our credit facility  a million increase in contractual service and management fees related to the increased number of transports and increases in other miscellaneous operating expenses  none of which were individually significant 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in general liability insurance costs resulting from favorable historical claims experience in recent years 
gain on sale of assets we recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of real estate located in arizona during the first quarter of fiscal cash proceeds from this transaction totaled million 
interest expense the increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher average effective interest rate including a million increase in non cash interest expense related to the accretion of our percent senior discount notes as well as a million increase in the write off of debt issuance costs associated with unscheduled term loan b principal payments made during fiscal this increase is partially offset by interest savings stemming from the lower average term loan b principal balance 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during fiscal  net proceeds from our march refinancing transaction were used to repay approximately million of existing indebtedness 
in connection therewith  we recorded million of debt extinguishment costs in fiscal these costs included non cash charges of million related to the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the retired debt and million related to unamortized discounts as well as cash redemption premiums of million 
minority interest the change in minority interest expense is due to increased net income in our joint venture with the city of san diego in fiscal as compared to fiscal income was generated in fiscal as a result of rate increases  while the income generated in fiscal was a result of both rate increases and increases in transports 
income tax provision during fiscal  we recorded an million income tax benefit related to continuing operations  of which million was the result of the release of valuation allowances relating to a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards 
this amount was partially offset by state income taxes 
beginning in fiscal  we are primarily recognizing deferred income tax expense  as we utilize net operating loss carryforwards to reduce federal and state taxes currently payable and the associated deferred tax benefits are realized 
as a result  minimal current cash payments are required 
we still maintain a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
the valuation allowance includes million related to capital loss carryforwards  million related to federal net operating loss carryforwards  and million related to state net operating loss carryforwards 
during fiscal  we recorded a million income tax provision related to continuing operations 
this provision includes million of deferred income tax expense  which does not require a current cash payment 

table of contents the deferred income tax expense results primarily from utilization of tax benefits  primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  generated in prior years 
the continuing operations tax provision results in an effective tax rate of percent 
this rate differs from the federal statutory rate of percent as a result of recurring expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  such as certain executive compensation and a portion of non cash interest related to our senior discount notes 
these items increased our effective tax rate by percent additionally  the effective tax rate reflects million of adjustments to prior year tax provisions  which increased the effective tax rate by percent 
the effective income tax rate applicable to continuing operations also includes percent related to state income taxes net of federal benefit 
this is significantly higher than the percent state tax effective rate we expect based on our current operations and structure 
this current year increase in the state tax effective rate relates primarily to management s assessment of the realizability of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of fiscal  we discontinued all medical transportation services provided in the state of new jersey 
we based this decision on the fact that our business primarily consisted of non emergency medical transportation services and the limited future potential to obtain emergency transportation contracts in that specific area 
the financial results of this service area for fiscal and are included in income loss from discontinued operations 
effective december  we ceased operating in the city of augusta  georgia upon expiration of our exclusive contract to provide medical transportation services to that area 
we elected not to pursue renewal of this contract based upon the one year contract term and stipulations that would have been less beneficial to us 
the financial results of this service area for fiscal and are included in income loss from discontinued operations 
additionally  the results of operations for service areas where we have ceased operations during fiscal have been included in income loss from discontinued operations for fiscal for fiscal and  net revenue associated with these discontinued service areas totaled million and million  respectively 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal was million  which includes an income tax benefit of million 
income from discontinued operations for fiscal was million  which includes an income tax provision of million 
the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal included million of closure related costs  primarily severance and lease termination charges  an additional million in provision for doubtful accounts and a million goodwill write off related to the closure of the new jersey operation 
the additional provisions were recorded based upon the company s experience with accounts receivable collections for discontinued operations compared to historical levels 
income loss from discontinued operations excludes the allocation of certain shared services costs such as human resources  financial services  risk management and legal services  among others 
these ongoing services and associated costs will be redirected to support new markets or for the expansion of existing service areas 
during fiscal  we also recorded a charge of million related to an ongoing government investigation into certain of our former operations in the state of texas which is included in loss from discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal segments overview we provide emergency and non emergency medical transportation services  private fire protection services  primarily on a subscription fee basis  and a variety of other services 
we have four regionally based reporting segments which correspond with the manner in which the associated operations are managed and evaluated by our senior management 
these segments comprise operations within the following areas segment states a georgia  new york  northern ohio  pennsylvania b alabama  california fire  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  north dakota  northern florida  new jersey fire  southern florida  southern ohio  tennessee  wisconsin c arizona  new mexico  oregon fire  utah d california medical transportation  central florida  colorado  oregon medical transportation  nebraska  south dakota  washington each reporting segment provides medical transportation services while fire services are predominantly centered in segments b and c 
the accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements have also been followed in the preparation of the accompanying financial information for each reporting segment 
for management purposes  segment profitability is defined as income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  interest  income taxes and minority interests 
additionally  corporate overhead allocations have been included within segment profits 
segment results presented below reflect continuing operations only 
the key drivers that impact net medical transportation revenues include rates charged for such services  payer mix  number of transports and government subsidies 
these factors can vary significantly from market to market and also can change over time 
the main drivers of fire and other revenue are fire subscription rates and the number of subscribers

segment a s net revenue increased primarily as a result of a change in payer mix in 
table of contents certain markets 
the decrease in transports can be attributed to increased competition for non emergency medical transportation services  specifically in our alliance and columbus  ohio markets as well as a decline in hospital patient census 
operating margins improved principally due to effective management of payroll related costs in relation to transport volume  partially offset by higher provisions for doubtful accounts and other operating expenses 
payroll related expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily due to reductions in temporary staffing  health insurance costs and workers compensation expense 
provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue increased from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily due to a change in collection patterns stemming from the consolidation of regional billing locations to syracuse and buffalo  new york 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue grew from percent during fiscal to percent during the fiscal primarily driven by a million increase in general liability insurance costs and a million increase in fuel costs partially offset by declines in other miscellaneous operating costs  none of which were individually significant

higher master fire contract fees and fire subscription rates also contributed to net revenue growth despite a slight decline in the number of fire subscriptions 
the decrease in transports can be attributed to increased competition for non emergency medical transportation services in cincinnati  ohio and lexington  kentucky  as well as a decline in hospital patient census in memphis  tennessee 
operating margins increased due to operational efficiencies  primarily lower other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
payroll related expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily due to a million reduction in workers compensation expense partially offset by higher scheduled overtime  fill in wages and temporary staffing due to market specific shortages of paramedics and emt s 
provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue increased from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily due to a change in collection patterns 
table of contents stemming from the consolidation of regional billing locations to indiana  which disrupted collections  and an increase in private pay patients with lower receivable collectibility in certain sectors of tennessee  florida and indiana 
additionally  this segment experienced a change in billing center management that caused a disruption in collections 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily driven by a million decrease in general liability insurance costs and declines in other miscellaneous operating costs  none of which were individually significant  partially offset by a million increase in fuel costs

approximately million of the increase in same service area net medical transportation revenue was a result of increased rates while the remainder was due to increased transports 
the increase in the number of medical transports was primarily a result of the significant population growth experienced in the states in which segment c operates 
the increase in fire and other services revenue is primarily due to percent growth in the number of fire subscriptions  higher fire subscription rates  increased master fire rates  increased forestry fees and one time hurricane rita relief revenue of million recorded during the second quarter of fiscal the increase in segment c s profit includes a million gain on the sale of real estate located in arizona during the first quarter of fiscal excluding the gain on the sale of real estate  operating margins remained relatively flat during fiscal compared to fiscal payroll related expense as a percentage of net revenue increased basis points  from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal primarily due to the growth in transports which has placed constraints on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel  resulting in increased utilization of overtime and temporary staffing

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that 
table of contents affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  general liability and workers compensation claim reserves and deferred tax asset recoverability 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to understanding our results of operations 
the discussion below is not intended to represent a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
medical transportation and related services revenue recognition medical transportation and related services fees are recognized when services are provided and are recorded net of discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payers 
because of the length of the collection cycle with respect to medical transportation and related services fees  it is necessary to estimate the amount of these discounts at the time revenue is recognized 
the collectibility of these fees is analyzed using historical collection experience within each service area 
using collection data resident in our billing system  we estimate the percentage of gross medical transportation and related services fees that will not be collected and record provisions for both discounts and doubtful accounts 
the portion of the provision allocated to discounts is based on historical write offs relating to such discounts as a percentage of the related gross revenue recognized for each service area 
the ratio is then applied to current period gross medical transportation and related services fees to determine the portion of the provision that will be recorded as a reduction in revenue 
the remaining amount of the provision is classified as provision for doubtful accounts 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect the ultimate collectibility of the current revenue stream  revenue could be overstated or understated 
discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payers related to continuing operations  which are reflected as a reduction of medical transportation and related services revenue  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of gross medical transportation and related services revenue  contractual discounts were percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 
based on the allocation of provisions between discounts and doubtful accounts  a one percent change in our estimated collection percentage would change net revenue by million for fiscal provision for doubtful accounts for medical transportation revenue as discussed above  discounts applicable to medicare  medicaid and other third party payers are recorded as reductions of gross revenue 
we also estimate provisions related to the potential uncollectibility of amounts billed to other payers based on historical collection data and historical write off activity within each service area 
the provision for doubtful accounts can be affected by a variety of factors  including the number of patients we transport that do not pay us for the medical services we provide  a sustained disruption in collections  and  the quality of our billing documentation and procedures 
the provision for doubtful accounts percentage that is applied to gross medical transportation and related services fee revenue is calculated as the difference between the total expected collection percentage less contractual discounts described above 
if historical data used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect the ultimate collectibility of the current revenue stream  the provision for doubtful accounts may be overstated or understated 
the provision for doubtful accounts on medical transportation and related services revenue from continuing operations totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net medical transportation and related services fees was percent  percent and percent for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents based on the allocation of provisions between discounts and doubtful accounts  a one percent change in our estimated collections percentage would change the provision for doubtful accounts by million for fiscal insurance claim reserves in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject to accident  injury and professional liability claims 
additionally  certain of our operational contracts  as well as laws in certain of the areas where we operate  require that specified amounts of insurance coverage be maintained 
in order to minimize the risk of exposure and comply with such legal and contractual requirements  we carry a broad range of insurance policies  including comprehensive general liability  automobile  property damage  professional  workers compensation and other lines of coverage 
we typically renew each of these policies annually and purchase limits of coverage at levels management believes are appropriate  taking into account historical and projected claim trends  reasonable protection of our assets and operations and the economic conditions in the insurance market 
depending upon the specific line of coverage  the total limits of insurance maintained may be achieved through a combination of primary policies  excess policies and self insurance 
we retain certain levels of exposure with respect to our general liability and workers compensation programs and purchase coverage from third party insurers for exposures in excess of those levels 
in addition to expensing premiums and other costs relating to excess coverage  we establish reserves for claims  both reported and incurred but not reported  on a gross basis using currently available information as well as our historical claims experience 
we also recognize a receivable from our insurers for amounts expected to be recovered in excess of our retention 
we periodically evaluate the financial capacity of our insurers to assess the recoverability of the related receivables 
we engage third party administrators tpas to manage claims resulting from our general liability and workers compensation programs 
the tpas establish initial loss reserve estimates at the time a claim is reported and then monitor the development of the claim over time to confirm that such estimates continue to be appropriate 
management periodically reviews the claim reserves established by the tpas and engages independent actuaries to assist with the evaluation of the adequacy of its reserves on a semi annual basis 
we adjust our claim reserves with an associated charge or credit to expense as new information on the underlying claim is obtained 
reserves related to workers compensation claims totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
reserves related to general liability claims totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
deferred tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
asset impairment we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
in cases where the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the related carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the 
table of contents carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment annually and interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset may be impaired using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we perform our annual impairment test on june liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs are primarily to service long term debt  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and business development activities 
our ability to generate cash from operating activities is subject to  among other things  our operating performance as well as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may be beyond our control 
we believe that cash flow from operations coupled with existing cash balances and funds available through our million revolving credit facility and million letter of credit facility will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs through june  to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
cash flow throughout the year  we experience significant periodic outflows of cash for debt service  capital expenditures  workers compensation and general liability insurance premium deposits  k matching contributions and management bonuses 
these outflows include million in semi annual interest payments on our senior subordinated notes payable on september and march  as well as estimated quarterly interest payments on our term loan b of approximately million 
deposits on our annual workers compensation and general liability insurance programs are typically paid in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these deposits totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in our insurance deposits was primarily due to a delay in funding our excess general liability program negotiated and effective june in may  reliance insurance company returned million of cash collateral representing the remaining balance of our worker s compensation cash insurance deposits held by this carrier  and in may  we received million of refunds related to our retrospective workers compensation policy for the policy year ended april  in the third and fourth quarter  respectively 
during fiscal  we made unscheduled principal payments on our term loan b totaling million  made payments totaling million for capital expenditures  made payments under the management incentive program of million and funded the calendar employer match k liability of million 
the term loan b unscheduled principal payments discussed above satisfy the excess cash flow sweep requirement under the term loan b facility as of september during fiscal  we made a million unscheduled principal payment on our term loan b which was applied to the percent annual principal payment requirement  therefore  no principal payments are required until maturity in march additionally  we made a one time payment of million to our ceo under the 
table of contents terms of his employment agreement  paid bonuses to certain members of management totaling million associated with the refinancing of our debt in fiscal and paid bonuses of million each to the ceo and cfo during fiscal related to the successful completion of operational goals contemplated in the debt refinancing 
the table below summarizes cash flow information for fiscal  and in thousands years ended june  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the million or increase is primarily attributable to the net impact of an million decrease in net income and a million increase in net operating assets offset by a million increase in non cash charges 
the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to the recognition of million of deferred tax benefits in fiscal due to management s determination that the related deferred tax assets  primarily those relating to the company s net operating loss carryovers  would be realized in the future 
the increase in net operating assets is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable due to growth in medical transportation revenue and slowdown in collections from patients covered by certain forms of government insurance offset by reductions in amounts on deposit with the company s insurers 
the increase in non cash expenses is primarily attributable to the recognition in fiscal of the previously mentioned deferred tax benefits  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts caused by the previously mentioned growth in medical transportation revenue and lengthening of the collection cycle and the increase in non cash interest accrued on the company s senior discount notes during fiscal which were issued in march offset by the absence in fiscal of the non cash portion of the debt extinguishment charge recognized in fiscal and the classification of tax benefits from stock option exercises in operating activities in fiscal  as a result of the adoption of sfas r effective july   such tax benefits are now classified within financing activities 
we had working capital of million at june   including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at june  the increase in working capital as of june  is primarily related to higher net accounts receivable combined with lower accrued liabilities partially offset by lower cash balances related to unscheduled principal payments made during the year 
net cash provided by operating activities was higher in fiscal than fiscal  as net income in included the accretion of our senior discount notes and the related amortization of deferred financing costs which represent non cash interest expense that is included in net income but does not require cash payments during the current period and million related to the loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed in the refinancing activities section below 
in addition  net cash was provided by fluctuations in other operating assets and liabilities 
in the normal course of business  these accounts can vary significantly due to the amount and timing of various payments

we anticipate annual interest savings of approximately million as a result of these payments 
additionally  we made million in distributions to the city of san diego  the minority shareholder in our medical services joint venture 
the reduction in current year stock option exercises contributed to a million decrease in cash provided by the issuance of common stock  which was offset by million of tax benefits from the exercise of such options  prior to the adoption of sfas r  such amounts were included in net cash provided by operating activities

table of contents ebitda ebitda is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance 
while ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity  we believe this measure is useful to investors in assessing our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies

insurance programs many of our operational contracts  as well as laws in certain of the areas where we operate  require that we carry specified amounts of insurance coverage 
additionally  in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject to 
table of contents accident  injury and professional liability claims as a result of the nature of our business and the day to day operation of our vehicle fleet 
in order to minimize our risk of exposure  and to comply with such legal and contractual requirements  we carry a broad range of insurance policies  including comprehensive general liability  automobile  property damage  professional  workers compensation and other lines of coverage 
we typically renew each of these policies annually and purchase limits of coverage at levels we believe are appropriate  taking into account historical and projected claim trends  reasonable protection of our assets and operations and the economic conditions in the insurance market 
depending upon the specific line of coverage  the total limits of insurance maintained by us may be achieved through a combination of primary policies  excess policies and self insurance 
see risk factors claims against us could exceed our insurance coverage and we may not have coverage for certain claims 
we retain certain levels of exposure with respect to our general liability and workers compensation programs and purchase coverage from third party insurers for exposures in excess of those levels 
in addition to expensing premiums and other costs relating to excess coverage  we establish reserves for claims  both reported and incurred but not reported  on a gross basis using currently available information as well as our historical claims experience 
we also recognize a receivable from our insurers for amounts expected to be recovered in excess of our retention 
we regularly evaluate the financial capacity of our insurers to assess the recoverability of the related receivables 
see risk factors our claim reserves may prove inadequate 
we engage third party administrators tpas to manage claims resulting from our general liability and workers compensation programs 
the tpas establish initial loss reserve estimates at the time a claim is reported and then monitor the development of the claim over time to confirm that such estimates continue to be appropriate 
management periodically reviews the claim reserves established by the tpas and engage independent actuaries to assist with the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves on an annual basis 
we adjust our claim reserves with an associated charge or credit to expense as new information on the underlying claims is obtained 
in prior years  certain insurers required us to deposit cash into designated loss funds in order to fund claim payments within our retention limits 
total cash deposits relating to our insurance programs were million and million at june  and  respectively 
as of june   we replaced collateral previously held by the insurers with letters of credit in support of our fiscal policies which began on may  letters of credit in support of our insurance programs issued under our credit facility discussed in note totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
general liability we have historically maintained insurance policies for comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and professional liability 
throughout this report  these three types of policies are referred to collectively as the general liability policies 
these policies are typically renewed annually 
we engage independent actuaries to assist us with our evaluation of the adequacy of our general liability claim reserves 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than has been estimated  the reserves for general liability claims could be overstated or understated 
see risk factors our claim reserves may prove inadequate 

table of contents a summary of activity in our general liability claim reserves  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities and the non current portion of which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  is as follows in thousands gross claim reserves accounts receivable from insurers net claim reserves balance june  provision charged to other operating expense claim payments charged against the reserve increase in estimated recoverable claims balance june  provision charged to other operating expense claim payments charged against the reserve decrease in estimated recoverable claims balance june  provision charged to other operating expense claim payments charged against the reserve decrease in estimated recoverable claims balance june  over the past two years we have worked diligently to close our outstanding general liability claims 
we have also worked to minimize future losses through proactive risk management and workplace safety initiatives  including the implementation of drivecam technology in the ambulance fleet 
the progress towards these initiatives has given rise to favorable historical claims experience  which  in part  resulted in a reduction in our reserves by million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
workers compensation we have historically maintained insurance policies for workers compensation liability 
we are required by law and by most of our operational contracts to maintain minimum statutory limits of workers compensation insurance 
these policies are typically renewed annually 
we engage independent actuaries to assist with our evaluation of the adequacy of our workers compensation claim reserves 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than has been estimated  the reserves for workers compensation claims could be overstated or understated 
see risk factors our claim reserves may prove inadequate 

table of contents the following is a summary of activity in our workers compensation claim reserves  the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities and the non current portion of which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in thousands gross claim reserves accounts receivable from insurers net claim reserves balance june  claim payments charged against the reserve decrease in estimated recoverable claims balance june  provision charged to payroll and employee benefits increase in deposits retrospective rated premium refunds claim payments charged against the reserve decrease in estimated recoverable claims balance june  provision charged to payroll and employee benefits decrease in deposits retrospective rated premium refunds claim payments charged against the reserve decrease in estimated recoverable claims balance june  for annual policy years prior to may  and subsequent to may   our workers compensation policies include a deductible obligation with no annual aggregate limit 
loss provisions relating to reported claims as well as for claims incurred but not reported applicable to these policy years are based on currently available information as well as our historical claims experience 
amounts receivable from insurers for losses in excess of our deductible obligation are also recorded 
in each of the policy years ended april   and  we purchased workers compensation coverage under retrospectively rated policies whereby the related premiums are subject to adjustment at certain intervals based on subsequent reviews of actual losses incurred as well as payroll amounts 
we determined that the policies for the policy years ended april  and effectively transferred the risk of loss to the insurer 
as a result  the cost applicable to those policy years consisted entirely of the related premium expense 
during fiscal  a premium refund applicable to the policy year ended april  was received in the amount of million and was recognized as a reduction of workers compensation expense 
additionally  during fiscal  a payroll audit applicable to the policy year ended april  was completed and resulted in additional premiums and related workers compensation expense of million 
finally  during fiscal and  we reduced our estimated premium refunds by million and million  respectively  relating to these policy years based upon an updated loss assessment prepared by our independent actuaries 
with respect to our workers compensation policy for the policy year ended april   we determined that the risk of loss was not effectively transferred to the insurer 
as a result  we recorded a deposit for amounts paid to the insurer during the policy period in excess of the insurers identified premiums along with a corresponding insurance claim reserve 
these amounts are periodically revalued as claims are paid under the policy 
during may  we received a partial refund of our deposit in the amount of million as a result of our improved claims experience 
such improved claims experience also resulted in a million reduction in our related claim reserves during fiscal as of june  and  our deposit balances for the retrospective policy year ended april  were million and million  respectively 
at june  and  our claim reserves for this policy were million and million  respectively

indemnifications we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct or breach of representations and warranties and covenants 
additionally  some of our agreements with customers require us to provide certain assurances related to the performance of our services 
such assurances  from time to time  obligate us to  i pay penalties for failure to meet response times or other requirements  ii lease  sell or assign equipment or facilities either temporarily or permanently in the event of uncured material defaults or other certain circumstances  or iii provide surety bonds or letters of credit issued in favor of the customer to cover costs resulting  under certain circumstances  from an uncured material default or transition to a new service provider 
with respect to such surety bonds  we are also required to indemnify the surety company for losses paid as a result of any claims made against such bonds 
we provide for indemnification of directors  officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements  certificates of incorporation  bylaws  articles of association or similar organizational documents  as the case may be 
we maintain directors and officers insurance which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on our borrowing activities 
under our credit facility  amounts outstanding under term loan b bear interest at libor plus percent and amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus percent 
based on current amounts outstanding under term loan b  a percent increase in the libor rate would increase our interest expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
the remainder of our debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
we monitor the risk associated with interest rate changes and may enter into hedging transactions  such as interest rate swap agreements  to mitigate the related exposure
