divided policy holders of the company s common shares are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available therefore 
the company  however  has never declared any cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate the payment of cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain our earnings to support the development and growth of our business and to strengthen our capital base 
we may consider payment of dividends at some point in the future  but the declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors  and there is no assurance that dividends will be paid at any time 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from coast bank and its revenues are derived principally from coast bank 
accordingly  our ability to pay cash dividends on the common shares in the future generally will be largely dependent on dividends that the company receives from coast bank to fund such dividends 
the payment of dividends by coast bank will depend upon its ability to pay and a number of other factors  such as capital requirements  regulatory limitations  coast bank s results of operations and financial condition  tax considerations  and general economic conditions 
for a discussion of the applicable federal and state regulatory requirements relating to a payment of dividends by us or by coast bank  see item business supervision and regulation bank regulation

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a bank holding company and our principal asset is our ownership of coast bank 
accordingly  our results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of the operations of coast bank 
through coast bank  we conduct a commercial banking business  which consists of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer  and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
we have experienced substantial growth in our loan portfolio and deposits since inception 
our profitability depends significantly on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie  loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie  customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest bearing assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any increase in interest rates generally will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demands 
our profitability also is affected by such factors as the level of noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses  and the effective tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and other fees and income from the sale of loans and investment securities 
noninterest expenses consist of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdic  expenses of opening a branch office or offices  and other operating expenses 
our total assets  on a consolidated basis  as of december   december  and december  were million  million and million  respectively 
the overall increase in our total assets from december to december  respectively was primarily due to an increase in net loans of million 
similarly  the growth in our total assets for december  to were primarily due to increases of net loans of million 
asset growth from december  to december  was funded by a million increase in deposits and from december  to was funded by a million increase in deposits 
trends and developments impacting our recent results certain trends emerged and developments have occurred that are important in understanding our recent results and that are potentially significant in assessing future performance 
impact of expansion on noninterest expense 
we plan to continue to open additional branches in the greater tampa bay region 
we anticipate that our expansion activities will result in a significant increase in occupancy and equipment expense 
the typical investment for us to open a leased branch office is between  and  whereas the investment to construct and furnish a new branch owned by us will be approximately  plus the cost to purchase the land on which the branch is located 
consistent with our historical growth strategy  as we open new offices and expand both within and outside our current markets  we plan to recruit seasoned relationship bankers  thereby increasing our salary expenses 
initially  this increase in salary expense is expected to be higher than the revenues to be received from the customer relationships brought to us by the new relationship bankers 
currently  we anticipate opening branches this year  eight of which are the acquired branches and four of which will be de novo branches located in the greater tampa bay region 
we anticipate investing approximately million in start up and renovation costs to open all of these branches  as well as the hiring of 
table of contents approximately bankers and other personnel to operate those branches 
the anticipated employee costs for are approximately million 
the costs associated with our expansion activities will be funded from the proceeds from the public offering of our common shares 
in addition to the start up costs associated with the opening of new branches  we anticipate that the composition of the deposit base at each such branch initially will be comprised predominately of time deposits which will increase our overall cost of funds 
as a result  it is likely that our profitability and our net interest spread and net interest margin will be adversely affected until our expansion branches become profitable and we are able to attract acceptable levels of core deposits 
growth in our market areas 
the significant population and economic growth of the greater tampa bay region where we conduct the majority of our operations have fueled our growth in particular 
the continued population growth has resulted in an increase in the acquisition of raw land for residential and commercial development  the construction of residential communities  shopping centers and office buildings  and the development and expansion of the businesses and professions that provide essential goods and services to this expanded population 
other noninterest expense items 
with respect to our other noninterest expense items  we anticipate that we will incur additional expenses of approximately  to  for professional expenses and other costs related to compliance with the reporting requirements of the united states securities laws and the first year of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of critical accounting policies the notes to consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies  including discussions on recently issued accounting pronouncements  whether we intend to adopt them and the related impact of their adoption 
we believe that certain of these policies  along with various estimates that we are required to make in recording our financial transactions  are important in order to completely understand our financial position 
in addition  these estimates require us to make complex and subjective judgments  many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty 
the following is a discussion of these critical accounting polices and significant estimates 
additional information about these policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers to be adequate to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio  based on evaluations of the collectibility and historical loss experience of loans 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan losses are based on our review of the historical loan loss experience and such factors that  in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing the appropriate allowance level consists of several key elements described below 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flows  and available legal options 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended 
any specific reserves for impaired loans are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying collateral 
we evaluate the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a special reserve 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  are not individually reviewed by management 
reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category 

table of contents historical loss rates for all loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions or loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the local economy  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs  nonaccrual and problem loans  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and our internal credit review function 
specific reserves on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed throughout the year and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
based on the procedures discussed above  management believes that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb estimated loan losses associated with the loan portfolio at december  actual results could differ from these estimates 
however  since the allowance is affected by management s judgment and uncertainties  there is the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions 
to the extent that the economy changes  collateral values change  reserve factors change  or the nature and volume of problem loans change  we may need to adjust our provision for loan losses 
material additions to our provision for loan losses would adversely affect net earnings and capital 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we do not record any compensation expense for stock options we grant to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
we comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which require that we disclose our pro forma net earnings or loss and net earnings or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
and apb no 
sfas no 
r clarifies and expands sfas no 
s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability  accounting for non substantive vesting provisions  and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the alternative to use apb no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas no 
 as originally issued  is eliminated 
effective january   the company will begin expensing the fair value of unvested stock options and any future grants of stock options 
based on the amount of unvested stock options as of december   the company will record compensation expense of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
general this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses on a consolidated basis the operating results and financial condition of the company for the fiscal years ended december    and the discussion and analysis set forth below is intended to assist you in understanding the financial condition and results of our operations 
for purposes of this discussion  references to the company relate to the company and coast bank on a consolidated basis after april   and to coast bank prior to april  you should read this discussion together with your review of our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other statistical information contained herein 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately  or basic and diluted losses per share applicable to common shareholders of  as compared to net earnings of 
table of contents  or basic and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  the decrease in net earnings in compared to the same period in was attributable primarily to an increase in noninterest expenses  a decrease in noninterest income  and an increase in the provision for loan losses partially offset by an increase in net interest income 
the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to branch expansion costs and increased advertising and marketing costs and the increase in the loan loss provision was due primarily to the high risk loans identified as part of our loan review  including those which resulted in a million charge off in the second quarter of our total assets at december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or approximately  from december  the majority of the increase was due to an increase of net loans of million 
our net loans at december  totaled approximately million net  or approximately of the total assets 
of the total  portfolio loans consisted of approximately million in commercial loans  approximately million in commercial real estate loans  approximately million in residential real estate loans  and approximately million in consumer and other loans  net of deferred costs and allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
the allowance for loan losses increased from million at december  to million at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  was of portfolio loans 
net interest income 
net interest income  which constitutes the principal source of income for coast bank  is the difference between interest earned on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
our principal interest earning assets are loans  investment securities  and short term investments 
interest bearing liabilities primarily consist of customer deposits such as interest paying checking accounts or now accounts  retail savings deposits  money market accounts  and time deposits  repurchase agreements  and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
funds attracted by these interest bearing liabilities are invested by the bank in interest earning assets 
accordingly  net interest income depends on the volume of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
total interest income for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively  on average outstanding balances of interest earning assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to a million increase in interest generated from an million increase in the average loan balance 
the five branches opened in contributed million in interest income for the year ended december  interest expense on interest bearing liabilities for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to a million increase in average interest bearing deposits 
the average cost of our average interest bearing liabilities increased to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december   due to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing deposits from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the five branches opened in accounted for million in interest expense for the year ended december  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the loan loss provision in was substantially increased due to the charge offs made in the second quarter of with respect to the high risk loans identified in february that we have been working to restructure or exit as part of our asset quality initiative

allowance for loan losses was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of total net loans at the end of each period 

table of contents noninterest income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in noninterest income for the year ended december  primarily was primarily due to one time gains experienced in in connection with the sale of our credit card portfolio  merchant services  and mortgage loan servicing rights  which gains were partially offset by an increase from gains on the sale of loans held for sale 
the increase in gain on sale of loans in  when compared to the year ended december   was due to an increase in loans sold 
in addition  other service charges and fees for the period decreased  primarily due to the discontinued merchant services 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
our most significant noninterest expenses  those related to salaries and employee benefits  were approximately and  respectively  of such noninterest expenses for the years ended december  and the increase in noninterest expense in was due primarily to salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses due to the opening of five branch offices  and the renovation of the downtown building  and the hiring of employees to support the overall growth of coast bank and an increase of  in advertising expenditure

net interest income 
total interest income for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively  on average outstanding balances of interest earning assets of approximately million and million  respectively

the increase was due primarily to an million increase in average interest bearing deposits which more than offset the effects of lower market interest rates 
the average cost of our average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in the year ended december   from in the year ended december   which is the result of an improvement in our core deposits and the lower rates paid on deposit accounts 

table of contents provision for loan losses

in an effort to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio  management seeks to minimize higher risk types of lending and additional precautions have been taken when such loans are made in order to reduce our risk of loss 
as a newly formed banking institution  our loans are relatively unseasoned and the make up of the loan portfolio is subject to monthly fluctuations 
as of december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our loan portfolio was collateralized by first liens on owner occupied residential loans  construction loans  land loans  and all other commercial real estate  all of which have historically been a relatively low credit risk 
generally  construction loans present a higher degree of risk to a lender compared to conventional residential mortgage loans depending upon  among other things  whether the borrower has permanent financing at the end of the loan period  whether the project is an income producing transaction in the interim  and the nature of changing economic conditions including changing interest rates 
loans outside our local market area also entail risks 
we attempt to mitigate these risks by engaging reputable broker correspondents 
commercial loans also entail certain risks since they usually involve large loan balances to single borrowers or a related group of borrowers  resulting in a more concentrated loan portfolio 
further  since their repayment is usually dependent upon the successful operation of the commercial enterprise  they also are subject to adverse conditions in the economy 
commercial loans are generally riskier than residential mortgages because they are typically made on the basis of the ability to repay from the cash flow of a business rather than on the ability of 
table of contents the borrower or guarantor to repay 
further  the collateral underlying commercial loans may depreciate over time  and occasionally cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate  and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
while there is no assurance that we will not suffer any losses on our construction or commercial real estate loans  management has sought to reduce the risks associated therewith by  among other things  making substantially all of such loans in connection with owner occupied projects  projects where the borrower has received permanent financing commitments from which our loan will be repaid  and projects where the borrower has demonstrated to management that its business will generate sufficient income to repay the loan 
we also seek to further limit our risks by primarily entering into agreements with individuals who are familiar to coast bank personnel  are residents of our primary market area  and are believed by management to be good credit risks 
consumer loans are primarily fixed rate products  and  as a result  they have interest rate risk when market rates increase 
these loans also have credit risk with minimal security 
management attempts to mitigate credit and interest rate risk by keeping the products offered short term  receiving a rate of return commensurate with the risk  and lending to individuals known in its market area 
in addition to maintaining high quality assets  management also limits coast bank s risk exposure to any one borrower or borrowers with similar or related entities 
loan concentrations are defined as amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
on a routine basis we evaluate these concentrations for purposes of policing these concentrations and to make necessary adjustments in our lending practices that most clearly reflect the economic times  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
at december  total loans to any particular group of customers engaged in similar activities or having similar economic characteristics did not exceed of total loans 
the board of directors of coast bank concentrates its efforts and resources  and that of our senior management and lending officials  on loan review and underwriting procedures 
in addition  we have retained the services of stogniew associates  independent consultants  to perform loan documentation and compliance reviews three times per year  as well as deposit and operations compliance reviews 
as part of this process  our loans are reviewed to assess the adequacy of our internal loan credit risk grading system and to alert management with respect to any potential problems that may require remedial action 
senior loan officers also have established a review process with the objective of quickly identifying  evaluating  and initiating necessary corrective action for substandard loans 
although we strive to maintain our asset quality based on underwriting and credit standards  the loan portfolio is unseasoned and its quality has not yet been substantiated through historical experience 
upon the occurrence of a nonperforming loan  management monitors collection activities  which include ten day delinquency letters  customer contact by telephone  and referral to the collection supervisor for review 
the collection supervisor is charged with determining the collectibility of the debt  the potential for an extension or workout  and a review of our collateral position 
if the loan becomes days past due  actions are taken to take possession of the collateral  charge off any deficiency balance  and pursue legal action as necessary 
real property loan defaults are referred to legal counsel for foreclosure action 
at december  we had million of loans on non accrual status  no loans past due days or more still accruing interest  and no foreclosed real estate 
financial condition lending activities general 
coast bank s loan portfolio consists of commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  residential construction loans  residential mortgage loans  and consumer loans primarily home equity loans and advances 
most of the borrowers are located in the county where our branches are located or in the surrounding counties 
our residential construction loan program  however  has borrowers throughout the state of florida 

table of contents coast bank s loans are subject to state and federal laws and regulation 
interest rates charged by us on loans are affected by the bank s current asset liability strategy  the demand for various types of loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors 
these factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative tax polices and governmental budgetary matters

the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual term because of prepayments 
the average life of a loan tends to increase  however  when the current market rates for that particular type of loan are substantially higher than rates on an existing loan and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on an existing loan are substantially higher than the current market rate for that particular type of loan 
prepayment penalties attempt to lessen the income impact of borrowers prepaying their loans by imposing fees for any early prepayment of the loan 

table of contents sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table sets forth as of december   the dollar amounts of loans due after one year which had predetermined interest rates and loans due after one year which had floating or adjustable interest rates 
due after december  fixed adjustable total in thousands commercial commercial real estate consumer residential real estate residential construction total loans classification of assets generally  interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based upon the principal balance outstanding 
it is management s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify a loan as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not adequately collateralized  or when in the opinion of management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation 
consumer loans will be charged off after days of delinquency unless adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
loans will not be returned to accrual status until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear certain 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance 
in this regard  we have implemented the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under this standard  a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we will evaluate individual  commercial and commercial real estate loans for impairment from internally generated watch lists and other sources 
loans meeting the criteria for impairment may or may not be placed on non accrual status  based on the loan s current status 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
loans  including impaired loans  generally will be classified by us as non accrual loans if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well collateralized and in the process of collection 
if a loan or a portion of a loan is classified as doubtful or is partially charged off  the loan is classified as a non accrual loan 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
while a loan is classified as non accrual and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
in the case where a non accrual loan had been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for credit losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered 
in addition  we perform ongoing reviews of our new and existing loans to identify  evaluate  and initiate corrective action for substandard loans 

table of contents as of december   we had eight loans on a non accrual status totaling million  or of total loans  and had no foreclosed real estate 
in comparison  at december   and  we had and loans  respectively  on non accrual status totaling million and million  and had no foreclosed real estate 
at december   we had five loans on non accrual status totaling  and had foreclosed real estate of approximately  at december   we had no loans on non accrual status and had foreclosed real estate of approximately  for years ended december      and  interest income on loans would have increased approximately     and  respectively  if the interest on non accrual loans had been recorded under the original terms of such loans

it is management s policy to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  management s loan loss experience  evaluation of economic conditions  and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is divided into two primary allocation groups a specific allocation loans  and b all other passing grade loans 
for specific allocation loans  we have determined an allowance amount to set aside which we believe is sufficient to cover any potential collateral shortfall 
problem loans are identified by the loan officer  loan review process  loan committee of coast bank  or by coast bank s regulatory examiners 
those loans identified as problem loans are assigned a risk grade 
loans graded as special mention are multiplied by an inherent loss factor of if collateralized by real estate and for all other loans to determine the amount to be included in the allowance 
loans graded as substandard are generally multiplied by a loss factor of  loans graded as doubtful are generally multiplied by a loss factor of and loans graded as loss are multiplied by a loss factor of 
in addition to the and on substandard and doubtful loans the loans are individually reviewed for any additional reserve that may be necessary 
all other 
table of contents loans  graded as pass are multiplied by an historical experience factor to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to historical experience factors  we also provide for losses due to economic factors  concentration of credit  and portfolio composition changes 
management monitors our asset quality and will charge off loans against the allowance for credit losses when appropriate or provide specific loss allowances when necessary 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the economic conditions in the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
because mortgage loans held for sale  including construction to permanent loans  are not expected to be held in our loan portfolio and we believe our risk of loss on such loans is less than loans held in our loan portfolio  we do not maintain the reserve on loans held for sale 
as of december   our allowance for loan losses was approximately  or of total loans as of such date

scheduled loan payments of principal and interest are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
coast bank may use borrowings on a short term basis if necessary to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposit activities

as of december   coast bank held repurchase agreements  which are used as sweep accounts for commercial customers  of approximately million 
in the future  coast bank also will rely on loan repayments  loan sales  and the sale of investment securities as additional sources of funding 
in addition  in the future if there are periods when the supply of funds from deposits or other sources cannot meet the demand for loans  coast bank has the ability to seek a portion of the needed funds through advances from the fhlb where it currently has a million line of credit

further  there were no short term borrowings at december   and  other than million in federal funds purchased from a correspondent bank at december  asset liability management one of our primary objectives is to control fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the board of directors of coast bank has established interest rate risk policies and procedures which delegate to the asset liability management committee alco the responsibility to monitor and report on interest rate risk  devise strategies to manage interest rate risk  monitor loan origination and deposit activity  and approve all pricing strategies 
the management of interest rate risk is one of the most significant factors affecting our ability to achieve future earnings 
the principal measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities for the periods being measured  commonly referred to as the gap for such period 
an asset or liability is considered interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period being analyzed 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
when the opposite occurs  
table of contents the gap is considered to be negative 
during periods of increasing interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect income while a positive gap would tend to result in net interest income 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  the inverse would tend to occur 
if the maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any material or prolonged increase or decrease in interest rates or net interest income on existing assets or liabilities would be minimal 
it is common to focus on the one year gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets and the dollar amount of liabilities maturing or repricing within the next months 
the alco uses an internal model to analyze our current financial position and test different strategies prior to implementation 
the system attempts to simulate coast bank s asset and liability base and project future operating results under several interest rate and spread assumptions 
under asset liability management guidelines  it is our policy to maintain a cumulative one year gap of no more than of total assets  primarily by managing the maturity distribution of our investment portfolio and emphasizing loan originations tied to interest sensitive indices 
additionally  we have joined the fhlb to enhance our liquidity position and provide the ability to utilize fixed rate advances to improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in certain periods 
coast bank s cumulative one year gap at december  was relatively flat and slightly negative at approximately  or  expressed as a percentage of total assets as compared to a negative one year gap at approximately million or  expressed as a percentage of total assets at december  
table of contents the following table presents our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  which are expected to mature or are subject to repricing in each of the time periods indicated 
the table may not be indicative of our rate sensitive position at other points in time 
the balances have been derived based on the financial characteristics of the various assets and liabilities 
adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than their scheduled maturity dates

table of contents market risk management our market risk is the risk of loss that may result from changes in market prices and rates 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when related offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
accordingly  while the alco relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk  a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates of our assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the alco also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
because gap analysis may not adequately address the interest rate risk  we also use simulation models to analyze net income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
economic value of equity 
we measure the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  defined as economic value of equity  using a simulation model 
this simulation model assesses the changes in the market value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease shock in market interest rates 
at december   our economic value of equity exposure related to those hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us 
the following table shows our projected change in economic value of equity for this set of rate shock at december  interest rate scenario economic value percentage change from base percentage of total assets percentage of equity book value dollars in thousands up basis points up basis points base down basis points down basis points the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  asset prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
actual amounts may differ from the projections set forth above should market conditions vary from the underlying assumptions 
net interest income simulation 
in order to measure interest rate risk at december   we used a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between net income forecasted using a rising and a falling interest rate 
table of contents scenario and a net interest income using a base market interest rate derived from the current treasury yield curve 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the repricing relationship for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to reprice immediately in proportion to a change in market rates as specified in the underlying contractual agreements 
accordingly  the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest the proceeds at current yields 
our non term deposit products reprice more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over months by basis points 
at december   our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us 
interest rate scenario adjusted net interest income percentage change from base dollars in thousands up basis points up basis points base down basis points down basis points off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations through the normal course of business  the company enters into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
these obligations generally relate to leases for premises and equipment 
in addition  the company  as a financial institution  enters into off balance sheet agreements  including commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  unfunded construction loans  unused lines of credit  and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the company s involvement in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  unfunded construction loans  unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies  and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 

table of contents commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party and to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments 
unused lines of credit and commitments to extend credit typically result in loans with a market interest rate

our sources of funds have been from deposits received  capital infusions from the sale of our securities  proceeds from maturities  calls  repayments  proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale  and proceeds received in connection with repurchase agreements 

table of contents the retention of existing deposits and attraction of new deposit sources through new and existing customers is critical to our liquidity position 
the company  through its banking locations  offers a variety of deposit products at competitive market interest rates 
ensuring competitive rates and terms generally retains maturing time deposits and liquid deposits 
in the event of compression in liquidity due to a run off in deposits  we have a liquidity policy and procedure that provides for certain actions under varying liquidity conditions 
such actions include  borrowing from the fhlb and existing correspondent banks  the selling or participating of loans  and the curtailment of loan commitments and fundings 
for the year ended december    and  the company had net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  net cash used in investing activities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and net cash provided by financing activities of approximately  million  and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company raised million  net of offering expenses  through the public offering of its common stock 
the proceeds will be used to finance our growth and expansion plans 
further  coast bank also has the ability to borrow funds from the fhlb to supplement its liquidity needs 
at december   coast bank had a line of credit with the fhlb of million  of which million had been borrowed 
in addition to its fhlb borrowing capacity  coast bank also has arranged for a million line of credit with independent bankers bank  bearing interest at prime minus and a million line of credit with compass bank  which bears interest at the then current federal funds rate  to be used to purchase federal funds 
no amounts are outstanding on either credit facility 
the company also has arranged for a million line with independent bankers bank  bearing interest at prime minus  to provide capital financing for coast bank  if needed 
no draws have been taken on this line of credit and any such draws would require the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of atlanta 
we recently made a successful bid with american financial realty trust to lease eight former branch facilities of other financial institutions located in the greater tampa bay region referred to herein as the acquired branches  and we anticipate opening each of these as a new coast bank branch during we have entered into year leases for each of these branches which will obligate us to pay initial annual base rent in an aggregate of approximately million  as well as other occupancy expenses 
further  we will be required to pay an annual management fee equal to of the then annual base rent 
these lease obligations have received the necessary regulatory approvals and we took possession of certain of these facilities in december we will carry these lease expenses and the other expenses associated with such branch locations prior to their opening 
in addition to these carrying costs  we will need to renovate each of these branch locations our historical renovation costs have run between  to  per branch and hire employees to run and operate each branch 
in addition to these eight branches  we also plan to open four de novo branches in we anticipate that the net proceeds from the sale of our common shares in november will provide the necessary capital for our current expansion activities and will otherwise satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  if we continue to achieve our anticipated growth levels and or significant opportunities to expand our business operations present themselves  the company may require additional funds in order to finance such growth and planned expansion activities 
accordingly  in such an event  the company may consider and evaluate a variety of additional sources of funds and capital to meet its cash requirements  including the sale of equity securities  debt financings and borrowings  trust preferred offerings  and other financings alternatives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing  if needed  or  if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein concerning the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
federal and state taxation federal income taxation 
under the internal revenue code the code  we are subject to income taxation in the same general manner as are other corporations  with some exceptions due to the provisions of sections through of the code  which apply specifically to financial institutions 
the following discussion of federal income taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
the two primary areas in which the treatment of financial institutions differ from the treatment of other corporations under the code are in the areas of bond gains and losses and bad debt deductions 
bond gains and losses generated from the sale or exchange of portfolio instruments are generally treated for financial institutions as ordinary gains and losses as opposed to capital gains and losses for other corporations  as the code considers bond portfolios held by banks to be inventory in a trade or business rather than capital assets 
banks are allowed a statutory method for calculating a reserve for bad debt deductions 
state taxation 
we file state income tax returns in florida 
for florida tax purposes  the bank s taxable income is calculated based on federal taxable income  using the same principles as other corporations  subject to certain adjustments 
deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable earnings  which resulted in net deferred tax assets of million 

table of contents these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts in the years through unless fully utilized by us 
based on management s estimate of future earnings and the expiration dates of the net operating loss carryforwards as of december   it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards reduces the amount of the related deferred tax asset by the amount of such utilization at the current enacted tax rates 
other deferred tax items resulting in temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses such as the allowance for loan losses  loan fees  accumulated depreciation and cash to accrual adjustments will fluctuate from year to year
