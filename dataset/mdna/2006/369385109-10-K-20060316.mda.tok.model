item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about the effect of geographic concentration and the alaska economy on us 
employees we employed  persons as of january   and we are not party to union contracts with our employees 
we believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees 
we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 
other no material portion of our businesses is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government 
item a 
risk factors 
factors that may affect our business and future results additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we face competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
there is substantial competition in the communications industry 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance telephone service  local telephone service  wireless telephone service  internet services and video services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers and various service integration strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated communications services offerings within and across geographic markets 
we expect competition to increase as a result of the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on marketing and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in competitive factors in our industry and in our markets  we could lose market share or experience a decline in our revenue and net income 
competitive conditions create a risk of market share loss and the risk that customers shift to less profitable lower margin services 
competitive pressures also create challenges for our ability to grow new businesses or introduce new services successfully and execute our business plan 
each of our business segments also faces the risk of potential price cuts by our competitors that could materially adversely affect our market share and gross margins 
long distance services 
the long distance industry is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  the type of services offered  customer service  billing services  performance  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
current or future competitors could be substantially larger than we are  or have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in the long distance market  we compete against at t alascom  acs  mta and certain smaller rural local telephone carrier affiliates 
there is also the possibility that new competitors will enter the alaska market 
in addition  wireless services continue to grow as an alternative to wireline services as a means of reaching customers 
historically  we have competed in the long distance market by offering discounts from rates charged by our competitors and by providing desirable packages of services 
discounts have been eroded in recent years due to lowering of prices by at t alascom and entry of other competitors into the long distance markets we serve 
in addition  our competitors offer their own packages of services 
if competitors lower their rates further or develop more attractive packages of services  we may be forced to reduce our rates or add additional services  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
cable services 
our cable television systems face competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals  including dbs and digital video over telephone lines  and from other sources of news  information and entertainment such as off air television broadcast programming  newspapers  movie theaters  live sporting events  interactive computer services  internet services and home video products  including videotape cassettes and video disks 
our cable television systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems by other cable television operators and alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals 
the extent to which our cable television systems are competitive depends  in part  upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices 
we believe that the greatest source of potential competition for video services could come from the dbs industry 
we also are subject to competition from providers of digital video over telephone lines in the mat su valley and in ketchikan in with the addition of anchorage local broadcast stations  increased marketing  ilec and dbs alliances  and emerging technologies creating new opportunities  competition from these sources has increased and will likely continue to increase 
the changing nature of technology and of the dbs business may result in greater satellite coverage within the state of alaska 
the resulting increase in competition may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our cable services segment 
local telephone services 
in the local telephone market  we compete against acs the ilec  in anchorage  juneau and fairbanks 
we plan to provide local telephone service in other locations in the future where we would face other competitors 
in the local telephone services market  the telecom act  judicial decisions  state and federal legislative and regulatory developments  and new technologies have increased the overall likelihood that barriers to local telephone competition will be substantially reduced or removed 
these initiatives include requirements that local exchange carriers negotiate with entities  including us  to provide interconnection to the existing local telephone network  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way and to resell services offered by the ilec 
we have been able to obtain interconnection  access and related services from the lecs  at rates that allow us to offer competitive services 
however  if we are unable to continue to obtain these services and access at acceptable rates  our ability to offer local telephone services  and our revenues and net income  could be materially adversely affected 
to date  we have been successful in capturing a significant portion of the local telephone market in the locations where we are offering these services 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting or retaining these customers 
internet services 
the internet industry is highly competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change 
competition is based upon price and pricing plans  service packages  the types of services offered  the technologies used  customer service  billing services  perceived quality  reliability and availability 
we compete with several alaska based internet providers and other domestic  non alaska based providers 
several of the providers have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
with respect to our high speed cable modem service  acs and other alaska telephone service providers are providing competitive high speed internet access over their telephone lines 
dbs providers and others also provide wireless high speed internet service in competition with our high speed cable modem services 
competitive local fixed wireless providers are providing service in certain of our markets as is a national wimax based provider in anchorage with plans for juneau and fairbanks 
wimax is a standards based wireless technology that provides high throughput broadband connections over long distances 
wimax can be used for a number of applications  including last mile broadband connections  hotspots and cellular backhaul  and high speed enterprise connectivity for business 
niche providers in the industry  both local and national  compete with certain of our internet service products  such as web hosting  list services and email 
our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation 
applicable legislation and regulations and changes to them could adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
local telephone services 
our success in the local telephone market depends on our continued ability to obtain interconnection  access and related services from local exchange carriers on terms that are just and reasonable and that are based on the cost of providing these services 
our local telephone services business faces the risk of the impact of the implementation of current regulations and legislation  unfavorable changes in regulation or legislation or the introduction of new regulations 
our ability to enter into the local telephone market depends on our negotiation or arbitration with local exchange carriers to allow interconnection to the carrier s existing local telephone network  to establish dialing parity  to obtain access to rights of way  to resell services offered by the local exchange carrier  and in some cases  to allow the purchase  at cost based rates  of access to unbundled network elements 
in many alaska markets  it also depends on our ability to gain interconnection at economic costs  and in some of these markets  it further depends on our ability to have the rural exemption for certain carriers terminated  so these carriers are obligated to provide access to unbundled network elements at economic costs 
future arbitration and rural exemption proceedings with respect to new or existing markets could result in a change in our cost of serving these markets via the facilities of the ilec or via wholesale offerings 
cable services 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive regulation at various levels  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals 
the law permits certified local franchising authorities to order refunds of rates paid in the previous month period determined to be in excess of the reasonable rates 
it is possible that rate reductions or refunds of previously collected fees may be required of us in the future 
currently  pursuant to alaska law  the basic cable rates in juneau are the only rates in alaska subject to regulation by the local franchising authority  and the rates in juneau were reviewed and approved by the rca in october other existing federal regulations  currently the subject of judicial  legislative  and administrative review  could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which cable television systems operate 
neither the outcome of these proceedings nor their impact upon the cable television industry in general  or on our activities and prospects in the cable television business in particular  can be predicted at this time 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory actions taken by congress  the fcc or other federal  state or local government authorities will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
proposals may be made before congress and the fcc to mandate cable operators provide open access over their cable systems to internet service providers 
as of the date of this report  the fcc has declined to impose such requirements 
if the fcc or other authorities mandate additional access to our cable systems  we cannot predict the effect that this would have on our internet service offerings 
internet services 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the internet access market  including changes in legislation  fcc regulation  judicial action or local regulation that affect communications costs or increase competition from the ilec or other communications services providers  could adversely affect the prices at which we sell internet services 
we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and business 
the loss of any of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for the year ended december   we provided long distance services excluding private lines and other revenue to mci  dobson  and sprint nextel which generated combined revenues of approximately of our total revenues for these customers are free to seek out long distance communications services from our competitors upon expiration of their contracts in december in the case of mci verizon beginning january  in in the case of dobson  and in march in the case of sprint nextel or earlier upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events including a default  the occurrence of a force majeure event  or a substantial change in applicable law or regulation under the applicable contract 
additionally  the contracts provide for periodic reviews to assure that the prices paid by mci and sprint nextel for their services remain competitive 
mergers and acquisitions in the communications industry are relatively common 
if a change in control of dobson or sprint nextel were to occur  and in the case of the change in control of mci to verizon as of january  such change in control would not permit them to terminate their existing contracts with us  but could in the future result in the termination of or a material adverse change in our relationships with mci  dobson or sprint nextel 
in addition  mci s  dobson s and sprint nextel s need for our long distance services depends directly upon their ability to obtain and retain their own long distance and wireless customers and upon the needs of those customers for long distance services 
the loss of one or more of mci  dobson or sprint nextel as customers  a material adverse change in our relationships with either of them or a material loss of or reduction in their long distance customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
our businesses are currently geographically concentrated in alaska 
any deterioration in the economic conditions in alaska could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we offer voice and data communication and video services to customers primarily in the state of alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  our growth and operations depend upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon natural resource industries  in particular oil production  as well as tourism  and government spending including substantial amounts for the united states military 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on the demand for communication and cable television services and on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the customer base in alaska is limited 
alaska has a population of approximately  people  approximately of whom are located in the anchorage area 
we have already achieved significant market penetration with respect to our service offerings in anchorage and in other locations in alaska 
we may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services and no assurance can be given that the alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer 
as a result  the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the contiguous lower states 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside the state of alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities 
the markets in alaska for voice and data communications and video services are unique and distinct within the united states due to alaska s large geographical size and its distance from the rest of the united states 
the expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in the state of alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets 
we may not develop our wireless services  in which case we could not meet the needs of our customers who desire packaged services 
we offer wireless mobile services by distributing other providers wireless mobile services 
we offer wireless local telephone services over our own facilities  and have purchased personal communications system  or pcs  and local multipoint distribution system  or lmds  wireless broadband licenses in fcc auctions covering markets in alaska 
we have entered into an agreement to acquire a substantial ownership interest in alaska digitel see part i item business historical development of our business during the past fiscal year alaska digitel acquisition for more information 
we have fewer subscribers to our wireless services than to our other service offerings 
the geographic coverage of our wireless services is also smaller than the geographic coverage of our other services 
some of our competitors offer or propose to offer an integrated bundle of communications  entertainment and information services  including wireless services 
if we are unable to expand and further develop our wireless services  we may not be able to meet the needs of customers who desire packaged services  and our competitors who offer these services would have an advantage 
this could result in the loss of market share for our other service offerings 
as a pcs and lmds licensee  we are subject to regulation by the fcc  and must comply with certain build out and other conditions of the licenses  as well as with the fcc s regulations governing the pcs and lmds services 
the conditions of our pcs licenses required us to satisfy certain build out requirements on or before june  in february we submitted a filing to the fcc supporting our compliance with such requirements  and the fcc renewed the license effective august   for an additional year license term 
our efforts to deploy dlps may be unsuccessful  in which case the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve and we will not recover any capital investment that we have made in dlps 
an element of our business strategy is to deploy voice telephone service utilizing our hybrid fiber coax cable facilities 
in april we successfully launched our dlps deployment utilizing our anchorage coaxial cable facilities 
dlps allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
to continue to successfully deploy this service  we must integrate new technology with our existing facilities and modify our operating procedures to timely detect and effect repairs of our outside plant network 
the long term viability of this service depends on the adoption of industry wide standards for the sending and receiving of voice communications over cable facilities and the availability of the equipment necessary to provide the service at a cost effective price 
the deployment of this service requires a substantial capital investment by us 
if we are unable to successfully deploy dlps to a sufficiently large portion of our customer base  we will not be able to recover all of the capital investment we may make and the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve 
prolonged service interruptions could affect our business 
we rely heavily on our network equipment  communications providers  data and software  to support all of our functions 
we rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues 
we are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or communication failures  computer viruses  natural disasters  unauthorized access and other disruptions 
while we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back up systems and procedures  we cannot guarantee that these back up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency 
should we experience a prolonged failure  it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
in particular  should a significant service interruption occur  our ongoing customers may choose a different provider  and our reputation may be damaged  reducing our attractiveness to new customers 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
if failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cables  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited  which could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
our communications facilities include an undersea fiber optic cable that carries a large portion of our internet voice and data traffic to and from the contiguous lower states 
we completed construction of aulp west in june that provides an alternative backup communications facility 
if a failure of both sides of the ring of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities  some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
if a failure occurs in our satellite communications systems  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited 
we serve many rural and remote alaska locations solely via satellite communications 
each of our c and ku band satellite transponders is backed up on the same spacecraft with multiple backup transponders 
the primary spacecraft we use to provide voice  data and internet services to our rural alaska customers is panamsat s galaxy xr  but we also lease capacity on two other spacecraft for services we provide  ses americom s amc and amc on galaxy xr  we use c band transponders 
galaxy xr experienced a failure august  of its secondary xenon ion propulsion system xips that maintains the satellite s proper orbital position 
the primary xips failed in february the satellite is now using its backup bi propellant thrusters to maintain its orbital position 
these thrusters are a space flight proven technology 
the failure of the primary and secondary xips had no short term impact on service to our customers 
panamsat  the owner and operator of galaxy xr  believes the satellite has sufficient fuel to continue normal operations until april the terms of our galaxy xr transponder purchase agreement extends through march panamsat intends to replace the satellite before its estimated end of life 
we purchased a warranty with the original agreement to cover a loss of this nature 
we have had an agreement in place that provides backup transponder capacity on the galaxy xiii satellite in the event of a catastrophic failure of galaxy xr 
if such a failure occurs  service may not be fully restored for up to a week or longer due to the time necessary to redirect earth station antennae 
we also own one ku band satellite transponder on the same primary spacecraft galaxy xr that provides our c band service 
in the event of total primary spacecraft failure  we believe we would be able to restore our ku band transponder traffic on galaxy xiii  although no pre arrangement for its backup is currently in place 
we also lease approximately megahertz of protected and backed up c band capacity on ses americom s amc spacecraft 
ses americom s amc is the backup spacecraft for amc we also lease certain c band transponder capacity on amc that can be preempted in the case of a satellite failure 
the services that are preempted would not be immediately restored should amc fail or be called up to provide restoration of another of ses americom s spacecraft 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply communications equipment 
if we do not obtain the necessary communications equipment  we will not be able to meet the needs of our customers 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply cable  internet  dlps and telephony related equipment 
if our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand 
we do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject  which could lead to the incurrence of uninsured liabilities that adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are self insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities  including our buried  under sea and above ground transmission lines 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities due to damage or loss to such facilities  our financial position  results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected 
new corporate governance rules impose increased costs and internal control assessment requirements on us 
the sarbanes oxley act of and rules subsequently implemented by the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  and the nasdaq national market have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
for example  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor attest to such evaluation 
we expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these rules and regulations  as well as increased legal and financial compliance costs 
we recently identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   we identified a material weakness resulting from an ineffective review of a new unified billing and provisioning system that we implemented in september please see our management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item a below for a more detailed description of this weakness and the steps that we have taken to correct it 
because our systems  processes and internal controls change over time  we cannot assure you that we will not identify other deficiencies in the future 
we must apply a direct value method to determine the fair value of our cable certificate assets for purposes of impairment testing on an annual basis 
impairment testing may result in a material  non cash write down of our cable certificate or goodwill assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we must test our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually 
on september   the sec issued sec staff announcement topic use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  requiring us to apply no later than january  a direct value method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill for purposes of impairment testing 
we must also recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets  if any  in the determination of fair value for impairment testing purposes 
our cable certificate assets are our only indefinite lived assets other than goodwill as of december  our cable certificate assets were originally valued and recorded using the residual method 
impairment testing of our cable certificate assets in future periods under statement of financial accounting standard no 
must use a direct value method pursuant to such sec staff announcement  which may result in a material  non cash write down of our cable certificate assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
our significant debt could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our senior notes 
we have and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
on december   we had total debt of approximately million 
our high level of debt could have important consequences  including the following use of a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our senior notes  the senior secured credit facility and our other debt  which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development expenditures and other business activities  current and future debt under our senior secured credit facility will continue to be secured  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the senior notes and our other debt  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 
in addition  a substantial amount of our debt bears interest at variable rates 
if market interest rates increase  variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements  which would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our current significant level of debt  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt 
we may be able to incur substantial debt in the future 
although the indenture governing the senior notes contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the substantial risks described above would intensify 
the terms of our debt impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on the senior notes 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains and or the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  make certain investments  create liens  allow restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us  sell assets  merge or consolidate with other entities  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the senior secured credit facility also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including  but not limited to  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and maximum annual capital expenditures 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
all of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations  and if such events occur  we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply 
a breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our senior notes and or the senior secured credit facility 
if there were an event of default under the indenture for the senior notes and or the senior secured credit facility  holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately 
additionally  if we fail to repay the debt under the senior secured credit facility when it becomes due  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility could proceed against certain of our assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries that we have pledged to them as security 
our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder 
a significant percentage of our voting securities are owned by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control stockholder decisions on very important matters 
as of december   our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of our combined outstanding class a and class b common stock  representing approximately of the combined voting power of that stock 
these shareholders can significantly influence  if not control  our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions  including mergers  substantial acquisitions and dispositions  and election of directors to the board 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   and other attacks or acts of war may adversely affect us 
the attacks of september   and subsequent events have caused instability in the local  national and international economies and markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  which could cause further instability in such economies and markets 
in addition  armed hostilities and further acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations or those of our customers 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  subsequent events and future developments may adversely affect our customers or their facilities or otherwise result in reduced demand from our customers for our services 
any of the foregoing could subject our operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

long distance services segment overview long distance services segment revenue represented of consolidated revenues in our provision of interstate and intrastate long distance services  and private line and leased dedicated capacity services accounted for of our total long distance services segment revenues during factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services segment revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers  usage volumes expressed as minutes of use  and the number of private lines and private networks in use 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy  the long distance services segment continues to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from voice to data and from fixed to mobile wireless continues 
our long distance services segment faces significant competition from at t alascom  long distance resellers  and local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different business segment services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
on july  mci and substantially all of its active united states subsidiaries  on a combined basis a major customer  filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court 
on july   the united states bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement for pre petition amounts owed to us by mci and affirmed all of our existing contracts with mci 
mci emerged from bankruptcy protection on april  the remaining pre petition accounts receivable balance owed by mci to us after this settlement was million which we have used and will continue to use as a credit against amounts payable for services purchased from mci 
after settlement  we began reducing the mci credit as we utilized it for services otherwise payable to mci 
we have accounted for our use of the mci credit as a gain contingency  and  accordingly  are recognizing a reduction of bad debt expense as services are provided by mci and the credit is realized 
during and we realized approximately million and million  respectively  of the mci credit against amounts payable for services received from mci 
the remaining unused mci credit totaled approximately  at december  the credit balance is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as we are recognizing recovery of bad debt expense as the credit is realized 
in we renewed our agreement to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to mci through december with five one year automatic extensions to december the amendment includes new rates mandated by the consolidated appropriations act for fiscal year signed into law december  and effective january  which will result in rate decreases of per year tariff rates through  at which time rates will be contractually set 
in january verizon communications  inc and mci  our major customer  completed their merger 
while this merger has not had a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity  we are unable to predict the long term outcome this merger will have upon us 
however  given the materiality of mci s revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our common carrier customers by their customers 
pricing pressures  new program offerings  business failures  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by our other common carrier customers 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures  consistent with federal law 
additionally  disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes 
however  given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity

the increase in message telephone service revenues from other common carriers was partially off set by a decrease in the average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting from one of our common carrier customer contracts

we had  and  active residential  commercial and governmental customers at december  and  respectively 
an active customer is a subscriber who has had calling activity during december and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the following a decrease in the total number of long distance services subscribers in the market resulting from customers substituting cellular phone  prepaid calling card  voip  and email usage for direct dial minutes  a seasonal decrease in the number of customers with calling activity in the seasonal decrease was mitigated in by customers enrollment in a certain calling plan  and non revenue affecting adjustments to our customer database resulting from the implementation of a new customer service and provisioning information system 
the decrease in message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers in is primarily due to a decrease in the minutes carried for these customers and a decrease in the number of active residential  commercial  and governmental customers billed 
fiber optic cable system capacity lease revenue the increase in fiber optic cable system capacity lease revenues is primarily due to a lease of capacity on the aulp east fiber optic cable system resulting in increased monthly revenue of approximately  starting in july and the resolution of a billing matter with a certain customer in which resulted in revenue recognition of  the increase is partially off set by rate decreases in as compared to and disconnection of a customer in may long distance services segment cost of goods sold long distance services segment cost of goods sold decreased to million in primarily due to the following in november  we received million upon the settlement of four separate claims with at t and at t alascom  inc alascom pursuant to a master agreement  recognition of a  refund received in from a vendor due to a rate overcharge in and  reduced access costs resulting from the distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for originating and terminating interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows  and we performed an analysis of circuit costs directly contributing to long distance services segment and broadband services revenues and  as a result  decreased the allocation of cost of goods sold to the long distance services segment by million in broadband services cost of goods sold included in the all other category was increased an equal amount in the decrease in long distance services segment cost of goods sold is partially off set by the following a increase in minutes carried to billion minutes in  receipt of a million refund in from an intrastate access cost pool that previously overcharged us for access services  and a  credit received in from a vendor due to a rate overcharge 
long distance services segment operating income long distance services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the increase in long distance services segment revenue to million in and a decrease in long distance services segment cost of goods sold to million as discussed above 
the increase in long distance services segment operating income was partially off set by the following a increase in long distance services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million in  recognition of  as the long distance services segment s portion of the restructuring charge discussed below  and a increase in long distance services segment depreciation and amortization expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and our investment in long distance services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in cable services segment overview cable services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues in our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley and the kenai peninsula

we generate cable services segment revenues from four primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies and one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals and installation  cable modem services shared with our internet services segment  and advertising sales 
the primary factors that contribute to period to period changes in cable services segment revenues include average monthly subscription rates and pay per view buys  the mix among basic  premium and digital tier services  the average number of cable television and cable modem subscribers during a given reporting period  set top box utilization and related rates  revenues generated from new product offerings  and sales of cable advertising services 
we increased rates charged for certain cable services in eleven communities  including three of the state s four largest population centers  anchorage  the matanuska susitna valley  and fairbanks 
the rate increases are primarily effective in january and increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment

a digital programming tier subscriber is defined as one digital programming tier of service delivered to an address or separate subunits thereof regardless of the number of outlets or digital programming tiers purchased 
digital programming tier subscribers are a sub set of basic subscribers 
a cable modem subscriber is defined by the purchase of cable modem service regardless of the level of service purchased 
if one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points  each access point is counted as a subscriber 
cable modem subscribers may also be basic subscribers though basic cable service is not required to receive cable modem service 
the increases in digital programming tier subscribers and cable modem subscribers are primarily due to customers migrating to bundled product offerings that include digital programming and cable modem service 
the components of cable services segment revenues are as follows amounts in thousands year ended december  percentage change programming services cable modem services cable services segment s allocable share equipment rental and installation fees advertising sales other total cable services segment revenue average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in the increase in programming services revenue is primarily due to an increase in basic and digital programming tier subscribers in the increase in cable services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenue is primarily due to growth in cable modem subscribers 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the percentage of cable modem revenues allocated to our cable services segment of approximately  the decrease in the allocation primarily resulted from excluding revenues from certain features from allocable revenues 
the increase in equipment rental and installation fees revenue is primarily caused by the increased use of digital distribution technology 
the decrease in advertising sales revenue in is primarily caused by olympic and political advertising in that did not recur in cable services segment cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to a  refund received in from a supplier retroactive to august  an arrangement with a supplier in which we earned a  rebate in upon us meeting a specified goal  and programming cost increases in for certain of our cable programming service offerings 
cable services segment operating income cable services segment operating income decreased to million from to primarily due to the following the increase in cost of goods sold to million in described above  a increase in cable services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million in primarily due to an increase in labor costs and contract labor and contract services expenses  recognition of  as the cable services segment s portion of the restructuring charge discussed further below  and a increase in cable services segment depreciation and amortization expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in cable services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and our investment in cable services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the decrease in cable services segment operating income was partially off set by the increase in cable services segment revenues to million in described above

local access services segment overview local access services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues in we generate local access services segment revenues from three primary sources business and residential basic dial tone services  business private line and special access services  and business and residential features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services segment revenues include the average number of business and residential subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and the universal service program 
our local access services segment faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from alascom in anchorage for residential services 
alascom has received certification from the rca to provide local access services in fairbanks and juneau 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different business segment services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
in april we successfully launched our dlps deployment utilizing our anchorage coaxial cable facilities 
this service delivery method allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access service to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
we plan to continue to deploy additional dlps lines during the year ended december  on september  and again on february   the rca issued orders granting us certification to serve the service areas of ketchikan public utilities  cordova telephone cooperative  copper valley telephone cooperative  matanuska telephone cooperative  the glacier state area served by acs of the northland  wrangell  petersburg  sitka  seward  bethel and nome 
we plan to offer service in these new areas using a combination of methods 
to a large extent  we plan to use our existing cable network to deliver local services 
where we do not have cable plant  we may use wireless technologies and resale of other carrier s services 
we may lease portions of an existing carrier s network or seek wholesale discounts  but our application is not dependent upon access to either unbundled network elements unes of the ilec s network or wholesale discount rates for resale of ilec services 
on june   the rca issued a comprehensive decision setting forth new rates for unes  resale  and terms and conditions for interconnection in the anchorage arbitration 
significantly  the rca raised the loop rate in anchorage to but subsequently reduced the loop rate on reconsideration to 
the rca also issued other various arbitration rulings adverse to us  including adopting acs non recurring and collocation cost models 
on december   the commission issued a final order approving an interconnection agreement 
we have appealed various commission arbitration rulings 
on september   the acs subsidiary serving anchorage filed a petition with the fcc  seeking forbearance from the requirement that it provide access to unes  and that to the extent it voluntarily did so  that the pricing provisions of the act would not apply 
we filed our opposition on january   and replies are due on february  the fcc is required under statute to issue a decision by september   or on its own motion  in an additional days 
if a decision is not issued within the required timeframe  the petition is deemed granted 
the ability to obtain unes is an important element of our local exchange and exchange access services business  and the outcome of this proceeding could result in a change in our ability to access segments of the anchorage market via the facilities of the ilec and the cost of doing so 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its impact on us  however  our net cost of providing local telephone services in anchorage could be materially adversely affected by an adverse decision 
by letter  submitted also to the rca  on january   we made a bona fide request for interconnection for the purposes of local access competition with mta  under the provisions of the telecom act 
we submitted this request to mta on the grounds that it waived its rural exemption under the terms of section f c when it launched its new video service through its wholly owned subsidiary mta vision  inc in competition with our cable television service 
mta  however  refused to comply with the negotiation and arbitration provisions under the act claiming that it still retains a rural exemption 
we filed a complaint with the rca to resolve this dispute  and the rca conducted a public hearing on the matter on october  on february   the rca released a ruling that mta s rural exemption for the areas served by mta vision  inc had been lifted and that we could negotiate and arbitrate interconnection with mta 
we tendered a new interconnection request to mta on february  and proceeded with such negotiations 
negotiations were unsuccessful and an arbitration was requested on july  following our request for arbitration  mta filed a petition with the rca for a suspension or modification of its section c obligation to provision unes as well as its other c obligations as they related to unes 
the petition did not effect mta s obligation to provide resale at wholesale rates under section c 
the rca further granted a stay of the arbitration proceeding pending the outcome of mta s petition 
on december  the rca granted mta s petition for a three year period and arbitration as to mta s remaining obligations recommenced 
we have appealed the rca s suspension and modification decision 
the arbitration was completed under the provisions of the telecom act in january on january  an interconnection agreement by arbitration was submitted to the rca for approval 
such approval was granted on february  we intend to commence local service entry into the mat su valley during on may  we tendered an interconnection request to the city of ketchikan d b a ketchikan public utilities kpu  which had been authorized by the rca to provide video programming services through its kpu commvision division on april  under the terms of section f c of the telecommunications act of kpu s current rural exemption from negotiation will be forfeited if  and when  kpu commences offering video programming 
on june   we entered into a stipulation with kpu recognizing that kpu will forfeit its rural exemption and negotiations for interconnection will commence when kpu commences offering video programming 
local access services segment revenues and cost of goods sold selected key performance indicators for our local services segment follow december  percentage change total lines in service dlps lines in service a line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network 
we estimate that our and total lines in service represent a statewide market share of approximately and  respectively 
our access line mix follows december  residential customers business customers internet access customers at december  and approximately and  respectively  of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
at december  and approximately of our lines are provided using the une platform delivery method 
local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to the following growth in the average number of lines in service  and million increase in support from the universal service program 
local access services segment cost of goods sold decreased to million in primarily due to cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of dlps lines in the decrease in local access services segment cost of goods sold is partially off set by growth in the average number of lines in service and the increased costs resulting from the rca s anchorage une arbitration settlement order in june which increased the une lease rate payable to acs from to per line per month beginning on june  additionally  the une lease rates payable to acs in fairbanks and juneau increased from to and to  respectively  as of january  local access services segment operating loss local access services segment operating loss decreased to million from to primarily due to the increase in revenue to million in discussed above and the decrease in cost of goods sold to million discussed above 
the decrease in operating loss was partially off set by the following a increase in local access services segment selling  general and administrative expenses to million in primarily due to an increase in interconnect rates resulting from a renewed anchorage interconnection agreement beginning in november and increased labor costs  recognition of  as the local access services segment s portion of the restructuring charge discussed further below  and a increase in local access services segment depreciation and amortization expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in local access services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and our investment in local access services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the local access services segment operating results are negatively affected by the allocation of all of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating loss would have improved by approximately million and million in and  respectively and the long distance services segment operating income would have been reduced by equal amounts 
internet services segment overview internet services segment revenues represented of consolidated revenues in we generate internet services segment revenues from three primary sources access product services  including commercial  internet service provider  and retail dial up access  network management services  and internet services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenue a portion of cable modem revenue is also recognized by our cable services segment 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in internet services segment revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly subscription rates  the amount of bandwidth purchased by large commercial customers  and the number and type of additional premium features selected 
marketing campaigns continue to be deployed targeting residential and commercial customers featuring bundled products 
our internet offerings are bundled with various combinations of our long distance  cable  and local access services segments offerings and provide free or discounted basic or premium internet services 
value added premium internet features are available for additional charges 
we compete with a number of internet service providers in our markets 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing internet services allows us to be competitive in providing those services 
internet services segment revenues and cost of goods sold selected key performance indicators for our internet services segment follow december  percentage change cable modem subscribers dial up subscribers total internet subscribers total internet subscribers are defined by the purchase of internet access service regardless of the level of service purchased 
if one entity purchases multiple internet access service points  that entity is included in our total internet subscriber count at a rate equal to the number of access points purchased 
a subscriber with both cable modem and dial up service is included once as a cable modem subscriber 
a dial up subscriber is defined by the purchase of dial up internet service regardless of the level of service purchased 
if one entity purchases multiple dial up service access points  each access point is counted as a subscriber 
the decrease in dial up subscribers is primarily due to subscribers converting to our cable modem service and non revenue affecting adjustments to our customer database resulting from the implementation of a new customer service and provisioning information system 
total internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to a increase in its allocable share of cable modem revenues to million in as compared to the increase in cable modem revenues is primarily due to growth in cable modem subscribers and a decrease in the percentage of cable modem revenues allocated to our cable services segment resulting in a  increase in the internet services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenues 
the decrease in the allocation primarily resulted from removing certain features from the allocation calculation 
additionally  in the internet services segment sold services to broadband services included in the all other category and all of the revenue was eliminated from the internet services segment 
in broadband services and internet services are operating under a revenue share agreement that has resulted in an allocation of revenue between the internet services segment and the all other category 
internet services segment revenue would have been million and million in and  respectively  if the change in the external revenue distribution had not occurred 
internet services cost of goods sold increased to million in associated with increased internet services segment revenues 
internet services segment operating income internet services segment operating income increased to million from to primarily due to the increase in internet services segment revenues to million in as described above 
the operating income increase is partially off set by the following the increase in cost of goods sold to million as described above  a  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to million  recognition of  as the internet services segment s portion of the restructuring charge discussed further below  and a increase in internet services segment depreciation and amortization expense to million in as compared to primarily due to our investment in internet services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and our investment in internet services segment equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in all other overview revenues reported in the all other category as described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements include our broadband services  managed services  product sales  and cellular telephone services 
revenues included in the all other category represented of total revenues in we lease a portion of our mile fiber optic system capacity that extends from prudhoe bay to valdez via fairbanks  and provide management and maintenance services for this capacity to a significant customer 
the telecommunications service agreement is for fifteen years and may be extended for up to two successive three year periods and  upon expiration of the extensions  one additional year 
on march   the lessee announced that they had signed a contract with a competitor to build a microwave system to run parallel with our fiber optic cable system 
the lessee may utilize the microwave system in place of or in addition to our fiber optic cable system 
we have received notice from the lessee of their intent to amend our agreement 
we have agreed with the lessee that the agreement may be canceled by either party with days written notice 
revenue associated with this agreement totals approximately million per year 
we are unable to predict the financial impact of this event on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
however  we believe that operating income from sales or leases of capacity and provision of other services on this fiber optic cable system to other customers will partially offset operating income reductions that may result if our contract is changed or cancelled 
all other revenues and cost of goods sold all other revenues decreased to million in primarily due to million earned in from an equipment sale and installation project and a million decrease in product sales revenue primarily due to the sale of products to certain customers in that did not recur in the decrease in all other revenues is partially off set by a increase in managed services revenues to million primarily due to special project revenue earned in for services sold to two customers and a increase in revenues from our cellular telephone services to million resulting from increased promotion of our digital cellular telephone service 
all other revenues would have decreased from million in to million in if we had not changed the allocation of external revenue between our internet services segment and broadband services 
in all of a certain revenue stream was retained by broadband services and the associated internal cost of goods sold purchased from the internet services segment was eliminated from the all other category 
in broadband services and internet services operate under a revenue share agreement that has resulted in an allocation of the revenue between the internet services segment and the all other category 
all other cost of goods sold increased to million in primarily due to increased costs associated with managed services and cellular telephone services revenues 
the increase in all other cost of goods sold is partially off set by million in costs in associated with an equipment sale and installation project and a million decrease in costs associated with product sales revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in primarily due to a million increase in labor and health insurance costs resulting from an increased number of employees during the majority of as compared to and a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual 
the increase is partially off set by a million write off in of previously capitalized mobile wireless network costs upon finalization of a long term distribution agreement 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses without a proportional increase in revenues 
restructuring charge on august  we committed to a reorganization plan to more efficiently meet the demands of technological and product convergence by realigning along customer lines rather than product lines 
effective january  we will be reorganized under consumer  commercial  network access and managed broadband segments  replacing the long distance  cable  local access and internet services segments 
the reorganization plan included integration of several functions resulting in the layoff of employees by november  in we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million for workforce reduction costs across all functions 
the restructuring charge has been allocated to our reportable segments as follows amounts in thousands reportable segment long distance services cable services local access services internet services all other total restructuring charge our estimate of the total costs to be incurred under this plan is million 
bad debt expense recovery bad debt expense recovery increased approximately to a net expense of million in the increase is primarily due to allowances established for certain broadband services customers and a decrease in the realization of the mci credit through a reduction to bad debt expense  as further discussed above in long distance services segment overview  to million in from million in the remaining unused mci credit is  at december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to the following our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and a million increase in depreciation expense during due to the decreased useful life of our satellite transponders resulting from the failure of the propulsion system on the galaxy xr satellite 
other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to following as described further in liquidity and capital resources below  we finalized a amended and restated senior secured credit facility in august to replace our may  senior credit facility resulting in the following increased expenses we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in resulting from termination of our satellite transponder capital lease  we recognized approximately million in amortization and write off of loan and senior notes fees in because a portion of the amended senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the may  senior credit facility  and an increase in interest expense of approximately million in due to an increase in the outstanding balance owed on the new facility 
an increase in interest expense of approximately million in on our new senior notes due to an increase in the outstanding balance owed  and an increase in interest expense of approximately million in due to construction period interest expense capitalization in partially offsetting the increases described above were the following decreased interest rates on our senior credit facility and senior notes in as compared to  in we paid bond call premiums totaling million to redeem our old senior notes  and as a result of redeeming our old senior notes we recognized million in unamortized old senior notes fee expense in income tax expense income tax expense was million in and million in the change is primarily due to an increase in income tax expense in resulting from a true up of the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated primarily with fixed assets and net operating loss carryforwards 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in due to adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities balances in partially offsetting this decrease were increases in nondeductible entertainment expenses in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we utilized federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million in we estimate that we will utilize federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of million to million in our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview of revenues and cost of goods sold total revenues increased from million in to million in all of our segments and all other services contributed to the increase in total revenues

this fiber optic cable system is a spur off of a trans pacific fiber optic cable system owned by another group 
we used our owned capacity to carry traffic to and from alaska and the lower states 
the section of the north pacific cable in which we owned capacity was taken out of service in january due to a billing dispute between at t and the owner of the trans pacific cable system causing us to re route certain of our traffic 
we were relieved of all future obligations required by our purchase agreement and ceased payment of maintenance and vessel standby costs totaling approximately  per year that would otherwise be payable over the remaining life of the system 
the aulp west fiber optic cable system we built was put into service in june and provides us with route diversity and redundancy in excess of that previously provided by the north pacific cable

the increases are partially off set by a million increase in accrued payroll primarily due to an increased accrual for company wide success sharing bonus costs 
net receivables increased  from december  to december  primarily due to the following an increase in trade receivables from our residential  commercial and governmental message telephone service customers resulting from the implementation of a new customer service and provisioning information system 
after our september  implementation we delayed the issuance of some customer invoices 
our bill processing returned to normal in december and we expect the net receivables balance to decrease accordingly  an increase in trade receivables for broadband services provided to hospitals and health clinics  and an increase in the universal service program trade receivable 
the increase was partially off set by the timing of payments on trade receivables from a certain large customer and receipt of payment in for a special project included in net receivables at december  senior notes we have outstanding senior notes of million at december  we pay interest of on the senior notes and they are due in the senior notes are carried on our consolidated balance sheet net of the unamortized portion of the discount  which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the senior notes

the premium to redeem our old senior notes was million excluding interest cost of million and was recognized as a loss on early extinguishment of debt  a component of other income expense  during the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations 
semi annual interest payments of approximately million were paid in february and august the next semi annual interest payment is due february we were in compliance with all senior notes loan covenants at december  amended senior credit facility we have an outstanding amended senior credit facility of million at december  on august  our april senior credit facility was amended and restated 
the amended senior credit facility includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
our term loan is fully drawn and we have letters of credit outstanding totaling million at december   which leaves million available to draw under the revolving credit facility if needed 
we have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility in our amended senior credit facility is due in proceeds from the amendment were used to pay down our previous senior credit facility and to pay off our satellite transponder capital lease with the remainder used to pay financing fees 
outstanding principal of million on the satellite transponder capital lease was repaid  and we incurred a million charge due to the early termination of the capital lease which is classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations 
the amended senior credit facility decreased the interest rate on the term loan from libor plus to libor plus 
the interest rate on the revolving portion of the previous senior credit facility was libor plus a margin dependent upon our total leverage ratio as defined ranging from to 
the amended senior credit facility reduced the revolving credit facility interest rate to libor plus the following applicable margin dependent upon our total leverage ratio as defined total leverage ratio as defined applicable margin but but the commitment fee we are required to pay on the unused portion of the commitment was reduced to 
the amended senior credit facility increased our allowed total leverage ratio as defined limit to and our senior debt ratio as defined limit to our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined must be less than the amendment was a substantial modification of our april senior credit facility and we therefore recognized million in amortization and write off of loan and senior notes fees during the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations 
deferred loan fees of  were determined not to be a substantial modification and continue to be amortized over the life of the amended senior credit facility

our capital expenditures requirements in excess of approximately million per year are largely success driven and are a result of the progress we are making in the marketplace 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for maintenance of existing facilities  growth of our long distance  local exchange  cable and internet facilities  improving network integrity  continuing deployment of dlps  adding new products  and introducing new facilities and automation to reduce costs 
to ensure the necessary equipment is available to us as we expand our dlps service delivery method we have entered into an agreement to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters and other vendor equipment

the repurchase of our series b preferred stock was not part of our buyback program discussed below 
gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of our class a and class b common stock in order to reduce our outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 
our board of directors authorized us and we obtained permission from our lenders for up to million of repurchases through december  we are authorized to continue our stock repurchases of up to million per quarter indefinitely  to purchase an additional million during the six months ended june   and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares 
if stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases 
during the year ended december  we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock at a cost of approximately million 
we expect to continue the repurchases for an indefinite period subject to the availability of free cash flow  availability under our credit facilities  and the price of our class a and class b common stock 
the repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of sec rule b other expenditures we have an agreement with alaska airlines  inc alaska airlines to offer our residential and business customers who make qualifying purchases from us the opportunity to accrue mileage awards in the alaska airlines mileage plan

the agreement has a remaining commitment at december  totaling million 
we agreed to invest approximately million in exchange for a majority equity interest in alaska digitel  a small alaska pcs provider 
the existing owners will retain a minority ownership interest and voting control of alaska digitel 
the exact percentage and dollar amounts for our interest in alaska digitel will vary in proportion to the amount the existing owners elect to retain  but we expect to own between and after completion of the transaction 
the transaction is based on a post closing enterprise valuation of million for alaska digitel 
we will fund the transaction from cash on hand  by drawing down additional debt  or a combination of the two 
mta filed a petition with the fcc against our application in february the digitel transaction requires certain regulatory approvals and we are uncertain when it will close 
the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing under acceptable terms and conditions 
we believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity and capital requirements  and fixed charges during the upcoming year through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
new accounting standards for a discussion of our new accounting standards see note ai in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the universal service administration company usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount as required by sfas no 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
our cable certificate and goodwill assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets and because of the significance of our cable certificate and goodwill assets to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual and quarterly impairment analyses and quarterly evaluations of remaining useful lives are critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we estimate unbilled long distance services segment cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we determined that approximately million of the acquired net operating losses would not be utilized for income tax purposes  and elected with our december  income tax returns to forego utilization of such acquired losses 
deferred tax assets were not recorded associated with the foregone losses and  accordingly  no valuation allowance was provided 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  share based payments  and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  although outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice and data telecommunication and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues 
in fiscal the state of alaska reported that oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on january  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices  the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
every change in the price per barrel of oil is forecasted to result in an approximately million change in the state s fiscal revenue 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized  the constitutional budget reserve fund will be depleted in the date the constitutional budget reserve fund is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
a competing natural gas pipeline through canada has also been proposed 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
either project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and could provide a substantial stimulus to the alaska economy 
in october both houses of congress passed and the president signed legislation allowing loan guarantees of up to billion  certain favorable income tax provisions and tax credits  and expedited permitting and judicial review for the construction of an alaska natural gas pipeline 
to support the construction of a natural gas pipeline  the governor of the state of alaska has announced that he believes the state must assume some level of shipper risk  serve as an equity partner or both 
the state of alaska is in contract negotiations with conocophillips  bp and exxonmobil to construct a natural gas pipeline 
the state of alaska has announced that it reached an agreement with conocophillips  bp and exxonmobil on the base fiscal contract terms 
ultimate approval of any contract is uncertain as it must be approved by the alaska legislature 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project may have a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements and the alaska economy 
the system is a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the system includes deployment of up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract in for test bed facilities 
the contract is reported to contain basic requirements and various options that could amount to million in construction  or possibly more  if all items are executed 
construction began on the fort greely test bed in the first ground based missile interceptor was placed in an underground silo on july  the missile defense agency is reported to expect to continue emplacing interceptors in tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows are located in the municipality of anchorage  are located in the fairbanks north star borough  are located in the matanuska susitna borough  are located in the kenai peninsula borough  are located in the city and borough of juneau  and the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market  even with a reduced level of royalties 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
seasonality long distance services segment revenues primarily those derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
the cable  local access and internet services segments do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is also hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with our certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations other total contractual obligations for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our amended senior credit facility and on our senior notes 
interest on amounts outstanding under our amended senior credit facility is based on variable rates and therefore the amount is not determinable 
our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through august for a discussion of our senior notes see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
for discussion of our amended senior credit facility see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include a remaining commitment to purchase a certain number of outdoor  network powered multi media adapters  indoor multi media adapters  cable modems  and cable modem termination systems of million and a remaining million commitment for our alaska airlines agreement as further described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the contracts associated with these commitments are non cancelable 
purchase obligations also include open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  the open purchase orders are cancelable 
other consists of our commitment to acquire a substantial equity interest in alaska digitel for approximately million as further described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory developments see part i item business  regulation  franchise authorizations and tariffs for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
audit committee the audit committee  composed entirely of independent directors as such term is prescribed by nasdaq stock market rule a  meets periodically with our independent auditors and management to review our financial statements and the results of audit activities 
the audit committee  in turn  reports to the board of directors on the results of its review and recommends the selection of independent auditors 
the audit committee has approved the independent auditor to provide the following services audit audit of financial statements filed with the sec  quarterly reviews  comfort letters  consents  review of registration statements  accounting consultations  audit related employee benefit plan audits and accounting consultation on proposed transactions  and income tax services review of corporate and partnership income tax returns  and consultations regarding income tax matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our amended senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in  of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
