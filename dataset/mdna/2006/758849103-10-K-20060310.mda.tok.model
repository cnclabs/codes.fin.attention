item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and operating philosophy regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in our primary operating and investment goal is long term growth in earnings per share and total shareholder return  which we hope to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning  operating and developing high quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
we own  manage  lease  acquire  and develop shopping centers through our operating partnership  regency centers  lp rclp  in which we currently own approximately of the outstanding operating partnership units 
regency s operating  investing and financing activities are generally performed by rclp  its wholly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures with third parties 
currently  we operate and manage a real estate investment portfolio that totals billion at cost before depreciation with shopping centers in states and the district of columbia  including approximately billion in real estate assets composed of shopping centers owned by unconsolidated joint ventures in states and the district of columbia 
portfolio information is presented a on a combined basis  including unconsolidated joint ventures combined basis  b on a basis that excludes the unconsolidated joint ventures consolidated properties and c on a basis that includes only the unconsolidated joint ventures unconsolidated properties 
we believe that providing our shopping center portfolio information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we own  including those that we partially own and for which we provide property and asset management services 
at december   our gross leasable area gla on a combined basis totaled million square feet and was leased 
the portfolio contains million square feet when anchored owned buildings are included 
the gla for the consolidated properties totaled million square feet and was leased  including shopping centers under construction and partially pre leased 
the gla for the unconsolidated properties totaled million square feet and was leased 
we earn revenues and generate operating cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to market leading grocers  and major retail anchors  as well as specialty side shop retailers  restaurants and outparcel tenants in our shopping centers 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers  and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering daily necessities and services 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy  rental rates and rental rate growth for regency  which we expect to sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty retailers  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers 
we have created a formal partnering process the premier customer initiative pci to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers 
the objective of pci is for regency to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s anchor  help to stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions and new shopping center development  where we acquire the land and construct the building 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors  and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process can require up to months  or longer  from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization of rental income  depending upon the size of the project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth programs  which should preserve our investment grade ratings 
our approach is founded on our self funding business model 
this model utilizes center recycling as a key component  which requires ongoing monitoring of each center to ensure that it meets our stringent quality standards 
properties that do not measure up to our standards are sold in combination with non core development sales 
these sale proceeds are re deployed into new  higher quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and more attractive returns 
joint venturing of shopping centers also provides us with a capital source for new development  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment  and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the joint ventures 
joint ventures grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from regency 
although selling properties to joint ventures reduces our ownership interest  we continue to share in the risks and rewards of centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
we have no obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures beyond our ownership interest percentage 
we have identified certain significant risks and challenges affecting our industry  and we are addressing them accordingly 
an economic downturn could result in declines in occupancy levels at our shopping centers  which would reduce our rental revenues  however  we believe that our investment focus on grocery and discount target and wal mart anchored shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will minimize the impact of a downturn in the economy 
increased competition from super centers such as wal mart and industry consolidation could result in grocery store closings 
we closely monitor the operating performance and tenants sales in our shopping centers that operate near super centers as well as those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition or business practice such as the video rental format 
a slowdown in the demand for new shopping centers could cause a corresponding reduction in our shopping center development program and likely reduce our future operating revenues and gains from development sales 
we believe that the presence of our development teams in key markets and their excellent relationships with leading anchor tenants will enable us to sustain our development program

of the stores noted above  we believe that stores will be acquired by super valu  stores will be acquired by the consortium  and all will continue to operate as either super valu or albertsons  although its possible that certain stores could be closed 
we will continue to monitor the progress of the sale 
liquidity and capital resources general we expect that cash generated from revenues  including gains from the sale of real estate  will provide the necessary funds on a short term basis to pay our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our shopping centers  and dividends to stockholders 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

we incurred capital expenditures of million  million and million to improve our shopping centers  we paid scheduled principal payments of million  million and million to our lenders on mortgage loans  and we paid dividends of million  million and million to our stockholders  respectively 
the increase in dividends of during was primarily related to a million equity offering as described below under equity capital transactions 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy are able to cancel their leases and close the related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
on february   winn dixie stores  inc filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we currently lease three stores to winn dixie  two of which are owned directly by us and one is owned in a joint venture 
our annualized base rent from winn dixie including our share of the joint venture is million 
winn dixie currently owes regency  in pre petition rent related to common area expense reimbursements  and is current on all rent post petition 
we are not aware at this time of the current or pending bankruptcy of any of our other tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of the total of our annual base rental revenues and our pro rata share of the base revenues of the unconsolidated properties

we intend to continue to grow our portfolio through new developments and acquisitions  either directly or through our joint venture relationships 
because development and acquisition activities are discretionary in nature  they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements 
capital necessary to complete developments in process will be funded from our line of credit and our capital recycling program as previously described 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of real estate  unused amounts available under our line of credit and cash reserves are adequate to meet short term and committed long term liquidity requirements 
shopping center developments  acquisitions and sales on a consolidated basis  we had projects under construction or undergoing major renovations at december   which  when completed  will represent an investment of million before the estimated reimbursement of certain tenant related costs and projected sales proceeds from adjacent land and out parcels of million 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on our investment on these projects of upon completion 
this average return on investment is approximately to basis points less than our experience in prior years and is the result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction 
while the average return on investment has decreased from historical experience  the company believes the return on a risk adjusted basis is very adequate because expected profit margins are well in excess of historic margins 
costs necessary to complete the current in process developments are estimated to be million and will likely be expended through the costs to complete these developments will be funded from the company s unsecured line of credit  which had million of available funding at december   and also from expected proceeds from the future sale of shopping centers as part of the capital recycling program described above 
our expected total investment in new developments increased at december  at december   we had consolidated projects under construction representing an investment at completion of million

critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussion and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
revenue recognition and tenant receivables tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy  and we estimate the recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables

if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized  or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses

valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable

the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality and demand for new retail stores 
if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we will write down the asset to fair value for held and used assets and to fair value less costs to sell for held for sale assets 
discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets statement  the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it can be reasonably certain that a sale will be consummated 
given the nature of all real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of statement prior to the sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are likely to close within the requirements set forth in statement the company also makes judgments regarding the extent of involvement it will have with a property subsequent to its sale  in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued 
consistent with statement  any property sold to an entity in which the company has significant continuing involvement most often joint ventures is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which the company sells to an unrelated third party  but retains a property or asset management function  is also not considered discontinued 
therefore  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties that the company  in its judgment  has no continuing involvement with are classified as discontinued 
investments in real estate joint ventures in addition to owning real estate directly  we invest in real estate through our co investment joint ventures 
joint venturing provides us with a capital source to

index to financial statements acquire real estate  and to earn our pro rata share of the net income from the joint ventures in addition to fees for services 
as asset and property manager  we conduct the business of the shopping centers held in the joint ventures in the same way that we conduct the business of our wholly owned shopping centers  therefore  the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the joint ventures and the fees that we earn 
we account for all investments in which we own or less and do not have a controlling financial interest using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities  and therefore  are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
major decisions  including property acquisitions and dispositions  financings  annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners 
income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate in order to qualify as a reit  as defined under the internal revenue code 
we are required to meet certain income and asset tests on a periodic basis to ensure that we continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
we evaluate the transactions that we enter into and determine their impact on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities

in june  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on issue no 
determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
this consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership 
the consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners  if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights 
whether the presumption of control is overcome is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances  for which the consensus provides additional guidance 
this consensus is currently applicable to us for new partnerships created in  and will be applicable to all partnerships beginning january  this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities  such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership

index to financial statements in march the fasb issued fin  accounting for asset retirement obligations as amended 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we are not currently aware of any asset retirement obligations beyond those currently recorded in the consolidated balance sheets which would have a material effect on our financial condition

 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion and generally  the approach is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values and pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however we elected early adoption effective january  as permitted by statement r  we have applied the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date

as permitted under statement and statement  we previously followed the accounting guidelines pursuant to opinion  for stock based compensation and furnished the pro forma disclosures as required under statement during and  we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options

 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no statement 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
statement amends opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset 
we determine whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon methods described in our critical accounting policies

table of contents 
index to financial statements shopping centers  and underground petroleum storage tanks ust s 
we believe that the tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations 
generally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to non chlorinated solvent systems 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance  where possible  on specific properties with known contamination  in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites 
we also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites and we are in the process of doing so 
we estimate the cost associated with these legal obligations to be approximately million 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material affect on regency s financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily related to the variable interest rate on the line and the refinancing of long term debt  which currently contain fixed interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we have no plans to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques

moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented above has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and actual interest rates
