because of the size and diversity of the company s installed merchant base for its gateway product  the payment processing segment does not have significant merchant concentration 
tds lightbridge provides its tds products and services to wireless carriers in the united states 
the tds business unit also offers services designed to screen  authenticate and approve users engaged in online transactions 
the company expects that a substantial portion of its tds revenues will continue to come from a relatively small number of telecommunications clients in  although the companies that comprise its largest clients in any given quarter may vary 
customer concentration is likely to continue to decline if revenues from payment processing services continue to grow 
the company s revenues  margins and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the actions of a single significant client 
a client may take actions that significantly affect us for reasons that the company cannot necessarily anticipate or control  such as reasons related to the client s financial condition  changes in the client s business strategy or operations  the introduction of alternative competing products or services  acquisitions or as the result of the perceived quality or cost effectiveness of our products or services 
in november  lightbridge announced that it expected that future revenues from at t wireless services inc at t wireless would decline significantly as a result of the acquisition of at t wireless by 
table of contents cingular wireless llc 
in march  at t inc and bellsouth corporation announced an agreement to merge the two companies which will streamline the ownership and operations of cingular wireless llc  which is jointly owned by the two companies 
as a result of the acquisition of at t wireless by cingular wireless llc  at t wireless s customer activations transitioned from lightbridge s system to cingular s internal system 
the company does not expect that at t wireless will be a significant customer in the company s services agreements with sprint and nextel expire december on august   the merger transaction between sprint and nextel was completed to form sprint nextel corporation sprint nextel 
following the merger  lightbridge decreased certain transaction fees to sprint nextel commencing in the third quarter of  and  as a result  it expects future revenues for sprint nextel to decrease in comparison to the historical levels for sprint and nextel when they were separate customers 
the company is unable to predict the long term effect of the merger and on its relationship with sprint nextel which represented approximately of total revenues during including  without limitation  the timing or extent of any reductions in applications processed or other services provided under our contracts with those customers or future price reductions 
it is possible that sprint  nextel or both could elect to not renew their agreements  to reduce the volume of products and services they purchase from the company  or to request other significant changes to the pricing or other terms in any renewal agreement 
a loss of sprint  nextel or both as a client  a decrease in orders by them or a change in the combination of products and services they obtain from us would adversely affect the company s revenues  margins and net income 
lightbridge has agreements with certain of its clients that provide for the purchase of various combinations of tds products and services including cas  risk management and teleservices over periods of one to three years 
although some of these agreements contain annual minimum payment requirements  such minimum payments are typically substantially less than the amount of revenue lightbridge has historically received from the particular client and  therefore  provide only limited assurance of future revenues 
lightbridge s client agreements also often permit changes in the combination of products and services purchased by the client during the term of the agreement 
such changes can affect the revenues  margins and net income that lightbridge achieves from quarter to quarter in its tds business 
lightbridge has agreements for its tds services with at t wireless  sprint  and nextel 
the agreements with sprint and nextel end in december the agreement with at t wireless extends through march  but the company does not expect to receive significant revenues from at t wireless in following the acquisition of at t wireless by cingular wireless  llc  which is not a client of the company and performs credit decisioning in house 
because lightbridge derives almost all of its tds revenues from telecommunications carriers  the demand for lightbridge s products and services is dependent  in major part  on the overall market demand for the products and services provided by telecommunications carriers 
in particular  lightbridge s tds business is dependent on the rate of new subscriber growth and the rate at which subscribers switch from one carrier to another  known as the churn rate 
accordingly  if the growth rate of the telecommunications industry continues to slow and the churn rate does not increase  sales of lightbridge s tds products and services will continue to decline 
tds revenues will also be affected by mergers or consolidations involving telecommunications carriers

in addition  many telecommunications carriers are providing  or can provide internally  products and services competitive with those lightbridge offers in these segments 
trends in the telecommunications industry  including greater consolidation and technological or other developments that make it simpler or more cost effective for carriers to provide certain services themselves  could affect demand for lightbridge s tds products or services 
these developments could make it more difficult for lightbridge to offer a cost effective alternative to a telecommunications carrier s own capabilities 
lightbridge believes that the principal competitive factors in the communications provider and online industries include the ability to identify and respond to client needs  timeliness  quality and breadth of product and service offerings  price  continuous availability of service  and technical expertise 
lightbridge believes that its ability to compete in these industries also depends in part on a number of factors outside its control  including the ability to hire and retain employees  the development of products and services by others that are competitive with lightbridge s products and services  the price at which others offer comparable products and services  and the extent of its competitors responsiveness to client needs 
government and industry specific regulation the federal communications commission fcc  under the terms of the communications act of  regulates interstate communications and use of the radio spectrum 
although lightbridge is not required to and does not hold any licenses or other authorizations issued by the fcc for its tds business segment  the domestic telecommunications carriers that constitute lightbridge s tds clients are regulated at both the federal and state levels 
federal and state regulation may decrease the growth of the telecommunications industry  affect the development of the wireless markets  limit the number of potential clients for lightbridge s tds services  impede lightbridge s ability to offer competitive services to the telecommunications market  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s tds business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
changing laws and regulations have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  significant changes in the industry  including the entrance of new competitors eg cable voice telephoning  and voice over internet protocol voip providers  consolidation of industry participants  the introduction of bundled wireless and wireline services and the introduction of wireless number portability wnp in november those changes have subjected  and could in turn continue to subject  lightbridge to increased pricing pressures  decreased demand for lightbridge s tds products and services  increased costs of doing business or other material adverse effects on lightbridge s tds business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the banking secrecy act  the usa patriot act of  and the homeland security act contain anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandate the implementation of various new regulations applicable to financial services companies  including obligations to monitor transactions and report suspicious activities 
the obligations under these acts which may apply directly or could be applied to lightbridge s financial services partners or to certain of its merchant services  require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices  procedures  and controls which may increase the company s costs and may subject the company to liability 
businesses that handle consumers funds  such as the company s payment processing business  are subject to numerous regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  ach processing  escrow  fair credit reporting  privacy of financial records and others 
state money transmitter regulations and federal anti money laundering and money services business regulations can also apply under some circumstances 
the application of many of these laws with regard to electronic commerce is currently unclear 
in addition  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet concerning matters such as taxes  pricing  content and distribution 
furthermore  the growth and development of the e commerce market may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional regulatory burdens on those companies  such as lightbridge  that provide services to online business 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations  or taxation requirements  may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for the company s products and services and increase the company s cost of doing business 
consumer protection laws in the areas of privacy  credit and financial transactions have been evolving rapidly at the state  federal and international levels 
as the electronic transmission  processing and storage of financial 
table of contents information regarding consumers continues to grow and develop  it is likely that more stringent consumer protection laws may impose additional burdens on companies involved in such transactions including  without limitation  modification of unauthorized disclosure of personal information of individuals 
uncertainty and new laws and regulations  as well as the application of existing laws to e commerce  could limit the company s ability to operate in its markets  expose the company to compliance costs fines and penalties  and substantial liability and result in costly and time consuming litigation 
in addition  privacy legislation including the gramm leach bliley act glba and regulations thereunder affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients across all segments as well as the company s ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
consumer legislation such as the fair credit reporting act fcra and equal credit opportunity act ecoa and state laws also affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients 
in the payment processing segment  the company is responsible to maintain compliance with industry security standards set forth by the credit card associations under pci  and ach processing rules and guidelines set forth by the national ach association nacha 
the securities and exchange commission sec and the national association of securities dealers  inc have also enacted regulations affecting corporate governance  securities disclosure or compliance practices 
the company expects these regulations to increase its compliance costs and to make some of its activities more time consuming 
proprietary rights lightbridge s success across all segments is dependent upon proprietary technology 
lightbridge has traditionally relied on a combination of copyrights  patents  trade secrets and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to establish and protect its rights in its software products and proprietary technology 
lightbridge protects the source code versions of its products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works  and has internal policies and systems designed to limit access to and require the confidential treatment of its trade secrets 
lightbridge software is provided either on an outsourced basis or under license agreements that grant clients the right to use  but contain various provisions intended to protect lightbridge s ownership and confidentiality of the underlying copyrights and technology 
lightbridge requires its employees and other parties with access to its confidential information to execute agreements prohibiting unauthorized use or disclosure of lightbridge s technology 
in addition  lightbridge s employees are required as a condition of employment to enter into confidentiality agreements with lightbridge 
lightbridge also relies on the law of trademarks to establish and protect rights in its products  services and brand names 
lightbridge currently has several issued us and foreign patents and applications pending in the us patent and trademark office and with certain foreign regulatory bodies 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that lightbridge s current patents or any future patents will provide meaningful protection to lightbridge 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by lightbridge to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of lightbridge s products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that lightbridge regards as proprietary 
existing copyright and trade secret laws and patents issued to lightbridge offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect lightbridge s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
lightbridge s competitive position may be affected by limitations on its ability to protect its proprietary information 
however  lightbridge believes that patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other legal protections are less significant to lightbridge s success than other factors  such as the knowledge  ability and experience of lightbridge s personnel  new product and service development  frequent product enhancements  customer service and ongoing product support 
certain technologies used in lightbridge s products and services are licensed from third parties 
lightbridge generally pays license fees on these technologies and believes that if the license for any such third party technology 
table of contents were terminated  it would be able to develop such technology internally or license equivalent technology from another vendor  although no assurance can be given that such development or licensing could be effected without significant delay or expense 
although lightbridge believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  the company expects to become a party to a pending lawsuit entitled net moneyin  inc v 
verisign  inc  et al  involving intellectual property infringement claims against businesses providing electronic payment gateway services 
the company has also received notices alleging that certain of its products or services may infringe on another party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert other infringement claims against lightbridge in the future or that any asserted or future claims will not be successful 
lightbridge could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights  which could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block lightbridge s ability to make  use  sell  distribute or market its products and services in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
in the event a claim relating to proprietary technology or information is asserted against lightbridge  lightbridge may seek licenses to such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance  however  that such a license could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to lightbridge 
the failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could preclude the sale  manufacture or distribution of lightbridge s products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
employees as of january   lightbridge had a total of employees  of which were full time and were part time or seasonal 
the number of personnel employed by lightbridge varies seasonally 
none of lightbridge s employees are represented by a labor union  and lightbridge believes that its employee relations are good 
the future success of lightbridge will depend in large part upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel can be strong  particularly for sales and marketing personnel  software developers and service consultants

risk factors if one or more of our major clients stops using our products or services or changes the combination of products and services it uses  our operating results would suffer significantly 
our tds revenues are concentrated among a few major clients 
our largest clients accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in the year ended december  and  respectively 
we have no significant merchant concentration in our payment processing business 
although our client concentration has declined  we expect that a substantial part of our revenues will continue to come from a relatively small number of clients for the foreseeable future 
consequently  our revenues  margins and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the actions of a single significant client 
a client may take actions that significantly affect us for reasons that we cannot necessarily anticipate or control  such as reasons related to the client s financial condition  changes in the client s business strategy or operations  the introduction of alternative competing products or services  acquisitions  or as the result of the perceived quality or cost 
table of contents effectiveness of our products or services 
our services agreements with sprint spectrum lp sprint  and nextel operations  inc nextel expire in december our services agreement with at t wireless services  inc at t wireless expires on april   but is subject to earlier termination upon twelve months notice and designated services upon notice 
in february  cingular wireless llc cingular announced an agreement to acquire at t wireless and in october  cingular announced that it had completed its merger with at t wireless 
in march  at t inc and bell south corporation announced an agreement to merge the two companies  which will streamline the ownership and operation of cingular wireless llc  which is jointly owned by the two companies 
cingular is not presently a client of lightbridge 
we do not expect that client to generate significant revenue in on august   the merger transaction between sprint and nextel was completed to form sprint nextel corporation sprint nextel 
following the merger we decreased certain transaction fees to sprint nextel commencing in the third quarter of  and  as a result  we expect our future revenues for sprint nextel to decrease in comparison to the historical levels for sprint and nextel when they were separate customers 
we are unable to predict the long term effect of the merger on our relationship with sprint nextel  which represented approximately of our total revenues in including  without limitation  the timing or extent of any reductions in applications processed or other services provided under our contracts with those clients or further price reductions 
it is possible that sprint  nextel or both could elect not to renew their agreements  to reduce the volume of products and services they purchase from us or to request significant changes to the pricing or other terms in any renewal agreement 
the loss of sprint  nextel or both  or any of our other major clients would cause sales to fall below expectations and materially reduce our revenues  margins and net income and adversely affect our business 
certain of our future revenues are uncertain because our clients may reduce the amounts of or change the combination of our products or services they purchase 
most of our communications client contracts extend for terms of between one and three years 
during the terms of these contracts  our communications clients typically may elect to purchase any of several different combinations of products and services 
the revenue that we receive for processing a transaction for such a client may vary significantly depending on the particular products and services used to process the transaction 
in particular  transactions handled through our teleservices group generally result in significantly higher revenue than transactions that are submitted and processed electronically  but also result in higher cost of revenues 
therefore  our revenues or margins from a particular client may decline if the client changes the combination of products and services it purchases from us 
to the extent our client contracts contain minimum purchase or payment requirements  these minimums are typically at levels significantly below actual or historical purchase or payment levels 
therefore  our current clients may not continue to utilize our products or services at levels similar to previous years or at all  and may not generate significant revenues in future periods 
if any of our major clients significantly reduces or changes the combination of products or services it purchases from us for any reason  our business would be seriously damaged 
historically  a majority of our revenues have been concentrated in the wireless telecommunications industry  which have experienced declining growth rates  consolidation and increasing pressure to control costs 
historically  we derived a majority of our revenues from companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  and we expect that wireless telecommunications companies will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenues in in recent years  the growth rate of the domestic wireless industry has slowed 
in addition  consolidation has affected the number of carriers to whom our products and services can be marketed and sold  and competition among wireless carriers has continued to increase  resulting in heightened efforts by carriers to control costs 
many of our carrier clients have sought and received  and may in the future seek  pricing concessions when they renew their services agreements with us or at other times  which would adversely affect our revenues  margins and net income 
in addition  certain of our carrier clients have sought bankruptcy protection in recent years  and we believe it is possible that additional clients may file for bankruptcy protection if current industry conditions continue 
bankruptcy filings by our clients or former clients such as worldcom  inc may prevent us from collecting 
table of contents some or all of the amounts owing to us at the time of filing  may require us to return some or all of any payments received by us within days prior to a bankruptcy filing and may also result in the termination of our service agreements 
as a result of the foregoing conditions  our success depends on a number of factors our ability to maintain our profit margins on sales of products and services to companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  the financial condition of our clients and their continuing ability to pay us for services and products  our ability to develop and market new or enhanced products and services to new and existing clients  continued growth of the domestic wireless telecommunications markets  and our ability to increase market penetration in the wireless telecommunications market 
we and our clients must comply with complex and changing laws and regulations 
government regulation influences our activities and the activities of our current and prospective clients  as well as our clients expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
businesses that handle consumers funds  such as our payment processing business  are subject to numerous state and federal regulations  including those related to banking  credit cards  electronic transactions and communication  escrow  fair credit reporting  privacy of financial records and others 
state money transmitter regulations and federal anti money laundering and money services business regulations can also apply under some circumstances 
the application of many of these laws with regard to electronic commerce is currently unclear 
in addition  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet concerning matters such as taxes  pricing  content and distribution 
if applied to us  any of the foregoing rules and regulations could require us to change the way we do business in a way that increases costs or makes our business more complex 
in addition  violation of some statutes may result in severe penalties or restrictions on our ability to engage in e commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our clients also include telecommunications companies that  to the extent that they extend consumer credit  may be subject to federal and state regulations 
in making credit evaluations of consumers  performing fraud screening or user authentication  our clients are subject to requirements of federal law  including the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act and the gramm leach bliley act and regulations thereunder  as well as state laws which impose a variety of additional requirements 
privacy legislation may also affect the nature and extent of the products or services that we can provide to clients as well as our ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
although most of the products and services we provide to the telecommunications industry  other than our profile service  are not directly subject to these requirements  we must take these extensive and evolving requirements into account in order to meet our clients needs 
in some cases  consumer credit laws require our clients to notify consumers of credit decisions made in connection with their applications for telecommunications services  and we have contracted with some of our clients  including sprint nextel  at t wireless  and dobson communications  inc  to provide such notices on their behalf 
our software has in the past contained  and could in the future contain  undetected errors affecting compliance by our clients with one or more of these legal requirements 
failure to properly implement these requirements in our products and services in a timely  cost effective and accurate manner could result in liability  either directly or as indemnitor of our clients  damage to our reputation and relationships with clients and a loss of business 
consumer protection laws in the areas of privacy  credit and financial transactions have been evolving rapidly at the state  federal and international levels 
as the electronic transmission  processing and storage of financial information regarding consumers continues to grow and develop  it is likely that more stringent consumer protection laws may impose additional burdens on companies involved in such transactions including  without limitation  notification of unauthorized disclosure of personal information of individuals 
uncertainty and new laws and regulations  as well as the application of existing laws  could limit our ability to operate in our markets  expose us to compliance costs  fines  penalties and substantial liability  and result in costly and time consuming litigation 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional regulatory burdens on companies that provide services to online 
table of contents business 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations  or taxation requirements may affect the ability to offer  or cost effectiveness of offering  goods or services online  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers  inc have also enacted regulations affecting our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
we expect these regulations to increase our compliance costs and to make some of our activities more time consuming 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to legal actions by regulatory authorities or private parties 
we may become a party to intellectual property infringement claims  which could harm our business 
from time to time  we have had and may be forced to respond to or prosecute other intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a client s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays  all of which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell or otherwise practice our intellectual property  whether or not patented or described in pending patent applications  or to further develop or commercialize our products in the us and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties claiming infringement by us of their intellectual property in order to settle these claims 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may not have terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  if we are forced to enter into a license agreement with terms that are unfavorable to us  our operating results would be materially harmed 
we may also be required to indemnify our clients for losses they may incur under indemnification agreements if we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others 
please refer to part i item  legal proceedings for a discussion of certain pending matters related to our intellectual property 
in connection with the sale of our ins business to verisign on june   we agreed to indemnify verisign for up to million in damages incurred for potential breaches of our intellectual property representations and warranties in the asset purchase agreement 
such representations and warranties extend for two years from the date of closing 
our future revenues may be uncertain because of reliance on third parties for marketing and distribution 
authorize 
net distributes its service offerings primarily through outside sales distribution partners 
authorize 
net s revenues are derived predominantly through these relationships with outside distribution partners 
in addition  our tds business has entered into a business alliance with verisign to assist us in penetrating the online transaction market for authentication services 
we intend to continue to market and distribute our current and future products and services through existing and other relationships both in and outside of the united states 
there are no minimum purchase obligations applicable to any existing distributor or other sales and marketing partners and we do not expect to have any guarantees of continuing orders 
failure by our existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners to generate significant revenues or our failure to establish additional distribution or sales and marketing alliances or changes in the industry that render third party distribution networks obsolete could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may be required to pay higher commission rates in order to maintain loyalty among our third party distribution partners  which may have a material adverse impact on our profitability 
in addition  distributors and other sales and marketing partners may become our competitors with respect to the products they distribute either by developing a competitive product themselves or by distributing a competitive offering 
for example  outside sales partners of authorize 
net products and services are permitted to and generally do market and sell competing products and services 
with respect to the tds business  verisign may elect to market or acquire alternative fraud and identity verification products for authentication services 
competition from existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products 

table of contents changes to credit card association and ach rules or practices could adversely impact our authorize 
net business 
our authorize 
net credit card payment gateway does not directly access the credit card associations 
as a result  we must rely on banks and their credit card processing providers to process our transactions 
nevertheless  as a payment gateway we must comply with the operating rules of the credit card associations 
the associations member banks set these rules  and the associations interpret the rules 
some of those member banks compete with authorize 
net 
visa  mastercard  american express or discover could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of existing rules which we might find difficult or even impossible to comply with  resulting in our inability to give customers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments 
if we were unable to provide a gateway for credit card transactions  our authorize 
net business would be materially and adversely affected 
in december  the payment card industry data security standard was created by major credit card companies to safeguard customer information 
visa  mastercard  american express  and other credit card associations mandate that merchants and service providers meet certain minimum standards of security when they store  process and transmit cardholder data 
our payment processing business must comply with this standard in order continue as an internet payment gateway 
changes to this standard may require us to invest significant resources in engineering and hardware in order to comply 
additionally  our payment processing business is required to be compliant with automated clearing house processing rules promulgated by the national ach association 
nacha could adopt new operating rules or interpretations of existing rules which we might find difficult or impossible to comply with  resulting in our inability to give customers the option of using the ach network for payment processing services  as well as significantly hinder our ability to utilize the ach network for our own billing and collection activities for our own services 
we could be subject to liability as a result of security breaches  service interruptions by cyber terrorists or fraudulent or illegal use of our services 
because some of our activities involve the storage and transmission of confidential personal or proprietary information  such as credit card numbers and social security numbers  and because we are a link in the chain of e commerce  security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible monetary damages 
cyber terrorists have periodically interrupted  and may continue to interrupt  our payment gateway services in attempts to extort payments from us or disrupt commerce 
our payment gateway services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes  including unauthorized use of credit cards or bank accounts  identity theft or merchant fraud 
we expect that technically sophisticated criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent our anti fraud systems 
if such fraud schemes become widespread or otherwise cause merchants to lose confidence in our services in particular  or in internet systems generally  our business could suffer 
in addition  the storage and transmission of confidential personal data  coupled with the large volume of payments that we handle for our clients makes us vulnerable to third party or employee fraud or other internal security breaches 
further  we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and fraud to address any problems they may cause 
our payment system may also be susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these uses may include illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  software and other intellectual property piracy  money laundering  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
despite measures we have taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  we cannot ensure that these measures will succeed 
in addition  regulations under the usa patriot act of may require us to revise the procedures we use to comply with the various anti money laundering and financial services laws 
our business could suffer if clients use our system for illegal or improper purposes or if the costs of complying with regulatory requirements increase significantly 
authorize 
net is compliant with visa s cardholder information security program and mastercard s site data protection standard 
additionally  authorize 
net is compliant with the credit card industry s pci security 
table of contents requirements 
however  there is no guarantee that we will maintain such compliance or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment system 
we have expended  and may be required to continue to expend  significant capital resources to protect against security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  service interruptions and fraud schemes and the failure to do so may disrupt our business  damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible monetary damages 
a failure of  error in or damage to our computer and telecommunications systems would impair our ability to conduct transactions  payment processing and support services and harm our business operations 
we provide tds and payment processing transaction services  as well as support services  using complex computer and telecommunications systems 
our business could be significantly harmed if these systems fail or suffer damage from fire  natural disaster  terrorism including cyber terrorism  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized access by hackers  electronic break ins  intrusions or attempts to deny our ability to deploy our services  computer viruses or similar events 
in addition  a growth of our client base  a significant increase in transaction volume or an expansion of our facilities may strain the capacity of our computers and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or system failure 
many of our agreements with telecommunications carriers contain level of service commitments  which we might be unable to fulfill in the event of a natural disaster  an actual or threatened terrorist attack or a major system failure 
errors in our computer and telecommunications systems may adversely impact our ability to provide the products and services contracted for by our clients 
we may need to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against or repair damage to our systems that occur as a result of malicious activities  cyber terrorism  natural disasters or human error  but these protections and repairs may not be completely effective 
our property and business interruption insurance and errors and omissions insurance might not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur as the result of these types of damage 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the demand for our payment processing products and services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of e commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure 
sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of the overall sales of goods and services in the economy 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and as a means to grow our business 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
it is also possible that the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  will continue to grow  and may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect on the internet and correspondingly on our business 
these factors would adversely affect usage of the internet  and lower demand for our products and services 
our reliance on suppliers and vendors could adversely affect our ability to provide our services and products to our clients on a timely and cost efficient basis 
we rely to a substantial extent on third parties to provide some of our equipment  software  data  systems and services 
in some circumstances  we rely on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers 
for example  our payment processing business requires the services of third party payment processors 
if any of these processors cease to allow us to access their processing platforms  our ability to process credit card payments would be severely impacted 
in addition  we depend on a single originating depository financial institution odfi partner to process ach transactions  and our ability to process these transactions would be severely impacted if we were to lose such partner for any reason 

table of contents our reliance on outside vendors and service providers also subjects us to other risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over quality  pricing and timing of delivery of components 
for example  in order to provide our credit verification service  we need access to third party credit information databases provided to us by outside vendors 
similarly  delivery of our activation services often requires the availability and performance of billing systems which are also supplied by outside vendors 
if for any reason we were unable to access these databases or billing systems  our ability to process credit verification transactions could be impaired 
in addition  our business is materially dependent on services provided by various telecommunications providers 
a significant interruption in telecommunications services including  without limitation  a power loss could seriously harm our business 
from time to time  we must also rely upon third parties to develop and introduce components and products to enable us  in turn  to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be able to obtain access  in a timely manner  to third party products and development services necessary to enable us to develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
we may not be able to obtain third party products and development services on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to replace third party products in the event such products become unavailable  obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions  which involve risks 
we acquired authorize 
net corporation in march of we may also make additional acquisitions in the future if we identify companies  technologies or assets that appear to expand or complement our core business 
acquisitions involve risks that could cause the actual results of any acquisitions we make to differ from our expectations 
if we are not able to make acquisitions  we may not be able to expand our business 
for example we may experience difficulty in integrating and managing acquired businesses successfully and in realizing anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner 
the need to retain existing clients  employees  and sales and distribution channels of an acquired company and to integrate and manage differing corporate cultures can also present significant risks 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
our acquisition of other businesses could significantly reduce our available cash and liquidity 
in other future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our shareholders or we may use our remaining cash  which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
this additional debt and amortization expense  as well as the potential impairment of any purchased goodwill  may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may also be required to make continuing investments in acquired products or technologies to bring them to market  which may negatively affect our cash flows and net income 
we may also incur additional costs relating to the integration  review and evaluation and enhancement of our internal controls for authorize 
net 
in addition  we may assume contingent liabilities that may be difficult to estimate and costs and liabilities associated with assumed litigation matters 
acquisitions may divert management s attention from our existing business and may damage our relationships with our key clients and employees 
acquisitions may also result in liabilities for claims not known at the time of acquisition as well as for assumed obligations 
the success of our business strategy is dependent on our ability to further penetrate into existing markets and to expand into new or complementary markets 
as part of our business strategy  we are seeking to further penetrate into existing markets and to expand our business into new markets or markets that are complementary to our existing businesses  with a focus on the 
table of contents payment processing business 
if we are not able to successfully expand our penetration into existing markets or into new markets  our financial results and future prospects may be harmed 
our ability to increase market penetration and enter new markets depends on a number of factors  including growth in our existing and targeted markets  our ability to provide products and services to address the needs of those markets  and competition in those markets 
if we do not continue to enhance our existing products and services  and develop or acquire new ones  we will not be able to compete effectively 
the industries in which we do business or intend to do business have been changing rapidly as a result of increasing competition  technological advances  regulatory changes and evolving industry practices and standards  and we expect these changes will continue 
current and potential clients have also experienced significant changes as the result of consolidation among existing industry participants and economic conditions 
in addition  the business practices and technical requirements of our clients are subject to changes that may require modifications to our products and services 
in order to remain competitive and successfully address the evolving needs of our clients  we must commit a significant portion of our resources to identify and anticipate emerging technological and market trends affecting the markets in which we do business  enhance our current products and services in order to increase their functionality  features and cost effectiveness to clients that are seeking to control costs and to meet regulatory requirements  develop or acquire new products and services that meet emerging client needs  such as products and services for the online market  modify our products and services in response to changing business practices and technical requirements of our clients  as well as to new regulatory requirements  integrate our current and future products with third party products  and create and maintain interfaces to changing client and third party systems 
we must achieve these goals in a timely and cost effective manner and successfully market our new and enhanced products and services to clients 
in the past  we have experienced errors or delays in developing new products and services and in modifying or enhancing existing products and services 
if we are unable to expand or appropriately enhance or modify our products and services quickly and efficiently  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we need to continue to improve or implement our procedures and controls 
requirements adopted by the sec in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of require annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting  and attestation of these systems by our independent public accounting firm 
in january  we re evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures for the first three quarters of fiscal and concluded  based upon management s january evaluation of those disclosure controls and procedures  that as of march  june  september  and december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not fully effective as of those dates to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching the company s disclosure control objectives 
specifically at december   we had material weaknesses in our procedures for income tax accounting and our ability to properly account and report complex transactions and we restated our financial results for the year ended december  and the quarterly periods ended march  june and september  to correct our reporting for income taxes 
in addition  in connection with the audit of our financial statements for  management identified an error in accounting and reporting the sale of the ins business in the statement of cash flows  which has been identified as a material weakness 
previously  we had evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of march and september  and found them effective to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching our disclosure control 
table of contents objectives 
however  our previous evaluation as of june  had identified a separate material weakness as a result of which adjustments were needed to properly account for the gain on the sale of our ins business 
please refer to part ii 
item a 
below for a discussion about controls and procedures 
we continue to evaluate such disclosure controls and procedures  and may modify  enhance or supplement them as appropriate in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with all of the new requirements 
any modifications  enhancements or supplements to our internal control systems or in documentation of such internal control systems could be costly to prepare or implement  divert attention of management or finance staff  and may cause our operating expenses to increase over the ensuing year 
our stock price may be adversely affected because of our conclusion that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective in our business may be harmed by errors in our software 
the software that we develop and license to clients  and that we also use in providing our transaction processing and contact center services  is extremely complex and contains hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code 
large  complex software systems such as ours are susceptible to errors 
the difficulty of preventing and detecting errors in our software is compounded by the fact that we maintain multiple versions of our systems to meet the differing requirements of our major clients  and must implement frequent modifications to these systems in response to these clients evolving business policies and technical requirements 
our software design  development and testing processes are not always adequate to detect errors in our software prior to its release or commercial use 
as a result  we have from time to time discovered  and may likely in the future discover  errors in software that we have put into commercial use for our clients  including some of our largest clients 
because of the complexity of our systems and the large volume of transactions they process on a daily basis  we sometimes have not detected software errors until after they have affected a significant number of transactions 
software errors can have the effect of causing clients that utilize our products and services to fail to comply with their intended credit or business policies  or to fail to comply with legal  credit card  and banking requirements  such as those under the ecoa  fcra  glba  nacha  sdp and pci 
such errors  particularly if they affect a major client  can harm our business in several ways  including the following we may suffer a loss of revenue if  due to software errors  we are temporarily unable to provide products or services to our clients  we may not be paid for the products or services provided to a client that contain errors  or we may be liable for losses or damages sustained by a client or its subscribers as a result of such errors  we may incur additional unexpected expenses to correct errors in our software  or to fund product development projects that we may undertake to minimize the occurrences of such errors in the future  we may damage our relationships with clients or suffer a loss of reputation within our industry  we may become subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny  and our clients may terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us or reduce the products and services they purchase from us 
our errors and omissions insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to software errors 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our initiatives to improve our software design and development processes may not be successful 
the development of our products has  in some cases  extended over a period of more than ten years 
this incremental development process has resulted in systems which are extremely complex 
systems of the size and complexity of ours are inherently difficult to modify and maintain 
we have implemented and are also evaluating changes in our product development  testing and control processes to improve the accuracy and timeliness of modifications that we make to our software  including the frequent modifications that we must make in response to changes in the business policies and technical requirements of our clients 
we believe that our initiatives to 
table of contents implement new product architecture and to improve our product development  test and control processes will be important to our future competitive position and success 
if we are not successful in carrying out these initiatives on a timely basis or in a manner that is acceptable to our clients  our business and future prospects could be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully manage operational changes 
over the last several years  our operations have experienced rapid growth in some areas and significant restructurings and cutbacks in others 
these changes have created significant demands on our executive  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
if we achieve future growth in our business  or if we are forced to make additional restructurings  we may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting systems 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully manage the future changes in our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall dramatically 
our common stock price could also fall dramatically if investors or public market analysts reduce their estimates of our future quarterly operating results  whether as a result of information we disclose  or based on industry  market or economic trends  or other factors 
our revenues are difficult to forecast for a number of reasons seasonal and retail trends affect our transaction revenues  in both our payment processing and tds businesses  as well as our other products and services 
transaction revenues historically have represented the majority of our total revenues 
as a result  our revenues can fluctuate 
for example  our revenues generally have been highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year  particularly in the holiday shopping season between thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  marketing initiatives undertaken by our clients or their competitors may significantly affect the number of transactions we process 
the sales process for our products and services offered to telecommunications clients is lengthy  sometimes exceeding eighteen months 
the length of the sales process makes our revenues difficult to predict 
the delay of one or more large orders could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
our consulting services revenues can fluctuate based on the timing of product sales and projects we perform for our clients 
many of our consulting engagements are of a limited duration  so it can be difficult for us to forecast consulting services revenues or staffing requirements accurately more than a few months in advance 
the factors described above under the headings if one or more of our major clients stops using our products or services or changes the combination of products and services it uses  our operating results would suffer significantly  certain of our revenues are uncertain because our clients may reduce the amounts of or change the combination of our products or services they purchase  and historically a majority of our revenues have been concentrated in the wireless telecommunications industry  which has experienced declining growth rates  consolidation and increasing pressure to control costs 
most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation and facilities  are relatively fixed 
as a result  even relatively small variations in the timing of our revenues may cause significant variations in our quarterly operating results and may result in quarterly losses 
our quarterly results may also vary due to the timing and extent of restructuring and other charges that may occur in a given quarter 
our quarterly results may be affected by new changes in accounting rules  such as the requirement to record stock based compensation expense for employee stock option grants made at fair market value 

table of contents as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations to predict our future performance 
we face significant competition for a limited supply of qualified software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel 
our business depends on the services of skilled software engineers who can develop  maintain and enhance our products  consultants who can undertake complex client projects and sales and marketing personnel 
in general  only highly qualified  highly educated personnel have the training and skills necessary to perform these tasks successfully 
in order to maintain the competitiveness of our products and services and to meet client requirements  we need to attract  motivate and retain a significant number of software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel 
qualified personnel such as these are in short supply and we face significant competition for these employees  from not only our competitors but also clients and other enterprises 
other employers may offer software engineers  consultants and sales and marketing personnel significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive career paths than we are able to offer 
any failure on our part to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel would seriously damage our business 
changes in management could affect our ability to operate our business 
our future success will depend to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers 
the loss of any of our executive officers could impair our ability to successfully manage our current business or implement our planned business objectives and our future operations may be adversely affected 
we face competition from a broad and increasing range of vendors 
the market for products and services offered to communications providers and participants in online transactions is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
each of these markets is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more products or services competitive with ours 
we anticipate continued growth and the formation of new alliances in each of the markets in which we compete  which will result in the entrance of new or the creation of bigger competitors in the future 
for example  in october  verisign  inc announced that paypal  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ebay  inc  agreed to acquire verisign s payment gateway business and to form a strategic alliance with verisign  inc for on line commerce and security 
in addition  google  inc has stated that it is developing a new payment services that may compete with us 
we face potential competition from several primary sources providers of online payment processing services  including cybersource corporation  plug pay technologies  inc  paypal  inc  google  inc 
and linkpoint international  inc software vendors that provide one or more customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention or risk management solutions  including ectel ltd  tsi telecommunications services inc  fair isaac corporation  magnum software systems  inc  cgi group  inc 
and slp infoware  service providers that offer customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention  risk management or authentication services in connection with other services  including choicepoint inc  visa usa  experian information solutions  inc  equifax  inc  lexis nexis  trans union  llc  schlumberger sema plc and amdocs ltd  information technology departments within larger carriers that have the ability to provide products and services that are competitive with those we offer  information technology vendors that offer wireless and internet software applications such as cgi group  inc  oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and international business machines corporation  consulting firms or systems integrators that may offer competitive services or the ability to develop customized solutions for customer acquisition and qualification  customer relationship management and 
table of contents retention or risk management  such as cgi group  inc  accenture ltd  bearingpoint  inc  peoplesoft  inc  siebel systems  inc 
and cap gemini ernst young  and a number of alternative technologies  including profilers  personal identification numbers and authentication  provided by companies such as verizon communications  inc  authentix network inc 
and fair isaac corporation 
because competitors can easily penetrate one or more of our markets  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies 
in addition  competition may intensify as competitors establish cooperative relationships among themselves or alliances with others 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements  or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  in order to meet client requirements  we must often work cooperatively with companies that are  in other circumstances  competitors 
the need for us to work cooperatively with such companies may limit our ability to compete aggressively with those companies in other circumstances 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents for  or otherwise protect  our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
much of our know how and other proprietary technology is not covered by patent or similar protection  and in many cases cannot be so protected 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary software and other proprietary intellectual property rights  other companies could more easily enter our markets and compete successfully against us 
we have a limited number of us and foreign patents  and have pending applications for additional patents  but we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on those applications  that any of our current or future patents will protect our business or technology against competitors that develop similar technology or products or services or provide us with a competitive advantage  or that others will not claim rights in our patents or our proprietary technologies 
patents issued and patent applications filed relating to products used in the wireless telecommunications and payment processing industry are numerous and it may be the case that current and potential competitors and other third parties have filed or will file applications for  or have received or will receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products used or proposed to be used by us 
we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any current or future products or services 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and clients and restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or detect unauthorized use of and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our foreign operations subject us to risks and concerns which could negatively affect out business overall 
we have operations outside the us at our contact center located in liverpool  nova scotia  canada and are planning to deploy other contact center operations outside the us in addition to the risks generally associated with operations in the us  operations in foreign countries present us with additional risks  including the following the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  
table of contents the need to comply with a wide variety of complex us and foreign laws including  without limitation  import and export laws and treaties  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  security risks  and difficulties in managing staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations 
our business could require additional financing 
our future business activities  including our operation of authorize 
net  the development or acquisition of new or enhanced products and services  the acquisition of additional computer and network equipment  the costs of compliance with government regulations and future expansions including acquisitions will require us to make significant capital expenditures 
if our available cash resources prove to be insufficient  because of unanticipated expenses  revenue shortfalls or otherwise  we may need to seek additional financing or curtail our expansion activities 
if we obtain equity financing for any reason  our existing stockholders may experience dilution in their investments 
if we obtain debt financing  our business could become subject to restrictions that affect our operations or increase the level of risk in our business 
it is also possible that  if we need additional financing  we will not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms  or at all

overview we develop  market and support a suite of products and services for merchants that sell products and services online and communications providers  including payment processing  customer acquisition and qualification  risk management  and authentication services 
a majority of our revenues historically have been derived from clients located in the united states 
our revenues are derived from transaction services and consulting and maintenance services 
our transaction service revenues are derived primarily from the processing of applications for qualification of subscribers for telecommunications services  the activation of services for those subscribers and from the processing of payment transactions for merchants 
our telecommunications transactions offerings include 
table of contents screening for subscriber fraud  evaluating carriers existing accounts  interfacing with carrier and third party systems and providing contact center services 
we also offer transaction services to screen and authenticate the identity of users engaged in online transactions 
our transaction based solutions provide multiple  remote  systems access for workflow management  along with centrally managed client specified business policies  and links to client and third party systems 
transaction services are provided through contracts with carriers and others  which specify the services to be utilized and the markets to be served 
our clients are charged for these services on a per transaction basis 
pricing varies depending primarily on the volume and type of transactions  the number and type of other products and services selected for integration with the services and the term of the contract under which services are provided 
the volume of transactions processed varies depending on seasonal and retail trends  the success of the carriers and others utilizing our services in attracting subscribers and the markets served by our clients 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
we believe we may continue to experience changes in the combination of services acquired by tds clients and that competitive pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect transaction revenues in in order to add to our business  we are seeking to expand our reach in the e commerce and payment processing business markets and to target industry sectors in the tds business we do not currently serve and to add new telecommunications clients 
on january   the company announced a restructuring focused primarily within the tds business  as well as reductions in general and administrative expenses 
this action reflects the company s continued commitment to align cost and revenue 
the restructuring consists of a total workforce reduction of about  and the company expects to record a restructuring charge of approximately to million in the first quarter of  primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits 
transaction services revenues related to payment processing are derived from our credit card processing and ach processing services  and other services collectively  processing services 
processing services revenue is based on a one time set up fee  a monthly gateway fee  and a fee per transaction 
the per transaction fee is recognized in the period in which the transaction occurs 
gateway fees are monthly subscription fees charged to our merchant customers for the use of our payment gateway 
gateway fees are recognized in the period in which the service is provided 
set up fees represent one time charges for initiating our processing services 
although these fees are generally paid to us at the commencement of the agreement  they are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of the merchant relationship  which is determined through a series of analyses of active and deactivated merchants 
commissions paid to outside sales partners are recorded in sales and marketing expense in our statements of operations in the month in which the related revenue is recognized 
our consulting revenues are derived principally from providing solution development and deployment services and business advisory consulting in the areas of customer acquisition and retention  authentication  and risk management 
the majority of consulting engagements are performed on a time and materials basis and revenues from these engagements are recognized based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour and are recognized in the period in which services are performed 
when we perform work under a fixed fee arrangement  revenues are generally recognized on the proportional performance method of accounting based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
in instances where the customer  at its discretion  has the right to reject the services prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
operating segments based upon the way financial information is provided to our chief operating decision maker  the chief executive officer  for use in evaluating allocation of resources and assessing performance of the business  we now report our operations in two distinct operating segments payment processing services  and telecom decisioning services 
the payment processing segment offers a transaction processing system  under the authorize 
net brand  that allows businesses to authorize  settle and manage credit card  electronic check and other electronic payment transactions online 
the tds segment provides customer qualification  risk assessment  fraud screening  consulting services and contact center services to telecommunications and other companies 
within these two segments  
table of contents performance is measured based on revenue  gross profit and operating income loss realized from each segment 
there are no transactions between segments 
we do not allocate certain corporate or centralized marketing and general and administrative expenses to our business unit segments  because these activities are managed separately from the business units 
also  we do not allocate restructuring expenses and other non recurring gains or charges to our business unit segments because our chief executive officer evaluates the segment results exclusive of these items 
asset information by operating segment is not reported to or reviewed by our chief executive officer and therefore we have not disclosed asset information for each operating segment 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues and certain revenues comparisons for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended december  december  difference difference dollars in thousands transaction services consulting and maintenance services software licensing and hardware total the decrease in transaction services revenues was due to the decline of million in transaction services revenue from our tds segment partially offset by an increase in revenue of million from authorize 
net 
the decline in tds transaction services revenues was primarily a result of a million reduction in transaction fees charged to at t wireless  a decrease in transaction fees charged to sprint and nextel as a result of the merger between sprint and nextel  and an unfavorable change in the mix of services provided to them 
tds transaction services revenues in included approximately million related to a settlement received as a result of the worldcom  inc bankruptcy proceedings  for services provided to worldcom  inc in we did not recognize revenue at the time the services were performed due to concerns regarding the collectibility of our fees 
the increase in authorize 
net transaction services revenue was due to a full year of revenue in and an increase in the number of merchant customers added and the volume of transactions processed 
lightbridge began recording payment processing revenues as of april  following the acquisition of authorize 
net on march  the year ended december  includes revenue from april  through december  authorize 
net revenue for the year ended december  increased compared to the same period in as reported by the company and authorize 
net s former owner  infospace  inc in the near term  we expect transaction services revenue from authorize 
net to continue to increase and comprise a majority of our business in however  in the near term  we also expect transaction services revenue associated with our tds segment to decline from levels as a result of declining revenues from at t wireless  pricing reductions to sprint and nextel following the merger of the two companies  and continued pricing pressures 
we do not expect at t wireless to contribute significant revenues in we expect tds transaction services revenues to continue to reflect the industry s rate of growth of new subscribers as well as the rate of switching among carriers by subscribers subscriber churn 
we believe that transaction revenue in future periods will continue to be impacted by industry trends  changes in the demand for our transaction offerings  changes in the combination of services purchased by clients  carrier consolidation  and competitive pricing pressures 
the decrease in consulting and maintenance services revenues of million was principally due to lower revenues from at t wireless and a decline in consulting and maintenance revenues related to our decision to no longer actively market  sell or develop our rms product 
we believe that consulting and maintenance services revenue related to our tds segment will continue to be impacted by pricing pressures on maintenance services and a reduced level of consulting activity 

table of contents the decline in software licensing and hardware revenues of million in was due to our decision to no longer actively market  sell or develop our rms product 
we do not expect any significant software licensing and hardware revenues in the future 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel costs  software and services  costs of maintaining systems and networks used in processing qualification and activation transactions including depreciation and amortization of systems and networks and amortization of capitalized software and acquired technology 
cost of revenues for authorize 
net  included in transaction services cost of revenues  consists of expenses associated with the delivery  maintenance and support of authorize 
net s products and services  including personnel costs  communication costs  such as high bandwidth internet access  server equipment depreciation  transactional processing fees  as well as customer care costs 
in the future  cost of revenues may vary as a percentage of total revenues as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the volume of transactions processed  changes in the mix of transaction revenues between those from automated transaction processing and those from processing transactions through our teleservices contact centers  changes in pricing to certain clients and changes in the mix of total revenues among transaction services revenues  consulting and maintenance services revenues  and software licensing and hardware revenues

we also realized reductions in third party data and services costs as a result of processing fewer transactions for at t wireless  reduced costs for maintaining systems and networks used in processing qualification and activation transactions  and personnel related savings resulting from our restructuring activities 
transaction services gross profit and gross profit percentage increased primarily as a result of authorize 
net s higher contribution to the transaction services gross profit amount 
authorize 
net s percent of the transaction services gross profit amount was in versus in as a result of higher revenues 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the transaction services gross profit related to our tds segment  where the revenue reduction exceeded the cost of sales expense reduction 
authorize 
net generated a higher gross profit percentage than our tds segment  resulting in increased transaction services gross profit percentage in in comparison with 
table of contents consulting and maintenance services cost of revenues decreased by million in this decrease was attributable to a reduction in personnel related expenses as a result of the september and december restructurings

interest income 
interest income consists of earnings on our cash and short term investment balances

in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million  which included a federal and state provision of million attributable to tax amortization of intangibles with indefinite lives and a full valuation allowance of million being recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  changes in the business in which we operate and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable 
table of contents income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
despite our profitability in  as of december   we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax assets until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if circumstances change such that the realization of the deferred tax assets is concluded to be more likely than not  the company will record future income tax benefits at the time that such determination is made 
we expect to continue to increase our valuation allowance for any increase in the deferred tax liabilities relating to certain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will also adjust our valuation allowance if we assess that there is sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates 
table of contents and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily derived from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing and amounts of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue  change in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  change in revenue mix  or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must also make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current domestic and international economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if our estimates of uncollectability prove to be inaccurate  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we were to determine that it was more likely than not that we would be unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to operations in the period that such determination was made 
restructuring estimates 
restructuring related liabilities include estimates for  among other things  anticipated disposition of lease obligations 
key variables in determining such estimates include anticipated commencement of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and tenant improvement costs and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust our estimates based on currently available information 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets 
we recorded goodwill of million in connection with the acquisition of authorize 
net  and we recorded other intangible assets of million in connection with the acquisition of authorize 
net 
we are required to test such goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or if other indicators of impairment arise 
we have adopted march st as the date of the annual impairment tests for authorize 
net 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
we will assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if other indicators of impairment arise 
new accounting pronouncement not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  
table of contents stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r will require us to measure all share based payment awards to both employees and non employees using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to sfas r  we accounted for awards to employees using the intrinsic method and only included certain fair value method pro forma expense disclosures for share based awards to employees in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which expressed views of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as providing the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the company will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no 
in connection with its adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are required to adopt the new accounting provisions of sfas r for our first quarter of fiscal we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over our awards vesting period 
sfas r requires us to record compensation expense for all awards granted after adopting the standard  as well as recording compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated net income and net income per share 
however  various uncertainties  including stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  employee stock option exercise behavior and related tax impacts  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense to be incurred in future periods will be similar to the pro forma expense disclosed in note to our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
r companies may elect to use either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective approach  the previously reported amounts are restated either to the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented to reflect the sfas amounts in the income statement 
effective january   the company adopted sfas r utilizing the modified prospective method 
the company expects the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on net income and net income per share and is currently in the process of evaluating the extent of such impact 
additionally  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement could or will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk exposure inherent in our financial instruments and consolidated financial position represents the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months and less than one year are considered to be short term investments 
cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
short term investments are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices 
the amortized cost of available for sale debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
realized gains and losses  and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale debt securities  if any  are included in interest income  net 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities are included in interest income  net 
market risk for cash and cash equivalents is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the assets or obligations resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would not have been significant to our financial position or results of operations during 
table of contents our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been limited 
all revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
we pay for certain foreign operating expenses such as foreign payroll  rent and office expense in foreign currency and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of any currency exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in the period incurred
