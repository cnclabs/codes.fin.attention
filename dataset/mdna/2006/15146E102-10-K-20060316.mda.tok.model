the bank may experience loan losses in excess of its allowance for loan losses 
the bank maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe is adequate to absorb any inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that are beyond the bank s control may cause its actual loan losses to exceed current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the allowance for loan losses  it will hurt the bank s business 
in addition  the fdic and the california department of financial institutions  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to increase its provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of the bank s management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the department of financial institutions could also hurt the bank s business 
the bank tries to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans 
losses nevertheless occur 
the bank establishes a loan loss allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statements of financial condition date 
the bank bases allowance on estimates of the following industry standards  historical loss experience  evaluation of current economic conditions  assessment of risk factors for loans with exposure to the economies of south korea and other pacific rim countries  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying the bank s loans 
the bank may have difficulty managing its growth 
the bank s total assets have increased to billion as of december   from billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the bank opened on average  two new branch offices from through the bank intends to investigate other opportunities to open additional branches that would complement the bank s existing business as such opportunities may arise  however  the bank can provide no assurance that it will be able to identify additional locations or open additional branches 
the bank s ability to manage its growth will depend primarily on its ability to monitor operations  control costs  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if the bank fails to achieve those objectives in an efficient and timely manner  the bank may experience interruptions and dislocations in its business  which could substantially increase the expenses and negatively impact the ability to retain the bank s customers 
in addition  such concerns may cause federal and state banking regulators to require us to delay or forgo any proposed growth until such problems have been addressed to the satisfaction of those regulators 

table of contents the bank has found that growth by de novo branch banking in and prior years has temporarily increased the bank s overhead expenses as a percentage of its total assets 
if the bank continues to open additional branches  it expects to face similar increased costs 
the bank s earnings are subject to interest rate risk  especially if rates fall 
banking companies earnings depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board  the international interest rate environment  as well as by economic  regulatory and competitive factors which influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of nonperforming assets 
many of these factors are beyond the bank s control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for products and services 
the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest earning assets 
given current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  interest rate spread could be expected to increase during times of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during times of falling interest rates 
therefore  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse or a positive effect on results of operations 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate risk 
all of the bank s lending involves underwriting risks  especially in a competitive lending market 
at december   commercial real estate loans represented of the bank s total loan portfolio  commercial lines and term loans to businesses represented of the bank s total loan portfolio  and sba loans represented of the bank s total loan portfolio 
real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of underlying real estate collateral and the cash flow from income producing properties 
declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors  including adversity in general economic conditions  rising interest rates  changes in tax and other governmental and other policies affecting real estate holdings  environmental conditions  governmental and other use restrictions  development of competitive properties  and increasing vacancy rates 
the bank s dependence increases the risk of loss both in the bank s loan portfolio and with respect to any other real estate owned when real estate values decline 
the bank seeks to reduce risk of loss through underwriting and monitoring procedures 
commercial lending  even when secured by the assets of a business  involves considerable risk of loss in the event of failure of the business 
to reduce such risk  the bank typically takes additional security interests in other collateral  such as real property  certificates of deposit or life insurance  and or obtains personal guarantees 
specific risks associated with sba lending are discussed in a separate risk factor below 
the bank operates in a highly competitive market  and some of its competitors offer a broader range of services than the bank provides  and have lower cost structures 
the banking business in the bank s current and intended future market areas is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services 
while the banking market in our primary market area is generally dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area  the main competitors include several locally owned and operated korean american banks and subsidiaries of one korean bank 
these other banks have branches located in many of the same neighborhoods as the bank  provide similar types of products and services and use the same korean language publications and media for their marketing purposes 
there is a high level of competition within this specific market 
while major banks have not historically focused their marketing efforts on the korean american customer base in southern california  their 
table of contents competitive influence could increase in the future 
such banks have substantially greater lending limits than the bank  offer certain services the bank cannot  and often operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs than the bank can on a per loan or per asset basis 
in addition to competitive factors impacting the bank s specific market niche  the bank is affected by more general competitive trends in the banking industry  including intra state and interstate consolidation  competition from non bank sources and technological innovations 
many of the bank s competitors have advantages conducting certain businesses and providing certain services  and there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to compete successfully 
the bank also competes with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies located within and without the bank s service area and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and the bank competes with the providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down the bank s interest margins and reduce profitability 
it also can make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of the loan portfolio and deposit base

the company might not be able to continue to pay cash dividends in the future 
as a banking holding company  which currently has no significant assets other than the company s equity interest in center bank  the company s ability to pay dividends primarily depends upon the dividends the company receives from center bank 
the dividend practice of center bank  like the company s dividend practice  will depend upon its earnings  financial position  current and anticipated cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by center bank s board of directors at that time 
in addition  during any period in which center financial has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  the company may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to our capital stock 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
the company paid quarterly cash dividends of cents per share in and and currently plans to continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  the amount of any such dividend will be determined each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion  based on the factors described in the previous paragraph 
no assurance can be given that future performance will justify the payment of dividends in any particular quarter 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
substantially all of our revenue and cash flow  including funds available for the payment of dividends and other operating expenses  is dependent upon the payment of dividends to the company by the company s subsidiaries 
dividends payable to the company by center bank are restricted under california and federal laws and regulation

the bank has specific risks associated with small business administration loans 
the bank realized million  million  and million  respectively  in and in and  in gains recognized on secondary market sales of the bank s sba loans 
the bank has regularly sold the guaranteed portions of these loans in the secondary market in previous years 
however  the company initiated the sale of the unguaranteed portion of sba loans during the third quarter of the bank can provide no assurance that it will be able to continue originating these loans  or that a secondary market will exist for  or that it will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the sba loans 
the federal government presently guarantees to of the principal amount of each qualifying sba loan 
the bank can provide no assurance that the federal government will maintain the sba program  or if it does  that such guaranteed portion will remain at its current funding level 
furthermore  the bank can provide no assurance that it will retain the preferred lender status  which  subject to certain limitations  allows us to approve and fund sba loans without the necessity of having the loan approved in advance by the sba  or that if it does  the federal government will not reduce the amount of such loans 
the bank believes that the sba loan portfolio does not involve more than a normal risk of collectibility 
however  since the bank has sold some of the guaranteed portions of the sba loan portfolio  the 
table of contents bank incurs a pro rata credit risk on the non guaranteed portion of the sba loans since the bank shares pro rata with the sba in any recoveries 
in the event of default on an sba loan  pursuit of remedies against a borrower would be subject to sba approval  and where the sba establishes that its loss is attributable to deficiencies in the manner in which the loan application has been prepared and submitted  the sba may decline to honor its guarantee with respect to the sba loans or it may seek the recovery of damages from us 
the sba has never declined to honor its guarantees with respect to its sba loans  although no assurance can be given that the sba would not attempt to do so in the future

another economic downturn in south korea could cause us to incur losses with respect to certain of loans and credit transactions  exposed to the korean economy 
because a significant portion of the bank s customer base is korean american  the bank has historically had exposure to the korean economy with respect to certain of the loans and credit transactions 
the bank has historically made four types of credit extensions involving direct exposure to the south korean economy i commercial loans to us affiliates  subsidiaries  or branches of companies located in south korea korean affiliate loans  ii unused commitments for loans to affiliates of korean companies  iii acceptances by south korean banks  and iv loans against standby letters of credit issued by south korean banks 
the bank also has indirect exposure to the economies of various pacific rim countries because the bank provides short term trade financing to local import and or export businesses in connection with issuing letters of credit to overseas suppliers sellers  as well as making working capital and other business loans to such businesses  some of which could be hurt by a downturn in the economies of such countries 
the korean economy and its capital markets suffered significant downturns in late and early  and the bank had one korean affiliate loan for million that had to be charged off in because such customer was directly impacted by the problems in south korea 
since that time the bank fully recovered all million 
this one charge off in represented in excess of of the bank s total charge offs in see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition nonperforming assets  allowance for loan losses and market risk interest rate risk management 
since that time  the bank has been closely monitoring the exposure to the korean economy and those of other pacific rim countries and has taken steps to reduce the exposure and to make sure that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses that might occur if problems were to arise again in south korea or those other countries 
however  another severe downturn in the korean economy or in the economies of other pacific rim countries could cause the bank to incur significant credit losses 
the company and bank s directors and executive officers control a large amount of the company s stock  and shareholder s interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of december   the company s directors and executive officers together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of company s outstanding voting stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they would be able to significantly affect the election of directors as well as the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  such as the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
such concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of center financial 
in some situations  the interests of the company s directors and executive officers may be different from the shareholders 
however  the company s board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in the company s articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of the company or the company s management include staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  
table of contents the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and a requirement that the company s board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on the bank s employees  depositors  customers and the communities served as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of center financial 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire the company  which could reduce the market price of the company s common stock and the price that the shareholder may ultimately receive when their stock is sold 
the company is involved in litigation 
from time to time  the company is involved in litigation 
if litigation arises against us  the company will vigorously enforce and defend its rights 
litigation may result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of the company s management personnel from their day to day responsibilities 
in addition  in the event of an adverse result in litigation  the company could also be required to pay substantial damages 
the company is currently a party to a lawsuit entitled korea export insurance corporation v 
korea data systems usa  inc  et al 
as a result  the company s defense of this lawsuit  regardless of its eventual outcome  will likely be costly and time consuming 
for a more detailed discussion of this lawsuit  see item  legal proceedings

unresolved staff comments none item properties properties the bank and company s headquarters are located at wilshire boulevard  los angeles  california the bank leases approximately  square feet  which includes a ground floor branch and administrative offices located on the seventh floor of the building 
the initial lease term will expire in the bank has options to renew the lease for two additional terms of five years each 
as of december   the bank operated full service branches at thirteen leased locations including the branch described in the previous paragraph 
expiration dates of the bank s leases range from march to september certain properties currently leased have renewal options  which could extend the use of the facility for additional specified terms 
in the opinion of management  all properties are adequately covered by insurance 
all of the bank s existing facilities are considered adequate for its present and anticipated future use 
item legal proceedings from time to time  the bank is a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
with the exception of the potentially adverse outcome in the litigation described in the next three paragraphs  after taking into consideration information furnished by counsel as to the current status of these claims and proceedings  we do not believe that the aggregate potential liability resulting from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
on or about march   the bank was served with a complaint filed by korea export insurance corporation keic in orange county  california superior court  naming the bank as one of several defendants 
keic is seeking to recover alleged losses from a number of parties involved in international trade transactions that gave rise to bills of exchange financed by various korean banks but not ultimately paid 
keic is seeking to recover damages of approximately million based on a claim that the bank  in its capacity as a presenting bank for these bills of exchange  acted negligently in presenting and otherwise handling trade documents for collection 

table of contents on november   the orange county superior court dismissed all claims of keic against the bank on the grounds that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over keic s claims against the bank 
keic has appealed the dismissal  and  in addition  has filed a new claim against the bank in federal court 
the bank intends to continue to vigorously defend both the state court appeal and this new federal claim 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation  and it will be expensive and time consuming to defend 
one of the bank s insurance companies  bancinsure  has informed the bank that there is coverage for a portion of the defense 
while it is possible that the claims may ultimately be determined to be covered by insurance  bancinsure has reserved its rights to determine whether coverage exists and ultimately may deny coverage 
if the outcome of this litigation is adverse to the bank  and the bank is required to pay significant monetary damages  our financial condition and results of operations are likely to be materially and adversely affected

dividends as a banking holding company  which currently has no significant assets other than the company s equity interest in center bank  the company s ability to pay dividends primarily depends upon the dividends received from center bank 
the dividend practice of center bank  like the company s dividend practice  will depend upon its earnings  financial position  current and anticipated cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by center bank s board of directors at that time 
in addition  during any period in which it has deferred payment of interest otherwise due and payable on its subordinated debt securities  center financial may not make any dividends or distributions with respect to its capital stock 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
beginning in october  center financial commenced a new dividend policy paying quarterly cash dividends to its shareholders 
in accordance with this policy  the company paid a cash dividend of cents per share in may  august  october and january  respectively 
the company plans to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  provided that such dividends allow the company to continue to meet regulatory capital requirements and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
prior to october  the company had been reinvesting its earnings into its capital in order to support the company s continuous growth through the payment of stock rather than cash dividends 
center bank s ability to pay cash dividends is also subject to certain legal limitations 
under california law  banks may declare a cash dividend out of their net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or the net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or with the prior 
table of contents written approval of the commissioner of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of i the retained earnings of the bank  ii the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or iii the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
in addition  under federal law  banks are prohibited from paying any dividends if after making such payment they would fail to meet any of the minimum regulatory capital requirements 
the federal regulators also have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in any business practices which are considered to be unsafe or unsound  and in some circumstances the regulators might prohibit the payment of dividends on that basis even though such payments would otherwise be permissible 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law allows us to pay dividends to the company s shareholders if the company s retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed dividend 
if the company does not have sufficient retained earnings available for the proposed dividend  the company may still pay a dividend to the company s shareholders if it meets two conditions after giving effect to the dividend 
those conditions are generally as follows i the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would equal at least times the company s liabilities  and ii the company s current assets would equal at least the company s current liabilities or  if the average of the company s earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the company s interest expense for such fiscal years  then the company s current assets must equal at least times the company s current liabilities

table of contents critical accounting policies accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the financial information contained in these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
these critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective decisions and assessments and have the greatest potential impact on the company s results of operations 
management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those relating to the following investment securities  loan sales  allowance for loan losses  interest rate swaps and share based compensation 
the following is a summary of these accounting policies 
in each area  the company has identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
the company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from the company s estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on the bank s ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated comprehensive other income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of the bank s investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
the bank is obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to the bank s investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
aside from the fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stocks that were determined to be impaired and written down as of december   the bank did not have any other investment securities that were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
loan sales certain small business administration sba loans that the bank has the intent to sell prior to maturity are designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
a portion of the premium on sale of sba loans is recognized as other operating income at the time of the sale 
the remaining portion of the premium relating to the portion of the loan retained is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield 
servicing assets are recognized when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing costs  over the estimated life of the loan  using a discount rate based on the related note rate plus to 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated future servicing income 
management periodically evaluates the servicing asset for impairment  which is the carrying amount of the servicing asset in excess of the related fair value 
impairment  if it occurs  is recognized in a write down in the period of impairment 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the bank s allowance for loan loss methodologies incorporate a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the bank s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the bank s markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in its methodologies 
as the bank adds new products  increases the complexity of the loan portfolio  and expands the geographic coverage  the bank will enhance the methodologies to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
changes in any of the above factors could have significant impact to the loan loss calculation 
the bank believes that its methodologies continue to be appropriate given its size and level of complexity 
detailed information concerning the bank s loan loss methodology is contained in item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
interest rate swaps as a part of its asset and liability management strategy the bank has included derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
the company s interest rate swaps were intended to constitute cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  when effectiveness testing at the beginning of each quarter shows that they are effective 
in accordance with sfas no 
 such interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the company is not currently intending to hedge in accordance to sfas no 
when such swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the change in the fair value of the swaps is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
however  if the swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  then the change in the fair value of the swaps is recorded as a gain or loss directly to the consolidated statements of operations as a part of non interest expense 
the company does not use hedge accounting treatment to account for its interest rate swaps 
therefore  the difference between the market and book value of these instruments is included in current earnings 
during  a mark to market loss of  was recognized  compared to a mark to market loss of  and a gain of  for and  respectively 
the company  in compliance with sfas  includes the swap settlement payments in interest income when hedge accounting treatment is used and in non interest expense when hedge accounting treatment is not used 
share based compensation the company has adopted sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans 
the standards include the recognition of compensation expense over the vesting period of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant 
sfas no 
permits entities to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide only the pro forma net income and pro forma net earnings per share disclosures as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense for fixed options would be recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
in accounting for its stock option plan and provide the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 as amended  in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements

the company declared its quarterly cash dividend of per share in march  june  september and december or for the year ended december  all liquidity measures at december  met or exceeded the same measures at december  
table of contents results of operations net interest income the company s earnings depend largely upon its net interest income  which is the difference between the income received from its loan portfolio and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on its deposits and other liabilities

commercial real estate loans 
real estate lending involves risks associated with the potential decline in the value of the underlying real estate collateral and the cash flow from the income producing properties 
declines in real estate values and cash flows can be caused by a number of factors  including adversity in general economic conditions  rising interest rates  changes in tax and other governmental and other policies affecting real estate holdings  environmental conditions  governmental and other use restrictions  development of competitive properties  and increasing vacancy rates 
the company s dependence on real estate values increases the risk of loss both in the company s loan portfolio and with respect to any other real estate owned when real estate values decline 
the company offers commercial real estate loans secured by industrial buildings  retail stores  or office buildings  where the property s repayment source generally comes from tenants or businesses that fully or partially occupy the building

table of contents for investor owned property

the majority of the commercial real estate loans currently being originated contain interest rates tied to the company s prime rate that adjusts with changes in the national prime rate 
the company also extends commercial real estate loans with fixed rates 
payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
repayment of such loans may therefore be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways  including limiting the size of such loans and strictly scrutinizing the properties securing the loans 
the company generally obtains loan guarantees from financially capable parties 
the company s lending personnel inspect substantially all of the properties collateralizing the company s real estate loans before such loans are made 
as of december   commercial real estate loans totaled million  representing of total loans  compared to million or of total loans at december  the increase in the percentage of commercial real estate loans resulted from management s efforts to promote this segment of the portfolio  as such loans involve a somewhat lesser degree of risk than certain other loans in the portfolio due to the nature and value of the collateral

the company does not participate in joint ventures or make equity investments in connection with its construction lending 
construction loans involve additional risks compared to loans secured by existing improved real property 
these risks include the following i the uncertain value of the project prior to completion  ii the inherent uncertainty in estimating construction costs  which is often beyond the control of the borrower  iii construction delays and cost overruns  and iv the difficulty in accurately evaluating the market value of the completed project 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than on the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of and its accrued interest on the construction loan

an appraisal is obtained from a qualified real estate appraisal for substantially all loans secured by real estate 
most of the company s consumer loans are repayable on an installment basis 
consumer loans are generally unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance  because the collateral is more likely to suffer damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  the collection of loans to individuals is dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  often limit the amount  which a lender can recover on consumer loans 
consumer loans may also give rise to claims and defense by consumer loan borrowers against the lender on these loans  such as the company  and a borrower may be able to assert against such assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller or the underlying collateral

the primary manner in which adverse changes in the economic conditions in the relevant pacific rim countries would affect business customers in the export business is a decrease in the volume in their respective businesses 
as a result  the company s volume of such loans would tend to decrease due to lower demand 
in addition  export loans are generally dependent on the customer s cash flow and thus may be subject to adverse conditions in the general economy of the country or countries with which the customer does its exporting business 
the company s import loans are generally to us domestic business entities whose operations would not be directly affected by the economic conditions of foreign countries  as importers can typically obtain goods from an alternative market if necessary  so the effect on the borrower s business would be less significant 
the company limits its risk exposure with respect to export loans by participating in the state and federal agency supported export programs such as the export working capital program and the california export finance office  which guarantee to of the export loans 
the company also requires that a majority of export finance loans be supported by letters of credit issued by established creditworthy commercial banks 
the company also monitors other foreign countries for economic or political risks to the portfolio 
as part of its allowance for loan losses methodology  the company assigns one of three rating factors to borrowers in these businesses  depending upon the perceived degree of indirect country risk and allocates an additional amount to the allowance to reflect the potential additional risk from such indirect exposure to the economies of those foreign countries

loan maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates the following table shows the maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the company s outstanding loans as of december  in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans with floating interest rates and those with fixed interest rates 
the table includes nonaccrual loans of million 
loan maturities schedule as of december  within one year after one but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands real estate construction commercial commercial consumer trade finance sba other total loans with predetermined fixed interest rates loans with variable floating interest rates includes advances on trust receipts  clean advances  cash advances  acceptances discounted  and documentary negotiable advances under commitments 
consists of transactions in process and overdrafts 

table of contents nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of loans on nonaccrual status  loans days or more past due but not on nonaccrual status  loans restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  and oreo other real estate owned 
management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless they are both fully secured and in process of collection 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
management s classification of a loan as nonaccrual or restructured is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full collectibility of principal or interest on the loan 
at this point  the company stops recognizing income from the interest on the loan and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid 
the remaining balance of the loan will be charged off if the loan deteriorates further due to a borrower s bankruptcy or similar financial problems  unsuccessful collection efforts or a loss classification by regulators and or auditors 
these loans may or may not be collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
there were no oreo outstanding at december  if the company acquires oreo  it records the property at the lower of its carrying value or its fair value less anticipated disposal costs 
any write down of oreo is charged to earnings 
the company may make loans to potential buyers of oreo to facilitate the sale of oreo 
in those cases  all loans made to such buyers must be reviewed under the same guidelines as those used for making customary loans  and must conform to the terms and conditions consistent with the company s loan policy 
any deviations from this policy must be specifically noted and reported to the appropriate lending authority 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no

the company evaluates impairment of loans according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including contractual interest payments and contractual principal payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 

table of contents the following table provides information on impaired loans for the periods indicated impaired loans as of december  dollars in thousands impaired loans with specific reserves impaired loans without specific reserves total impaired loans allowance on impaired loans net recorded investment in impaired loans average total recorded investment in impaired loans interest income recognized on impaired loans on a cash basis allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment of the level of allowance adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of financial condition date 
on a monthly basis  the company assesses the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  utilizing a disciplined and systematic approach which includes the application of a specific allowance for identified problem loans  a formula allowance for identified graded loans  an allocated allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  and an allocated allowance for country risk exposure 
allowance for specifically identified problem loans 
a specific allowance is established for impaired loans in accordance with sfas a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the specific allowance is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  the company may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  the company measures impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when it is determined that foreclosure is probable 
formula allowance for identified graded loans 
non homogenous loans such as commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance and sba loans that are not subject to the allowance for specifically identified loans discussed above are reviewed individually and subject to a formula allowance 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding pass  special mention  substandard and doubtful loans 
the evaluation of inherent loss for these loans involves a high degree of uncertainty  subjectivity and judgment because probable loan losses are not identified with a specific loan 
in determining the formula allowance  the bank relies on a mathematical calculation that incorporates a twelve quarter rolling average of historical losses 
in order to reflect the impact of recent events  the twelve quarter rolling average has been weighted 
loans risk rated pass  special mention and substandard for the most recent three quarters are adjusted to an annual basis as follows the most recent quarter is weighted  the second most recent is weighted  and the third most recent is weighted the formula allowance may be further adjusted to account for the following qualitative factors changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  
table of contents changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans 
the portion of the allowance allocated to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans is focused on loss experience for the pool rather than on an analysis of individual loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans consist of consumer loans to individuals 
the allowance for groups of performing loans is based on historical losses over a three year period 
in determining the level of allowance for delinquent groups of loans  the bank classifies groups of homogenous loans based on the number of day s delinquent 
allowance for country risk exposure 
the allowance for country risk exposure is based on an estimate of probable losses relating to both direct and indirect exposure to the economies of various pacific rim countries 
the exposure is related to trade finance loans made to support export import business between the us and korea  korean affiliate loans  and certain loans to local us business that are supported by stand by letters of credit issued by korean banks 
as with the credit rating system  the bank uses a country risk grading system under which risk gradings have been divided into three ranks 
to determine the risk grading  the company evaluates loans to companies with a significant portion of their business reliant upon imports or exports to pacific rim countries 
the company then analyzes the degree of dependency on business  suppliers or other business areas dependent upon such countries and applies an individual rating to the credit 
the company provides an allowance for country risk exposure based upon the rating of dependency 
most of the company s business customers whose operations are indirectly affected by the economies of such countries are in the import or export business 
as part of its methodology  the company assigns one of three rating factors  or basis points to borrowers in these businesses  depending upon the perceived degree of indirect exposure to such economies 
the country risk exposure factor reflected in the table below is in addition to the allowance for such loans  which is already reflected  in the formula allowance 
this factor takes into account both the direct risk on the loans included in the loans involving country risk table above  and the loans to import or export businesses involving indirect exposure to the economies of pacific rim countries 
the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves judgmental discretion  and eventual losses may therefore differ from even the most recent estimates 
further  the company s independent loan review consultants  as well as the company s external auditors  the fdic and the california department of financial institutions review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
the company continued to record loss provisions to compensate for both the continued growth in the company s loan portfolio and the continued change in the composition of the overall loan portfolio  reflecting a steady shift toward commercial real estate and commercial loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was of total loans as of december  compared to as of december  the company provides an allowance for the new credits based on the migration analysis 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december  as compared to  and in 
table of contents  and  respectively 
management believes the risks in the portfolio are sufficiently lower to justify reducing the ratio of the allowance to total loans  since the company s mix of loans shifted towards real estate loans secured by first deeds of trust  the ratio of the allowance to nonaccrual loans increased slightly 
management believes that the level of allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover the known and probable risks of the nonperforming loans as of december  the following table sets forth the composition of the allowance for loan losses as of dates indicated composition of allowance for loan losses as of december  dollars in thousands specific impaired loans formula non homogeneous homogeneous country risk exposure total allowance and reserve starting in the company allocated the specific reserve on all impaired loans  whereas previously the company provided specific reserves only for loans with balances of  or more and allocated formula allowances for the loans with balances of less than  the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  this increases were mainly due to a million increase in the formula non homogeneous allowance 
formula allowances were increased due to loan growth 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the country risk allowance and specific allowance related to impaired loans 
management is committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered commensurate with estimated and known risks in the portfolio 
although the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed monthly  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the portfolio 
as of december   management believes the allowance to be adequate based on its assessment of the estimated and known risks in the portfolio migration analysis of charge off history  which indicated stabilized loss ratios 
there has been no need to adjust the risk ratios applied to graded loans 
classified loans stood at million as of december  compared to million as of december  this increase in was primarily due the growth of the loan portfolio 
based on the calculation and continued loan recoveries  management believes that the level of allowance as of december  is adequate to absorb the estimated losses from any known or inherent risks in the loan portfolio and the loan growth for the year 
however  no assurance can be given that economic conditions  which adversely affect the bank s service areas or other circumstances  will not be reflected in increased provisions or loan losses in the future 
the provisions for loan losses in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in provision for and was due to the considerable expansion in company s loan portfolio

the reserve for losses on commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is primarily related to lines of credit 
the company evaluates credit risk associated with the loan portfolio at the same time it evaluates credit risk associated with commitments to extend credit and letters of credits 
however  a  and  reserve for loss was necessary for the commitments is reported separately in other liabilities in the accompanying statements of financial condition at december  and  and not as part of the allowance for loan losses as presented above 

table of contents allocation of allowance for loan losses the largest increase in the allocated allowance was for commercial real estate loans  an increase of million or to million during compared to million in the increase in the allocated allowance for was primarily due to the increase in loan volume 
because commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate and historically have a low charge off ratio  commercial real estate loans required a somewhat lower reserve requirement than other loans 
the company allocated of the total allowance for commercial real estate loans  while the proportion of such loans to the total loan portfolio was 
the allocated allowance for other commercial business loans increased by  or to million at december   compared to million as of the december   reflecting growth in this portfolio 
at december   the company allocated of the total allowance to other commercial loans  due to the fact that the ratio of other commercial loans to total loans was  because the company and this part of the portfolio has historically experienced the highest percentage losses from this type of loan 
the allocated allowance for other trade finance loans increased  or to  during  compared to  korean affiliated loans and other commercial loans as of december   as a result of an increase in the volume of bankers acceptances with investment grade korean banks and the korean government backed national federation of fisheries 
bankers acceptances rely upon repayment at maturity by the accepting bank 
credit exposure related to bankers acceptances is limited by the underlying strength of the accepting bank 
however  the company increased the allocated allowance for trade finance loans due the to higher historical charge off ratio 
the company has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of its allocation of allowance for loan losses in the periods discussed above 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques in the periods discussed above that affected the determination of the current year allowance

the company maintained balances at correspondent banks to cover daily in clearings and other activities 
the average reserve balance requirements were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  most of which were covered by cash on hand and vault cash held  so no additional balances were maintained with federal reserve bank for this purpose 
a significant component of non earning assets is premises and equipment  which is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related leases  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation expense was million in as compared to million in the net book value of the company s premises and equipment totaled million at december   an increase of million compared to million at december  other assets increased by  to million as of december  compared to million at december  the increase principally reflects the fair value of the interest rate swaps in the amounts of deposits the composition and cost of the bank s deposit base are important components in analyzing the bank s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost core deposits  namely noninterest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words their propensity to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are large certificates of deposits  which generally mean time deposits with balances exceeding  because these deposits particularly when considered together with a customer s other specific deposits may exceed fdic insurance limits  depositors may select shorter maturities to offset perceived risk elements associated with deposits over  the bank offers a wide variety of retail deposit account products to both consumer and commercial deposit customers

table of contents impact of inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company is its effect on interest rates 
the bank s primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
the bank attempts to limit the impact of inflation on the bank s net interest margin through the management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as non interest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this annual report 
market risk and asset liability management market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company actively monitors its assets and liabilities to mitigate risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  the management s strategy is to match asset and liability balances within maturity categories to limit the company s exposure to earnings fluctuations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
the company s strategy for asset and liability management is formulated and monitored by the company s asset liability board committee the board committee 
this board committee is composed of four non employee directors and the president 
the board committee meets quarterly to review and adopt recommendations of the asset liability management committee 
the asset liability management committee consists of executive and manager level officers from various areas of the company including lending  investment  and deposit gathering  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management committee is to manage the financial components of the company to optimize the net income under varying interest rate environments 
the focus of this process is the development  analysis  implementation  and monitoring of earnings enhancement strategies  which provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
the asset liability management committee meets regularly to review  among other matters  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability management committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to overall asset and liability composition  and reports regularly to the board committee and the board of directors 
interest rate risk interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
in general  the interest that the company earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities is established contractually for specified period of time 
market interest rates change over time and if a financial institution cannot quickly adapt to changes in interest rates  it may be exposed to volatility in earnings 
for instance  if the company was to fund long term fixed rate assets with short term variable rate deposits  and interest rates were to rise over the term of the assets  the short term variable deposits would rise in cost  adversely affecting net interest income 
similar risks exist when rate sensitive assets for example  prime rate based loans are funded by longer term fixed rate liabilities in a falling interest rate environment 
in order to monitor and manage interest rate risk  management utilizes quarterly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling as a tool to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value sensitivity 
table of contents of the statements of financial condition 
these techniques are complementary and both are used to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
the company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of specifically identified variable rate loans see derivatives 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice during a particular time interval 
a liability sensitive position results when more liabilities than assets reprice or mature within a given period 
conversely  an asset sensitive position results when more assets than liabilities reprice within a given period 
as of december   the company was asset sensitive with a positive one year gap of million or of total assets and of earning assets 
as the company s assets tend to reprice more frequently than its liabilities over a one year horizon  the company will generally realize higher net interest income in a rising rate environment and lower net interest income in a falling rate environment 

table of contents the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns

table of contents measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also uses simulation modeling on a quarterly basis as a tool to measure the sensitivity of net interest income nii and economic value of equity eve to interest rate changes 
eve is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  such as the interest rate swaps  and other significant variables considered to be affected by interest rates 
these other significant variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities  cash flows on loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on investment securities purchased  statements of financial condition growth assumptions  and changes in interest rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and eve under immediate rising or falling market rate scenarios in basis point increments up to basis points 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the estimated impact of changes on the company s net interest income over a twelve month period and eve  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions 
change in basis points net interest income next twelve months change net portfolio value eve change dollars in thousands level as previously indicated  net income increases decreases as market interest rates rise fall  since the company is asset sensitive 
the eve decreases increases  as the rate rises falls  since the eve has a negative convexity reverse relationship with the discount rate 
as above table indicates  basis points drop in rates impacts net interest income by million or decrease  whereas rate increase of basis points impacts net interest income by only million or increase 
since average cost on interest bearing liabilities was at december   the effect of basis points drop in rates on interest bearing liabilities is protected even without a floor  but there may be almost full basis points drop in the yield of interest earning assets 
all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the rate sensitivity analysis at december  at december   the company s estimated changes in net interest income and eve was within the ranges established by the board of directors 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many community banks  which is based upon the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to forecast changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  other factors are incorporated into the model  including prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model  and other available public information 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels of the company product lines 
management believes that the assumptions it uses to evaluate the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and eve could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience were to differ from the historical experience on which they are based 

table of contents derivatives the company s historical strategies in protecting both net interest income and the economic value of equity from significant movements in interest rates have involved using various methods of assessing existing and future interest rate risk exposure and diversifying and restructuring its investment portfolio accordingly 
the company may use off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps  as part of its overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s net income  shareholders equity and cash flows 
one interest rate swap was terminated partially in the notional amount of million  from the original contract entered in october with a notional value of million  and replaced during august at the same notional amount  but with a year extended maturity to august and with a fixed rate of 
the remaining notional amount of the million swap from the original million matured on october to replace a maturing interest rate swap with a notional value of million on october   the company entered into a new interest rate swap receiving a fixed rate stream of and paying prime with a year term 
the following table provides information as of december   on the bank s outstanding derivatives description notional value period fixed receiving rate floating paying rate dollars in thousands interest rate swap ii  wsj prime at december   the wall street journal published prime rate was percent 
net interest settlements of  and million were recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively  in noninterest expense 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was  as compared to  at december  the company s policies also permit the purchase of rate caps and floors  although the company has not yet engaged in these activities 
the company does not apply hedge accounting treatment for its interest rate swaps 
market value adjustments of the swaps are included in other assets and recorded through current earnings 
the total market value adjustment was a loss of  compared to a loss of  at december  and  respectively 
liquidity liquidity is the company s ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet deposit withdrawals and loan demands and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
the company s principal sources of liquidity have been growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity of securities  and repayments from loans 
to supplement its primary sources of liquidity  the company maintains contingent funding sources  which include a borrowing capacity of up to of total assets upon providing collateral with the federal home loan bank of san francisco  access to the discount window of the federal reserve bank of san francisco  a deposit facility with the california state treasurers office up to of total equity with collateral pledging  and unsecured fed funds lines with correspondent banks 
as of december   the company s liquidity ratio  which is the ratio of available liquid funds to net deposits and short term liabilities was 
total available liquidity as of that date was million  consisting of excessive cash holdings or balances in due from banks  overnight fed funds sold  money market funds and unpledged available for sale securities 
it is the company s policy to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of at least 
the company s net non core fund dependence ratio was under applicable regulatory guidelines  which assumes all certificates of deposit over  jumbo cd s as volatile sources of funds 
the company has identified approximately million of jumbo cd s as stable and core sources of funds based on past historical analysis 
the net non core fund dependence ratio was with the assumption of million as stable and core fund sources and certain portion of mmda as volatile 
the net non core fund dependence ratio is the ratio of net short term investment less non core liabilities divided by the long term assets 

table of contents capital resources shareholders equity as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the primary sources of increases in capital have been retained earnings and proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of employee and or director stock options 
the company did  however  issue million in trust preferred securities in through its wholly owned subsidiary  center capital trust i 
on march   the frb adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier i capital of bank holding companies 
however  under the final rule  after a five year transition period  the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to percent of tier i capital elements  net of goodwill 
trust preferred securities currently make up of the company s tier i capital 
shareholders equity is also affected by increases and decreases in unrealized losses on securities classified as available for sale and changes in fair value of interest rate swaps for hedging of certain prime rate based loans 
the company is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure shareholders  customers  and regulators that the company is financially sound and able to support its growth from its retained earnings 
until october  the company had been reinvesting all of its earnings into its capital in order to support the company s continuous growth  and paid only stock rather than cash dividends 
beginning in october center financial commenced a new dividend policy of paying quarterly cash dividends to its shareholders 
in accordance with this policy  the company continued to pay quarterly cash dividend of cents per share during  for a total of million 
the company plans to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  provided that such dividends allow the company to continue to meet regulatory capital requirements and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company is subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
the risk based capital guidelines assign risk weightings to assets both on and off balance sheet and place increased emphasis on common equity 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i risk based capital ratio  total risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio meet or exceed   and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
as of december   all of the company s capital ratios were above the minimum regulatory requirements for a well capitalized institution
