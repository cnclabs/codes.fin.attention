item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines to improve the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease 
we have two approved products  byetta exenatide injection  and symlin pramlintide acetate injection  both of which were commercially launched in the united states during the second quarter of byetta is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called incretin mimetics 
we began selling byetta in the united states in june it is approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type diabetes who are taking metformin and or sulfonylurea  two common oral therapies  but have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
we have an agreement with eli lilly and company  or lilly  for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide lar 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us and operating profits from products sold outside of the united states will be split to lilly and to us 
lilly has primary responsibility for developing and commercializing byetta outside of the united states  including any sustained release formulations of exenatide 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
we began selling symlin in the united states in april it is approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with either type or type diabetes who are treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
we have a field force in excess of people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
lilly also co promotes byetta in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty and primary care sales forces  a managed care and government affairs organization  a medical science organization  and diabetes care specialists 
in addition to our marketed products  our development pipeline includes late stage programs for diabetes and obesity  and a phase program in cardiovascular disease 
we are working with alkermes and lilly to develop a sustained release formulation of exenatide  which we refer to as exenatide lar  to enable once weekly administration of exenatide for the treatment of type diabetes 
we also have multiple early stage programs for diabetes and obesity  maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide therapeutics  and are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products 
all of our revenues prior to may were derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements and co promotion agreements with each of lilly and reliant pharmaceuticals  inc during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
we have been unprofitable since inception and may incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in february and september we completed public offerings of our common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not expect to generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years and accordingly  we may need to raise additional funds from outside sources 
refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones earned and for reimbursement of development costs based on contractual arrangements 
we sell our products to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the level of inventories they hold  and thus the amount of product they purchase  can materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred and title has transferred to our wholesale customers 
we recognize revenue net of allowances for discounts  distributor fees and product returns at the time of sale 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we do not offer our customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
as byetta and symlin are new products  we estimate product returns based on the experience of our collaborative partner and industry trends for other products with similar characteristics 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
allowances for product discounts arise from chargebacks and rebates  which currently include mandated discounts to government entities  contracted discounts with commercial payors  and discounts for prescription coupons 
chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
the contracted customer generally purchases the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to the company the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
rebates are amounts owed based on contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
the allowance for rebates is based on expected patient usage and contractual terms 
prescription coupon discounts are amounts owed to pharmacies for redemption of coupons for a free prescription 
we provide prescription coupons to physicians  who in turn distribute these coupons to patients 
patients may redeem the coupon at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine 
the allowance for prescription coupon discounts is based upon the number of unredeemed coupons in circulation and the expected redemption rate 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials and develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have fully reserved for these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas r share based payment  which requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements 
the cost of these awards are measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock options and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock awards  the grant date fair value of the stock options would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the option  the expected term of the option  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
sfas r may be adopted using one of the following two methods a modified prospective method in which cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of sfas r and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees before the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas r for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for us beginning january  we intend to adopt the requirements of sfas r using the modified prospective method discussed above 
the adoption of this standard is expected to increase operating expenses 
we expect that stock compensation expense for will be between and million with the significant majority included in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the actual amount of stock option expense we record for will depend on the timing and number of options granted in and underlying marketing conditions at the time of such grants 
research and development programs currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes  obesity and cardiovascular disease in various stages of development 
from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily byetta and exenatide lar and in we initiated our program for the treatment of obesity with pramlintide 
as we continue to expand our pipeline  our investment in other programs will continue to increase 
the drug development process in the us  from discovery through regulatory approval  takes an average of years according to recent industry reports 
the process includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation in humans of a potential drug candidate 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  as these trials are typically the longest and largest trials conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of our facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our overall pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table provides historical information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects in millions year ended december  byetta symlin phase programs early stage programs and research unallocated byetta we began selling byetta in the united states in june in november  we announced the positive results from a study of byetta used in addition to a common class of oral diabetes medication called thiazolidinediones or tzds  in people with type diabetes who were not achieving adequate blood sugar control 
results from this study formed the basis of our supplemental new drug application  or snda  submission to the fda in the first quarter of this snda seeks to expand our label to include patients who are taking tzds and have inadequate glycemic control 
additional development activities planned for byetta in include the initiation of a clinical study evaluating byetta for use as a monotherapy for patients with type diabetes 
the timing of material net cash inflows from our byetta development program is dependent upon market acceptance following its commercial launch in the second quarter of and the other factors described in this report 
symlin we began selling symlin in the united states in april in  we commenced a controlled  open label study to evaluate symlin use in clinical practice  and intend to enroll approximately  patients over the two years of the study 
in the fourth quarter of  we also commenced a study to evaluate the addition of symlin at mealtime for patients who are on a stable regimen of once daily basal insulin 
our planned development activities for symlin include the continuation of these studies  the initiation of a small pharmacokinetic study in pediatric age patients with type diabetes age to and the continued development of a disposable pen for the delivery of symlin in cartridges 
the timing of material net cash inflows from symlin is dependent upon market acceptance following its commercial launch in the second quarter of and the other factors described in this report 
development programs we currently have late stage development programs in diabetes and obesity and a phase program in cardiovascular disease 
in diabetes  we are studying exenatide lar  a sustained release formulation of byetta 
we recently completed a phase multi dose study of exenatide lar  utilizing a once a week dosing regimen 
results from this study demonstrated that both doses of exenatide lar were well tolerated  expected therapeutic blood levels of exenatide were achieved  and dose dependent improvements in ac and weight were observed 
we are developing exenatide lar in collaboration with lilly and alkermes 
pursuant to our amended development and license agreement with alkermes for exenatide lar  alkermes is responsible for manufacturing exenatide lar for use in clinical trials and we are responsible for commercial scale manufacture of exenatide lar 
we are working with alkermes and parsons corporation to establish a manufacturing facility for commercial production of exenatide lar  which we expect to complete in stages through additional development activities planned for exenatide lar in include the initiation of a long term  open label  randomized study to evaluate its safety and efficacy 
in obesity  we are studying pramlintide acetate  the active ingredient contained in symlin 
we submitted an ind to the fda for pramlintide acetate for the treatment of obesity in the second quarter of  and we commenced a patient phase dose ranging study of pramlintide acetate for obesity in the second quarter of in february  we reported positive results from this study 
in cardiovascular disease  we have a phase program for ac glp for the treatment of congestive heart failure 
we submitted an ind for ac in the second half of and initiated a phase study in the fourth quarter of we expect to complete this study in early stage programs and research in addition to our late stage development programs in diabetes and obesity and our phase program in cardiovascular disease  we have a research and phase program studying ac pyy for potential utility as a treatment for obesity 
we also have early stage programs in diabetes and obesity 
in early  we acquired the exclusive rights to the leptin molecular franchise and program from amgen  inc we plan to further explore leptin s utility in treating metabolic disorders 
we also maintain a discovery research program focused on novel peptide therapeutics and we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
results of operations net product sales net product sales were million in and consisted of shipments of byetta and symlin to wholesale customers  less distribution service fees and allowances for product discounts and returns 
there were no net product sales in or as these products were not approved for sale until net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments cost sharing and co promotion payments substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with lilly  and consists of the amortization of up front payments  milestone payments  cost sharing payments and co promotion payments 
the amortization of up front payments relates to an million non refundable payment made by lilly in september  upon the signing of our collaboration agreement 
in connection with this agreement we agreed to incur the first million of development costs following the date of the agreement 
accordingly  we recorded of the first million of us development costs for exenatide  whether incurred by us or by lilly  and we recorded as revenue approximately of these development costs through an amortization of million of the up front payment  which amortization was completed during the third quarter of the remaining million is being amortized to revenues ratably over a seven year period  which represents our estimate of the period of our performance of significant development activities under the agreement 
milestone payments relate to certain development and commercialization events defined in the exenatide collaboration agreement 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments and  for certain development milestones  the expiration of stock conversion rights associated with such payments 
cost sharing payments consist of amounts payable by lilly to us to equalize development expenses under our collaboration agreement 
subsequent to the first million of development expenses following the signing of our collaboration agreement  lilly became responsible to fund  on an ongoing basis  of development costs in the united states and of development costs outside of the united states 
while we continue to lead exenatide development efforts in the united states  lilly also incurs exenatide development expenses and makes cost sharing payments to us to equalize development costs  which are recorded as revenues under collaborative agreements in the period in which the related development expenses are incurred 
co promotion payments consist of small amounts of revenue earned pursuant to previous co promotion agreements 
the million increase in revenue under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects an increase in milestone revenue due to the recognition of million of milestones earned in connection with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of byetta in the united states  of which million was received in  partially offset by a reduction in cost sharing revenue due to lower development expenses for byetta in as compared to the million reduction in revenue under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  reflects a shift in the relative proportion of total development expenses related to exenatide recorded by us and by lilly and a reduction in milestone revenue 
milestone revenue in consists of a million payment from lilly in connection with the results of a clinical study comparing exenatide to insulin glargine in the third quarter of milestone revenue in consisted of a million payment from lilly following the completion of the pivotal phase trials for exenatide in the fourth quarter of in future periods  revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize us development costs  possible future milestone payments and the continued amortization of the million portion of the up front payment 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million in and is comprised primarily of costs associated with the manufacture of byetta and symlin 
there was no cost of goods sold for the years ended december  and  as we did not begin selling byetta and symlin until the second quarter of prior to regulatory approval of byetta and symlin  certain indirect costs associated with the qualification of our inventory for commercial sale were expensed and recorded as research and development expenses 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began including these costs in inventories and cost of goods sold 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared to reflects increases of million for our early stage programs and research  million for our phase programs  and million for our symlin development expenses  partially offset by reductions of million and million for our byetta and unallocated research and development expenses  respectively 
the increase in our early stage programs and research reflects increased investments in our discovery research activities  increased costs associated with preclinical development of potential drug candidates and costs associated with an increased number of employees to support these activities 
the increase in expenses for our phase programs in as compared to primarily reflects costs associated with the clinical development of exenatide lar and our obesity program for pramlintide 
for exenatide lar  this includes the recently completed multi dose study and for our obesity program with pramlintide  this includes the recently completed dose ranging study 
the increase also reflects increased costs associated with manufacturing scale up for exenatide lar 
the increase in symlin development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects increased clinical development costs associated with an ongoing open label study evaluating symlin use in clinical practice 
the decrease in byetta development expenses primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs following the completion of activities required to support regulatory approval of byetta in  which included open label extensions of the pivotal phase clinical studies for byetta and costs associated with manufacturing scale up 
the decrease in unallocated research and development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects an increased emphasis on development activities in our late stage  phase and early stage programs 
the million decrease in compared to reflects reduced expenses of million and million for our byetta and symlin development programs  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of million for our phase programs and a million increase in unallocated research and development expenses 
the decrease in expenses in as compared to primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs following the completion of the pivotal phase trials for byetta in the fall of the decrease in symlin expenses in as compared to primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs in clinical trials supporting a symlin nda submitted to the fda in june the increase in expenses for our phase programs in as compared to primarily reflects increased clinical development costs for our obesity program with pramlintide and to a lesser extent increased development expenses for exenatide lar 
the million increase in unallocated research and development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects increased facilities costs  a portion of which are allocated to research and development expense 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this expected increase reflects continued development of our late stage programs for exenatide lar and the treatment of obesity with pramlintide  clinical work to further our understand the utility of byetta and symlin and the advancement of our early stage programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared to reflects the expansion of our commercial capabilities and additions to our business infrastructure to support the commercial launches of byetta and symlin in this includes the hiring and training of our field force  expanded marketing and medical education activities  the establishment of customer service capabilities and related administrative support 
we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses include our share of these costs in the united states 
the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects increased business support and facilities costs  and to a lesser extent increased pre launch costs  primarily for byetta  incurred in preparation of the commercial launches of byetta and symlin 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase for the year ended december   compared to the same period in this expected increase primarily reflects the full annual cost and potential expansion of our field force  the majority of which was added in the middle of following the regulatory approvals of byetta and symlin 
collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million for the year ended december   and consists of amounts due to lilly for its share of the gross margin for byetta in the united states 
there was no collaborative profit sharing for the years ended december  and  as we began selling byetta in the second quarter of other income and expense interest and other income consists primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in  and million in the increase in primarily reflects higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates in as compared to the decrease in reflects the fact that in interest and other income included a one time million gain on early retirement of debt at a discount 
interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations and include interest payments and the amortization of debt interest costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to reflects a full year of interest expense for the million of convertible senior notes issued in april the increase in reflects additional interest expense associated with the issuance million of convertible senior notes in april net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increased costs and expenses  partially offset by the increases in net product sales and revenue under collaborative agreements discussed above 
the increase in the net loss in compared to primarily reflects the decrease in revenue under collaborative agreements  partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the amount of product sales that we achieve for byetta and symlin 
we also expect increased expenses associated with the commercialization of byetta and symlin  as well as increased expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  including our ongoing late stage programs and our earlier stage development programs  expenses associated with the design and construction of our manufacturing facility  and related general and administrative support that may impact our ability to reach profitability in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of common stock and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly and reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  and more recently  from sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in primarily reflects approximately million provided by our financing activities  partially offset by million used to fund operating activities and million used for capital expenditures in we used cash of million  million  and million for our operating activities in the years ended december    and  respectively 
our operating activities in benefited from a million milestone payment from lilly 
in addition  operating activities in benefited from a net source of cash of million from changes in our working capital  consisting of an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  partially offset by uses of cash due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively and a net use of cash of million for other working capital changes 
our investing activities used million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments  but also included purchases of property and equipment and patent additions 
financing activities provided million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
financing activities in include million in net proceeds from public offerings of our common stock in february and september and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these amounts consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock and the issuance of convertible senior notes  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase significantly in future periods due primarily to costs associated with our plans to establish a manufacturing facility for exenatide lar  which we expect to complete in phases through at an estimated cost of up to million 
we may not generate positive operating cash flows for the next few years and our ability to do so will depend on many factors including the market acceptance and the amount of product sales we achieve for byetta and symlin  costs to commercialize byetta and symlin  costs associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our ongoing and recently acquired development programs  costs for related general and administrative support  and the other factors described in this annual report  including those discussed in part i  item a under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results 
we have a loan facility available from lilly that  subject to certain defined development and regulatory events  over time could provide us up to million to fund a portion of our development and commercialization costs for byetta 
as of december   million of this facility was available to us and there were no amounts outstanding 
any loans under this facility would be secured by some of our patents and other tangible assets and  at lilly s option  are convertible into our common stock if amounts remain outstanding for more than two years 
additionally  any loans under this facility must be executed prior to may   the first anniversary of byetta s product launch in the united states  at which point of any outstanding loan amounts become due 
at december   we had outstanding long term debt of million 
this amount includes million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes issued in and due  or the notes 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
under certain circumstances  the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  on or after june   at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the remainder of our long term debt balance at december  consists of million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes issued in and due  or the notes 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
the notes are not redeemable at our option 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt inventory purchase obligations capital lease obligations operating leases total includes million of outstanding purchase orders  cancelable by us upon days written notice  subject to reimbursement of costs incurred through the date of cancellation 
excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements with other companies we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we do not expect to make any significant milestone payments under these agreements within months from the date of this annual report 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of product sales we achieve for byetta and symlin  costs associated with the commercialization of byetta and symlin  our ability to effectively market byetta and symlin  costs associated with an increase in our infrastructure  our ability to receive milestone payments or obtain access to loan amounts pursuant to our collaboration with lilly  our ability and the extent to which we establish commercialization arrangements  outside of the united states  if any  for symlin  our ability to progress with our pipeline development programs and other ongoing and new clinical and preclinical trials  progress in our other research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  changes in or new collaborative relationships  costs of manufacturing  including costs associated with obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of our products and scale up costs for our drug candidates  costs associated with the establishment of an exenatide lar manufacturing facility  the acquisition and implementation costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  and the need to repay existing indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities  asset backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities  and therefore the risk of loss due to interest rate risk is considered to be immaterial 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
at december   the fair values of our notes and notes were million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
