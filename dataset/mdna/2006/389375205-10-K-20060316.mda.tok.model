item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview introduction the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of gray television  inc the company should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview the operating revenues of the company s television stations are derived primarily from broadcast advertising revenues and  to a much lesser extent  from ancillary services such as production of commercials and tower rentals as well as compensation paid by the networks to the stations for broadcasting network programming 
broadcast advertising is sold for placement either preceding or following a television station s network programming and within local and syndicated programming 
broadcast advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured by nielsen 
in addition  broadcast advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
broadcast advertising rates are the highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a major network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most broadcast advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the net revenues of the company s television stations for the year ended december   were generated from local advertising including political advertising revenues  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts  and the remainder represented primarily by national advertising  which is sold by a station s national advertising sales representative 
the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and the stations also pay commissions to the national sales representative on national advertising 
broadcast advertising revenues are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  broadcast advertising revenues are generally higher during even numbered years due to spending by political candidates  which spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
consistent with this trend the company has not received significant political advertising revenue during the current year 
the broadcasting operations primary operating expenses are employee compensation  related benefits and programming costs 
in addition  the broadcasting operations incur overhead expenses  such as maintenance  supplies  insurance  rent and utilities 
a large portion of the operating expenses of the broadcasting operations is fixed

actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical policies that require judgments or estimations in their application where variances in those judgments or estimations could make a significant difference to future reported results 
valuation of fcc licenses as of december  the book value of the company s federal communications commission the fcc licenses and goodwill approximated billion and million respectively 
broadcast licenses of television stations acquired by the company prior to january  were valued using a residual basis methodology analogous to goodwill where the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all identified tangible and intangible assets was attributed to the broadcast license 
this residual basis approach will generally produce higher valuations of fcc licenses when compared to applying an income method as discussed below 
the company s book value for these fcc licenses approximated million as of december  the company values the broadcast licenses of any television station acquired after using an income approach 
under this approach  a broadcast license is valued based on analyzing the estimated after tax discounted future cash flows of the station  assuming an initial hypothetical start up operation maturing into an average performing station in a specific television market and giving consideration to other relevant factors such as the technical qualities of the broadcast license and the number of competing broadcast licenses within that market 
this income approach will generally produce lower valuations of fcc licenses when compared to applying a residual method as discussed above 
the company s book value for these fcc licenses approximated million as of december  at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the sec observer clarified the sec staff s position on the use of the residual method for valuation of acquired assets other than goodwill which is referred to as topic d the sec staff believed that the residual method did not comply with the requirements of sfas no 
when used to value certain intangible assets that arise from legal or contractual rights 
accordingly  the sec staff believed that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
registrants were required to apply the income approach to such assets acquired in business combinations completed after september   and perform impairment tests using an income approach on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  effective january   the company adopted the provisions of this announcement and performed a valuation assessment of its fcc licenses using the income approach 
the implementation of this pronouncement did not require the company to record an impairment charge in the first quarter of however  applying the income approach to value fcc licenses originally valued using a residual method may place a greater possibility of future impairment charges on those fcc licenses due to the inherent miss match of the fundamental assumptions between the current valuation method a hypothetical start up value in comparison to the method utilized to first establish the initial value of the fcc license a mature station s residual enterprise value 

table of contents annual impairment testing of fcc licenses and goodwill the annual impairment testing of fcc licenses and goodwill for each individual television station requires an estimation of the fair value of each fcc license and the fair value of the entire television station for evaluating goodwill 
such estimations generally rely on analysis of public and private comparative sales data as well as discounted cash flow analysis that inherently requires multiple assumptions relating to the future prospects of each individual television station including  but not limited to  the long term market growth characteristics  a station s viewing audience  station revenue shares within a market  future operating expenses  costs of capital and appropriate discount rates 
the company believes that the assumptions it utilizes in analyzing potential impairment of fcc licenses and or goodwill for each of its television stations are reasonable individually and in the aggregate 
however  these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in any one assumption  or a combination of assumptions  could produce significant differences in the calculated outcomes 
valuation of network affiliation agreements some broadcast companies may use methods to value acquired network affiliations different than those that are used by the company 
these different methods may result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets among broadcast companies 
some broadcasting companies account for network affiliations as a significant component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that stations are popular because they have generally been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcast companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
the company ascribes no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation relationship in a market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms of the affiliation agreement that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
instead  the company believes that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
the company has acquired a total of television stations since the methodology the company used to value these stations was based on the company s evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
given the company s assumptions and the specific attributes of the stations the company acquired during through  the company ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation relationship in each market beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms of the affiliation agreement that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
certain other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operational performance of that station 
as a result  the company believes that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that the company believes are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 

table of contents if the company were to assign higher values to all of its network affiliations and less value to its broadcast licenses or goodwill and if it is further assumed that such higher values of the network affiliations are definite lived intangible assets  this reallocation of value might have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
it should be noted that there is a diversity of practice and some broadcast companies have considered such network affiliation intangible asset to have a life ranging from to years depending on the specific assumptions utilized by those broadcast companies 
the following table reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations for all prior acquisitions of the company the first acquisition being in and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a hypothetical year amortization period
