we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company developing novel pharmaceuticals that are generational improvements of widely prescribed drugs in large and growing markets 
utilizing our proprietary carrierwave technology  we are currently developing new molecular entities that are derivatives of public domain actives  and attempting to address certain deficiencies associated with currently marketed drugs 
the products in our pipeline that are the most advanced in their development are nrp and nrp  which are conditionally bioreversible derivatives cbds of d amphetamine and hydrocodone  respectively  and are designed to provide overdose protection and less potential for abuse while affording comparable efficacy 
we believe some of our drugs may prove highly resistant to overdose 
we believe that we are the first company with a viable product in the pipeline attempting to address both the potential abuse and the potential overdose risk associated with currently marketed amphetamines and opioids 
throughout our history  we have incurred significant losses 
we may incur additional losses  which may increase  for our fiscal year ending december  we have not been and may never become profitable 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
revenues 
if our development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we could generate revenues from sales of our products 
if  as an alternative to commercializing a particular product  we enter into license agreements or other collaboration arrangements with corporate partners  such as our collaboration with shire pharmaceuticals group plc shire  we could recognize revenue from license fees  milestone payments  profit sharing or royalties from product sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal costs associated with patent filings and litigation that was settled in may  board of director fees  insurance expense  personnel and benefits costs  stock based compensation costs  costs associated with completing the collaboration agreements with shire  and fees charged to us by an affiliate  third security  llc third security  for services provided to us under an administrative services agreement 
administrative services that third security is providing under the administrative services agreement include support for taxation  legal  information technology  and market research functions as well as other miscellaneous services that we may need from time to time 
research and development expenses 
our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing our lead product candidates 
our research and development expenses consist of direct and indirect costs 
our direct costs include salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation  costs of materials used in research and development  costs of facilities and external development costs that consist of fees paid to professional service providers for conducting various studies and trials 
indirect costs include various overhead costs 
we believe that significant investment in product 
table of contents development is a competitive necessity  and we plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
we use our research and development employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  and many of our costs are not attributable to an individually named project but are directed to broadly applicable research efforts 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis  and we cannot state precisely the total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
the following table summarizes  from inception and for each of the past three fiscal years  the total external development costs associated with i our carrierwave technology and our earlier related iodothyronine technology  all of which costs are included in the carrierwave line item in the table below as historically we made no efforts to separate such costs  ii each of our current lead product candidates and iii other preclinical development 
fiscal years ended inception to december  january  january  january  in thousands nrp nrp other preclinical development carrierwave thyroid total we expect that the majority of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs rather than technology development 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties relating to timing and cost to completion 
we test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we expect then to conduct early stage clinical trials for each drug candidate 
we anticipate funding these trials ourselves 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the commencement and completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors  including lack of efficacy during clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  slower than expected patient recruitment  or government delays 
in addition  we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors  including results that do not support the intended safety or efficacy of our product candidates  perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to estimate accurately the specific timing and costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows  if any  from our product candidates 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in  or termination of  our clinical trials or a determination by the fda that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval  insofar as cash in flows from the relevant drug or program would be delayed or would not occur 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily consists of interest income and interest expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense consists of interest on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
we currently have no long term debt obligations 

table of contents results of operations we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  such as the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions  and the potential receipt of milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with shire 
due to these uncertainties  accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended january  from  for the fiscal year ended january  this increase was primarily attributed to a  fee paid to an investment banking firm for managing the process through which we were able to evaluate various partnering alternatives prior to successful completion of our collaboration agreements with shire  approximately  of shared marketing expenses with shire in accordance with the collaboration agreement  an increase of approximately  of payroll and benefit costs  including bonus accruals  associated with hiring executive management and accounting personnel  an increase in stock based compensation of  and a general increase in general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company  including increases in legal expenses of  and directors and officers insurance of  stock based compensation for the fiscal year ended january  was  and represents the cost of sars granted to our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer 
stock based compensation for the fiscal year ended january  was  and represented the excess of the estimated fair value of shares issued over the sales price of such shares 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended january  from  for the fiscal year ended january  an increase in external development costs of  and an increase in personnel  benefits and related costs of  including bonus accruals and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  primarily accounted for this increase 
the increase in external development costs were primarily related to phase clinical studies for our nrp compound and continued progress in our research and development of our nrp compound 
stock based compensation for the fiscal year ended january  was  and represents the cost of sars granted to our vice president  product development 
there was no stock based compensation recognized for the fiscal year ended january  related to research and development employees 
the remaining increase in personnel  benefits and related costs was due to a combination of new hires and increases in salaries and bonuses 
the following table shows the aggregate changes in our research and development expenses 
fiscal year ended research and development expenses january  january  in thousands direct project costs personnel  benefits and related costs consultants  supplies  materials and other direct costs external development costs total direct costs indirect costs total other income 
for the fiscal year ended january   other income included  of interest income earned primarily from investing the proceeds received from our initial public offering and the proceeds received pursuant to the collaboration agreements with shire

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended january  from  for the fiscal year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of  an up front fee of  paid to innovative technologies  inc innovative technologies  costs recognized for services provided by an affiliate  third security  of  an increase in personnel  benefits and related costs of approximately  and other various administrative expenses associated with being a public company 
the expenses recorded for stock based compensation were  and  for the fiscal years ended january  and december   respectively  and were based on the excess of the estimated fair value of options and shares issued over the sale price of such shares 
the up front fee of  was paid to innovative technologies on july  in accordance with the terms of an agreement the innovative technologies agreement entered into on june  that effectively amended our obligation in its entirety under previous existing agreements with innovative technologies 
the previous agreements were executed in connection with our acquisition of certain of our intellectual property from innovative technologies in prior years 
the innovative technologies agreement also provides for a royalty on net sales as defined in the innovative technologies agreement for a period of years for up to a total of million  whichever comes first 
no royalties have been paid under this agreement through january  third security provided support in the finance  accounting  taxation  legal  market research  information technology and human resources functions at no charge to us through august  and in prior periods 
through december   no charge was recorded for the estimated cost of these services 
however  due to the increased assistance that third security provided in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock that was completed on august   we recorded expenses of  for these costs and recognized a capital contribution in the same amount 
we estimated these costs based on information provided by third security that included actual compensation and estimated time incurred by individuals performing such services 
we believe that it is not practicable to estimate the cost for these services that we would have incurred if we had operated as an unaffiliated entity through august  for fiscal year and for the fiscal year ended december  upon the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock on august   third security ceased to provide these services at no charge to us 
at such time  we added executive and additional financial staff that allowed us to become self sufficient  except for certain administrative services that third security has continued to provide for a fee under the terms of an administrative services agreement 
the addition of the administrative and executive staff accounted for most of the  increase in personnel and benefits costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended january   from  for the fiscal year ended december  an increase in external development costs of  accounted for most of this increase 
most of the increase in external development costs was related to toxicity studies  pharmacokinetic studies  a c gmp production campaign for nda registration batches  phase clinical studies for our nrp compound and process development and optimization costs for our nrp compound 

table of contents the following table shows the aggregate changes in our research and development expenses 
fiscal year ended research and development expenses january  december  in thousands direct project costs personnel  benefits and related costs consultants  supplies  materials and other direct costs external development costs total direct costs indirect costs total other income 
other income for the fiscal year ended january  included a gain of  on settlement of litigation  which is discussed further in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note and  of interest income earned primarily from investing the proceeds from our initial public offering 
interest income for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately  liquidity and capital resources our operations from through january   have been funded primarily from proceeds of approximately million raised from various private placements of our common stock  million of gross proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock on august   and million received on february  in accordance with the terms of our collaboration agreements with shire  as follows number of price per fiscal year shares share gross proceeds initial public offering shire collaboration as adjusted for a one for two reverse stock split effective august  and a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend effective january  represents shares issued upon the conversion of a convertible promissory note by rjk  llc  an entity controlled by mr 
kirk  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  in the original amount of  plus accrued interest of  we received the  of proceeds from the note issuance in august on august   we completed the initial public offering of our common stock whereby we sold  shares at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we paid approximately million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred estimated other offering expenses of approximately million 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 

table of contents at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at january  our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments in money market funds and commercial paper 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we also maintained short term investments of  and  at january  and january   respectively  in auction rate municipal bonds 
we record these short term investments at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every to days  and the fact that  despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  we have the ability to liquidate readily these securities 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
cash provided by operations was  for the fiscal year ended january  compared to cash used in operations of  for the fiscal year ended january  the upfront payment of  received in february under the terms of our collaboration agreements with shire  offset by increased operating expenses primarily accounted for this change 
cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended january  and was the result of investing the proceeds from the  upfront payment received from shire 
cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended january  and was the result of investing the proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended january   which was primarily from proceeds received from exercises of stock options  and  for the fiscal year ended january   which was primarily from issuances of common stock  including approximately million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
due within total year thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations research and development contracts total contractual cash obligations the contractual commitments reflected in this table exclude royalty payments that we may be obligated to pay to innovative technologies in the future 
such future royalty payments are contingent on product sales and are based on of net sales as defined in the innovative technologies agreement for a period of years or up to a total of million  whichever occurs first 
also excluded from the table are payments that we may be obligated to make under our agreements with depomed  inc  optimer pharmaceuticals  inc  and the ernest gallo clinic research center at the university of california san francisco 
such payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones  royalties on future product sales  and development costs which are reimbursed at an fte equivalent rate or cost plus basis  the total cost of which cannot reasonably be estimated 
as of january   our long term contractual obligations consist of a capital lease for equipment used in our research operations 
our operating leases are for our research and development facilities and our administrative offices 
the lease for the research and development facilities was renewed in august for one year at a monthly rental of approximately  we may renew this lease for successive one year periods thereafter 
upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock on august   we entered into an operating lease agreement with third security for offices occupied by certain of our executive and administrative staff 
the lease is for months with a current monthly rental of approximately  we may renew this lease for three successive one year periods thereafter 
we also have in progress research and development contracts performed by third parties 
as of january   we had commitments  which consist primarily of external development work  with third parties totaling approximately  of which approximately  had not yet been incurred 

table of contents we may incur losses from operations for fiscal year we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to additional clinical trials and personnel 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand our business development  add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to being a public company 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including milestone payments received under our collaboration agreements with shire  the progress of our research and development of product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  including the million milestone payment received from shire on february   will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
effects of inflation our only liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets should not be significantly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets should not be significantly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory cost  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r will require us to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the vesting period of the 
table of contents award 
we will adopt this standard beginning with the first quarter of while we are currently evaluating the impact that adopting sfas r will have on our future financial statements  we anticipate that it will negatively impact our earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
although we currently have no products available for sale  we do anticipate having products in the future 
we anticipate that some of our sales will be to wholesalers who have the right to return purchased product 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  until we have sufficient sales history to estimate product returns  we will have to defer recognition of revenue on such sales until the products are dispensed through patient prescriptions 
once we have obtained sufficient sales history to estimate product returns  under sfas  we will be able to recognize revenue on product shipments  net of a reasonable allowance for estimated returns relating to these shipments 
our strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
such collaboration agreements may have multiple deliverables 
we evaluate multiple deliverable arrangements pursuant to eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
pursuant to eitf  in arrangements with multiple deliverables where we have continuing performance obligations  contract  milestone and license fees are recognized together with any up front payments over the term of the arrangement as performance obligations are completed  unless the deliverable has stand alone value and there is objective  reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element in the arrangement 
in the case of an arrangement where it is determined there is a single unit of accounting  all cash flows from the arrangement are considered in the determination of all revenue to be recognized 
additionally  pursuant to the guidance of sec staff accounting bulletin sab  unless evidence suggests otherwise  revenue from consideration received is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the arrangements 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as fees of lawyers and contract service fees 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimated the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such 
table of contents services are often subject to management s judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
the two factors that are most likely to affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses will be overstated or understated 
because shares of our common stock had not been publicly traded before our initial public offering in august  we valued our stock and stock option grants by considering comparative values of stock of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity of our common stock  events that have occurred since the date of grants  economic trends and transactions involving the sale of our common stock to independent third parties 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of employee stock options 
we will adopt this standard beginning with the first quarter of and are currently evaluating the expected impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  including the specific transition method to be utilized upon adoption 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will negatively impact our earnings 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the fiscal years ended january  and january  we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured 
at january   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents that have maturities of less than three months and our short term investments in auction rate municipal bonds 
we record our investment in auction rate municipal bonds at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every to days  and  the fact that  despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  the company has the ability to liquidate readily these securities 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and the reset terms of our investments in auction rate municipal bonds  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on their realized value
