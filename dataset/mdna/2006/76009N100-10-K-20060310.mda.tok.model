item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are the largest rent to own operator in the united states with an approximate market share based on store count 
at december   we operated  company owned stores nationwide and in canada and puerto rico  including stores in wisconsin operated by our subsidiary get it now  llc under the name get it now and seven stores located in canada operated by our subsidiary rent a centre  ltd  under the name rent a centre 
another of our subsidiaries  colortyme  is a national franchisor of rent to own stores 
at december   colortyme had franchised stores in states  of which operated under the colortyme name and eight stores of which operated under the rent a center name 
our stores generally offer high quality durable products such as major consumer electronics  appliances  computers  and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that generally allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period 
these rental purchase agreements are designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers by allowing them to obtain merchandise that they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit 
these agreements also cater to customers who only have a temporary need  or who simply desire to rent rather than purchase the merchandise 
rental payments are made generally on a weekly basis and  together with applicable fees  constitute our primary revenue source 
our expenses primarily relate to merchandise costs and the operations of our stores  including salaries and benefits for our employees  occupancy expense for our leased real estate  advertising expenses  lost  damaged  or stolen merchandise  fixed asset depreciation  and corporate and other expenses 
in  we began offering financial services products  such as short term secured and unsecured loans  bill paying  debit cards  check cashing and money transfer services in our existing rent to own stores under the trade name the cash advantedge 
as of december   we offered some or all of these financial services products in rent a center store locations in idaho  montana  nevada  oregon  utah and washington 
we expect to offer such financial services products in to rent a center store locations by the end of we plan to continue growing through selective and opportunistic acquisitions of existing rent to own stores  and development of new rent to own stores  as well as offering financial services products designed to appeal to our customer demographic 
we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we have sought to acquire underperforming rent to own stores to which we could apply our operating model as well as open new stores 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
typically  a newly opened rent to own store is profitable on a monthly basis in the ninth to twelfth month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved cumulative break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximate  with roughly of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
as a result  our quarterly earnings are impacted by how many new stores we opened during a particular quarter and the quarters preceding it 
because of significant growth since our formation  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and other financial data  including the rate of earnings growth  may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
in addition  we strategically open or acquire stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration 
this planned cannibalization may negatively impact our same store revenue and cause us to grow at a slower rate 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new rent to own stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 

table of contents the following discussion focuses on our results of operations  and issues related to our liquidity and capital resources 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements the statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  would  expect  intend  could  estimate  should  anticipate or believe 
we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are accurate 
however  we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur 
our actual future performance could differ materially from such statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to uncertainties regarding our ability to open new rent to own stores  our ability to acquire additional rent to own stores on favorable terms  our ability to enhance the performance of these acquired stores  our ability to control store level costs  our ability to identify and successfully market products and services that appeal to our customer demographic  our ability to identify and successfully enter into new lines of business offering products and services that appeal to our customer demographic  including our financial services products  the results of our litigation  the passage of legislation adversely affecting the rent to own or financial services industries  interest rates  our ability to enter into new and collect on our rental purchase agreements  our ability to enter into new and collect on our short term loans  economic pressures affecting the disposable income available to our targeted consumers  such as high fuel and utility costs  changes in our effective tax rate  our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls  changes in the number of share based compensation grants  methods used to value future share based payments and changes in estimated forfeiture rates with respect to share based compensation  changes in our stock price and the number of shares of common stock that we may or may not repurchase  and the other risks detailed from time to time in our sec reports 
additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies involving critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in our financial statements the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
table of contents amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
self insurance liabilities 
we have self insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability insurance policies 
we establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self insured retentions 
we make assumptions on our liabilities within our self insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts  which are prepared using methods and assumptions in accordance with standard actuarial practice  and third party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims 
during  each quarter we reevaluated our estimate of liability within our self insured retentions  including our assumptions related to our loss forecasts and estimates  using actuarial loss forecasts updated during the quarter and currently valued third party claim administrator loss estimates 
we evaluate the adequacy of our accruals by comparing amounts accrued on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third party claim administrator loss estimates  and make adjustments to our accruals as needed based upon such review 
over the previous years  our loss exposure has increased  primarily as a result of our growth 
we instituted procedures to manage our loss exposure through a greater focus on the risk management function  a transitional duty program for injured workers  ongoing safety and accident prevention training  and various programs designed to minimize losses and improve our loss experience in our store locations 
as of december   the net amount accrued for losses within our self insured retentions was million  as compared to million at december  the increase in the net amount accrued for the period is a result of an estimate for new claims expected for the current policy period  which incorporates our store growth  increased number of employees  increases in health care costs  and the net effect of prior period claims which have closed or for which additional development or changes in estimates have occurred 
litigation reserves 
we are the subject of litigation in the ordinary course of our business 
our litigation involves  among other things  actions relating to claims that our rental purchase agreements constitute installment sales contracts  violate state usury laws or violate other state laws to protect consumers  claims asserting violations of wage and hour laws in our employment practices  as well as claims we violated the federal securities laws 
in preparing our financial statements at a given point in time  we account for these contingencies pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires that we accrue for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  we make estimates of our probable liabilities  if reasonably estimable  and record such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts represent our best estimate  or may be the minimum range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
we  together with our counsel  monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  adjustments are made to reflect current facts and circumstances 
as of december   we had accrued million relating to our outstanding litigation  of which million was related to the settlement of the pucci chess matter which was funded in february  approximately million related to the prospective settlement of the rose madrigal matters  and an additional million for anticipated legal fees and expenses with respect to our other outstanding litigation  as compared to million for the year ended december   of which we had accrued million in connection with the settlement of the griego carrillo matter  and an additional million for probable litigation costs with respect to our other outstanding litigation 

table of contents the ultimate outcome of our litigation is uncertain  and the amount of loss we may incur  if any  cannot in our judgment be reasonably estimated 
additional developments in our litigation or other adverse or positive developments or rulings in our litigation  could affect our assumptions and thus  our accrual 
income tax reserves 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign income taxes 
we estimate our liabilities for income tax exposure by evaluating our income tax reserves each quarter based on the information available to us  and establishing reserves in accordance with the criteria for accrual under sfas no 
in estimating this liability  we evaluate a number of factors in ascertaining whether we may have to pay additional taxes and interest when all examinations by taxing authorities are concluded 
the actual amount accrued as a liability is based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances  a thorough research of the technical merits of our arguments  and an assessment of the chances of us prevailing in our arguments 
we consult with external tax advisers in researching our conclusions 
at december   we had accrued million relating to our contingent liabilities for income taxes  as compared to million at december  the decrease in the amount accrued for the period primarily relates to the reversal of a million state tax reserve in connection with a change in estimate as well as a million tax audit reserve associated with the favorable resolution of our and federal tax returns offset slightly by our normal tax accruals 
if we make changes to our accruals in any of these areas in accordance with the policies described above  these changes would impact our earnings 
increases to our accruals would reduce earnings and similarly  reductions to our accruals would increase our earnings 
a pre tax change of million in our estimates would result in a corresponding change in our earnings per common share 
based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of our company as of  and for  the periods presented in this report 
however  we do not suggest that other general risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired stores  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below and in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue 
merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental purchase agreements which provide for weekly  semi monthly or monthly rental terms with non refundable rental payments

rental revenue and fees are recognized over the rental term as payments are received and merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer exercises their purchase option and pays the cash price due 
revenue for the total amount of the rental purchase agreement is not accrued because the customer can terminate the rental agreement at any time and we cannot enforce collection for non payment of rents 
because get it now makes retail sales on an installment credit basis  get it now s revenue is recognized at the time of such retail sale  as is the cost of the merchandise sold  net of a provision for uncollectible accounts

on computers that are months old or older and which have become idle  depreciation is recognized using the straight line method for a period of at least six months  generally not to exceed an aggregate depreciation period of months 
the purpose is to better reflect the depreciable life of a computer in our stores and to encourage the sale of older computers

we estimated that we would incur restructuring expenses in the range of million to million  to be recorded in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ending december   based on the closing date of the stores 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million

additional costs include inventory disposals and the removal of signs and various assets from vacated locations

liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated approximately million in operating cash flow 
in addition to funding operating expenses  we used approximately million for capital expenditures  approximately million in acquisitions of existing rent to own stores  and approximately million in stock repurchases 
we ended the year with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to a decrease in net earnings  changes in deferred income taxes resulting from the reversal of the effect that the job creation and workers assistance act of had on our cash flow as discussed under deferred taxes below and changes in accrued liabilities 
the change in our accrued liabilities is primarily due to the litigation settlement accrual of million recorded in the third quarter of and then paid in cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to the acquisition of rent rite and rainbow rentals in may as well as a decrease in property assets purchased during as compared to cash used in financing activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily related to decrease in stock repurchases in as compared to liquidity requirements 
our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and implementation of our growth strategies  including store expansion and investment in our financial services business 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings and sales of debt and equity securities 
in the future  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number 
table of contents of factors  some of which relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be on terms we find acceptable 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  and our store expansion programs during our revolving credit facilities  including our million line of credit at intrust bank  provide us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million  of which million was available at march  at march   we had million in cash 
to the extent we have available cash that is not necessary to fund the items listed above  we intend to repurchase additional shares of our common stock  repurchase some of our outstanding subordinated notes  as well as make additional payments to service our existing debt 
while our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue  our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect 
if a change in control occurs  we may be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
our senior credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the subordinated notes  including in the event of a change in control 
in addition  a change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which would allow our lenders to accelerate the indebtedness owed to them 
in the event a change in control occurs  we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facility obligations and all of the subordinated notes  or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
litigation 
in november  we reached an agreement in principle to settle all of the pending lawsuits and related matters in washington brought by the plaintiffs counsel in the rose madrigal matters on an agreed state wide class basis for million 
these matters alleged violations of various provisions of washington state law regarding overtime  lunch and work breaks  failure to pay wages due to our washington employees  and various labor related matters 
in january  the court in rose madrigal preliminarily approved the class settlement 
the final approval hearing before the court is scheduled for april  to account for this prospective settlement  as well as our own attorneys fees  we accrued an aggregate of million as of december  while we believe that the terms of this settlement are fair  there can be no assurance that the settlement  if completed  will be approved by the court in its present form 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the prospective settlement without adversely affecting our liquidity 
additional settlements or judgments against us on our existing litigation could affect our liquidity 
please refer to note m of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
deferred taxes 
on march   president bush signed into law the job creation and worker assistance act of  which provides for accelerated tax depreciation deductions for qualifying assets placed in service between september  and september  under these provisions  of the basis of qualifying property is deductible in the year the property is placed in service  with the remaining of the basis depreciated under the normal tax depreciation rules 
for assets placed in service between may  and december   the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of increased the percent of the basis of qualifying property deductible in the year the property is placed in service from to 
accordingly  our cash flow benefited from the resulting lower cash tax obligations in those prior years 
we estimate that our operating cash flow  on a net cumulative basis  from the accelerated depreciation deductions on rental merchandise increased by approximately million through the associated deferred tax liabilities are expected to reverse over a three year period which began in approximately million  or  reversed in we expect that million  or  will reverse in and the remaining million will reverse in  which will result in additional cash taxes and a corresponding decrease in our deferred tax liabilities discussed above

economic conditions 
although our performance has not suffered in previous economic downturns  we cannot assure you that demand for our products  particularly in higher price ranges  will not significantly

seasonality 
our revenue mix is moderately seasonal  with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year  primarily related to federal income tax refunds 
generally  our customers will more frequently exercise their early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
furthermore  we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements on rent in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year 
as a result  we would expect revenues for the third quarter of each fiscal year to remain relatively flat with the prior quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods unless we add significantly to our store base during the third quarter of future fiscal years as a result of new store openings or opportunistic acquisitions 
effect of new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb enacted sfas r  which replaces sfas  and supersedes apb sfas r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of earnings 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see the stock based compensation section shown in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for the pro forma net earnings and earnings per share amounts for and as if we had used a fair value based method under sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
the actual effects of sfas r will depend on numerous factors  including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  the method used to value future share based payments to our employees and estimated forfeiture rates 
we will be adopting sfas r under the prospective method and estimate recognizing additional pre tax compensation expense of approximately and per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively  based on the number of options outstanding at december   and assuming that we continue to issue stock options under the plan consistent with our current policy and procedures 
the decrease in the estimated expense under sfas r  as compared to the pro forma expense shown in the stock based compensation table in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  is primarily due to methods of calculation that are permitted under sfas r versus the methods under sfas sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  whereas current accounting rules prescribe that the benefits be reported as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of  million in term loans and million in revolving credit outstanding at interest rates indexed to the eurodollar rate and million outstanding on our line of credit at interest rates discounted from prime 
the fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
the fair value of the subordinated notes at december  was million 
as of december   we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements with respect to term loans under our senior credit facilities 
market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or eurodollar rate that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have the effect of causing a million additional pre tax charge or credit to our statement of earnings than would otherwise occur if interest rates remained unchanged
