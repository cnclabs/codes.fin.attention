the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition contains statements relating to our future results  including certain projections and trends  which constitute forward looking statements 
certain risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in these forward looking statements and other disclosures 
these risks and uncertainties are more fully described under forward looking statements and exposures below 
as used herein  unless otherwise required by the context  the term grant prideco refers to grant prideco  inc and the terms we  our  and similar words refer to grant prideco and its subsidiaries 
the use herein of such terms as group  organization  we  us  our and its  or references to specific entities  are not intended to be a precise description of corporate relationships 
general we are the world leader in drill stem technology development and drill pipe manufacturing  sales and service  a global leader in drill bit technology  manufacturing  sales and service  and a leading provider of high performance engineered connections and premium tubular products and services 
we operate primarily through three business segments drilling products and services  drill bits and tubular technology and services 
additionally  our corporate and other segment now includes the results of intelliserv  which we acquired the remaining interest in september refinancing charges in  we completed a comprehensive debt restructuring program to decrease interest expense and improve flexibility 
in connection with the debt restructuring program  we incurred total refinancing charges of million  which includes million related to replacing our previous million credit facility with a new million credit facility and an early redemption of our million senior notes due and million related to the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes 
the million is comprised of million for the make whole premium on the senior notes  million related to the write off of debt issue costs associated with the previous credit facility and the senior notes  including the senior note s discount  and million related to the settlement of treasury rate locks 
the million  related to the repurchase of the senior notes  is comprised of million for the tender offer consideration and consent payment  million related to the write off of debt issue costs and million in other related fees 
acquisitions we purchased the remaining interest in grant prideco jiangsu gpj formerly known as jiangsu shuguang grant prideco tubular limited jsg effective october  for million in cash and a commitment to make subsequent investments in china 
additionally  we entered into a year non compete agreement with one of the selling shareholders for million  of which million was paid at closing and the remainder will be paid over a two year period 
on september   we acquired the remaining interest in intelliserv for million in cash plus a non interest bearing note payable of million  with million due january and million due january  which was discounted to million based on our incremental borrowing rate of 
additional contingent consideration could be paid based on the product s adoption rate and revenues 
the purchase agreement limits the total contingent consideration to million 
intelliserv  located in provo  utah  is developing a drill string telemetry network embedded within drill pipe 

table of contents on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of corion  a coring business headquartered in nisku  alberta  for approximately million in cash with up to an additional million payable upon achieving certain performance benchmarks 
corion s flagship product is the corion express  which allows an operator to drill and core without tripping the pipe  providing substantial operational savings compared with conventional coring techniques 
market trends our business primarily depends on the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling activity  which depends on capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
those companies adjust capital spending according to their expectations for oil and gas prices  which creates cycles in drilling activity 
each of our business segments generally tracks the level of domestic and international drilling activity  but their revenues  cash flows and profitability follow the rig count at different stages within these market cycles 
drill pipe demand is also a function of customer inventory levels and typically lags changes in the worldwide rig count 
in a rising market  this results in longer lead times for ordered products 
in a declining market  customers are contractually required to purchase ordered drill pipe even if they will no longer need that pipe 
this creates a situation where some customers have an inventory of excess drill pipe 
drill bit demand and this segment s earnings and cash flows have closely tracked the worldwide rig count 
within our tubular technology and services segment  there are four product lines atlas bradford premium connections  tube alloy accessories  tca premium casing and xl systems large bore connections and services 
results for this segment s atlas bradford  tube alloy and tca product lines predominantly follow changes in premium tubular markets  including north american offshore drilling in particular  the gulf of mexico and deep us gas drilling  but short term demand for atlas bradford products also can be affected by inventories at octg distributors 
the tca product line also is affected by the level of us octg mill activity 
this segment s xl systems product line generally follows the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity 
for the periods below  the revenues  profitability and cash flows from each of our business segments have been impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and rig counts 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and gas prices at the dates indicated and the north american us and canadian and international rig counts for the periods reflected year ended december  wti oil a average ending henry hub gas b average ending north american rig count c average ending international rig count c average ending a price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
b price per mmbtu as of the dates presented above 
source bloomberg energy commodity service 
c source baker hughes rig count international rig count excludes china and the former soviet union 

table of contents future market trends and expectations we anticipate future results will be based on the level of drilling activity and our customers views regarding the sustainability of that activity 
these perceptions depend on their views regarding oil and natural gas prices 
when forecasting our results for  we relied on assumptions about the market  customers and suppliers  and we also considered the company s backlog  which is at its highest level ever  and past results 
all these indicators point to increased performance in more recently  however  us natural gas prices have decreased over from their peak in december despite this decline  we have not yet seen any significant changes in our customer s spending plans 
therefore  we expect a continuation of strong worldwide drilling activity levels throughout using these indicators and assumptions  we anticipate that earnings will be another record  in the range of to per diluted share  excluding any unusual items 
our results could materially differ from these forecasts if any of our assumptions  such as customer expectations of commodity price strength or drilling activity  prove to be incorrect 
in addition  our businesses operations  financial condition and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that if realized could cause our actual results to differ substantially from our forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are further described in item a

currently  we now have nine directors  of which only three serve on weatherford s board 
in connection with the spinoff  we entered into a preferred supplier agreement with weatherford in which weatherford agreed for at least a three year period from april  which was extended to march  to purchase at least of its requirements for certain products from us 
in return  we agreed to sell those products at prices not greater than the price that we sell to similarly situated customers  and  as partial consideration for amounts due to weatherford at that time  we provided weatherford a million credit towards of purchase price of those products

the amended agreement provides for a reduced minimum annual purchase commitment through july   effective april  the amendment also provides for a surcharge provision under which actual costs of key raw materials in the green pipe production process will be indexed to the april base cost and surcharges per ton assessed accordingly for the difference 
these surcharges were phased in during and were in place beginning in although we are not contractually obligated to purchase an annual minimum quantity  the contract does include a penalty when purchases fall below a minimum level calculated using a two year average 
the maximum annual penalty due under the contract would be approximately million euros annually 
during  we met our minimum purchase requirements and we currently believe we will meet our contractual commitments for without incurring unnecessary penalties or material unnecessary inventory positions 
off balance sheet financing we do not have any off balance sheet hedging  financing arrangements or contracts except those associated with our investment in vat  which is not consolidated in our financial statements 
this investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb no

at december   unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding unvested options and our employee stock purchase plan  as determined in accordance with sfas  that we expect to record during is approximately million  before tax 
we will incur additional expense during related to new awards granted during that are not yet quantified

inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads to conversion costs 
table of contents should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on our financial statements 
the american jobs creation act of the act enacted on october  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated foreign earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  certain criteria in the act must be satisfied 
we evaluated these provisions and determined we will not repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the act 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to the drilling products and services and tubular technology and services segments  this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  the sales price is fixed or determinable  the manufacturing process is complete including completion of all proper inspections  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and all delivery obligations have been met 
if requested in writing by the customer  delivery may be satisfied through delivery to our customer storage location or to a third party storage facility 
with respect to our drill bits segment  revenue is recognized when the customer runs the drill bit 
customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale 
we also recognize revenues as services are performed 
additionally  we recognize revenues associated with rebillable shipping costs 
deferred revenues and charges for sales transactions where title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer but the supporting documentation does not meet all of the criteria for revenue recognition prior to the products being in the physical possession of the customer  the recognition of the revenues and related inventory costs from these transactions are required to be deferred until the customer takes physical possession 
at december   we had deferred revenues and charges related to such transactions of million and million  respectively 
at december   we had deferred revenues and charges of million and million  respectively 
the deferred charges represent customer owned finished goods inventory on deferred sales transactions for which legal title transfer has occurred  but the product is not yet in the customer s physical possession 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively  are provided primarily based on specific account collection issues 
the provision for bad debt expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 

table of contents inventories inventory costs are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we value our inventories primarily using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  that include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead allocations 
we perform obsolescence reviews on our slow moving and excess inventories and establish reserves based on current assessments of factors such as age of inventory  technology obsolescence  future product demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if such factors are different than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the cost of business acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using third party appraisals and management estimates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of an acquired operation or an existing operation  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration and exit plans 
valuation of long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to expected undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less selling costs 
while we believe no impairments existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to at least an annual impairment test and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second step test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the years expected to be benefited  ranging from to years 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we do not believe any of our goodwill was impaired as of december  while we believe no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates 
table of contents and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxable profitability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingent liabilities we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the actual costs of these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision to cover an expected loss based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities primarily include litigation  warranty claims  environmental liabilities and contract claims 
while management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
pension plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit pension plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations as of the period end 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that we enter into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
refer to note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information on financial instruments 
foreign currency risk the functional currency for the majority of our international operations is the us dollar 
adjustments resulting from the remeasurement of the local currency financial statements into the us dollar functional currency  which uses a combination of current and historical exchange rates  are included in the consolidated 
table of contents statements of operations in other income  net in the current period 
the functional currency of our canadian  venezuelan and chinese operations is the local currency 
adjustments resulting from the translation of the local functional currency financial statements into the us dollar  which is primarily based on current exchange rates  are included in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the current period 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  such as those resulting from the settlement of foreign receivables or payables  are included other income  net  which includes our long term supply contract with vat that is denominated in euros 
net foreign currency gains losses for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
interest rates we are and will be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following table  which presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates  summarizes our fixed rate debt obligations at december  and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
thereafter in thousands long term debt fixed rate average interest rate thereafter long term debt fixed rate average interest rate as of december   we had fixed rate debt aggregating million and variable rate debt aggregating million 
the variable rate debt exposes us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the variable interest rate were to increase by from december levels  interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
the carrying value of the variable interest rate debt approximates fair value as it bears interest at current market rates 
however  our fixed rate senior notes outstanding at december  subject us to risks related to changes in the fair value of the debt and exposes us to potential gains or losses if we were to repay or refinance such debt 
a change in market interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the fair value of financial instruments which differed from their carrying value at december  and  were as follows december  carrying fair carrying fair value value value value in millions senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due
