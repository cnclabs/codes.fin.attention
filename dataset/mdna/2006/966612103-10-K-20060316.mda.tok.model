overview natural disasters affecting whitney in two strong hurricanes affected portions of whitney s service area during in late august  hurricane katrina hit the greater new orleans area and the mississippi gulf coast  with lesser impacts on coastal alabama and the western panhandle of florida 
hurricane rita made landfall toward the end of september across the coastal area at the border of texas and louisiana  with a major impact on southwest louisiana  including the lake charles area 
these two storms caused widespread property damage  required the relocation of an unprecedented number of residents and business operations  and severely disrupted normal economic activity in the impacted areas 
governmental  private and philanthropic agencies provided significant immediate and ongoing disaster relief  including various forms of financial assistance  and numerous legislative proposals  both local and national  have been adopted or are under consideration regarding repairs and improvement to the storm protection system and long term assistance to rebuild and revitalize the disaster areas 
such proposals will inevitably address whether and how rebuilding should take place in areas still vulnerable to devastation from future storms 
this is particularly applicable both to new orleans and certain contiguous parishes  where the existing levee system did not prevent storm surge from flooding sections of the area for extended periods  and also to coastal communities with direct exposure to the gulf of mexico 
the following summarizes the more significant financial repercussions of these natural disasters for the company and the bank 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses management has been confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the recent storms on credit quality and inherent losses 
it was clear early on that the storms could have significant and long term economic repercussions  both positive and negative  for businesses and individuals in the most severely affected parts of the broader storm impact area  but it was impossible then and continues to be difficult to assess with precision the storms ultimate effect on whitney s loan collections 
to begin to address this uncertainty  loan officers completed an extensive review of the storms immediate and near term impact on individual borrowers by december  the section below on loans  credit risk management and the allowance for loan losses describes this review process and management s overall approach to assessing the storms impact on credit quality 
this assessment is still subject to significant uncertainties  both those specific to individual customers  such as the resolution of insurance claims  and those applicable to the economic recovery of the storm impact area as a whole 
in addition  information to fully assess the performance of consumer credits that had been under payment deferral programs started to become available only after the end of the allowance for loan losses at december  incorporated management s best estimate  based on available information  of inherent losses resulting from the impact of the recent storms 
as management acquires additional information to resolve some of the remaining uncertainties and obtains results of ongoing reviews of individual borrowers  the loss estimate will be revised as needed 
disaster response costs  casualty losses  business interruption and related insurance to operate in disaster response mode  the bank incurred expenses for  among other things  the use of pre designated back up data processing centers  the lease of temporary equipment and facilities  lodging and other expenses for relocated personnel  and emergency communications with customers regarding the status of bank operations 
emergency changes to the bank s normal processing and collection of cash items caused recurring delays in funds availability that had a negative impact on net interest income 
in addition  a number of the bank s facilities and their contents were damaged by the storms and the rental income from excess office space and a parking facility was temporarily disrupted 
sixteen banking facilities will require replacement  relocation or major renovation 
whitney maintains insurance for casualty losses as well as for reasonable and necessary disaster response costs and certain revenue lost through business interruption 
management believes  based on its understanding of the coverage  that collection of receivables established for insurance claims is probable 
certain additional disaster response costs and the bulk of repair and replacement costs will be incurred in the early part of and beyond  and these will be included in the insurance claims as appropriate 
management projects that current and future claims will be within policy limits  and that gains will be recognized with respect to casualty claims in future periods  but this is contingent upon reaching agreement with the insurance carriers 
through the end of  whitney expensed million of storm related disaster response costs and casualty losses 
deposit growth and liquidity management the bank experienced a rapid accumulation of deposits in the months following the storms 
total deposits at december  were up billion  or  from june  the most significant increase was in noninterest bearing demand deposits  which grew  or million  during the fourth quarter of following growth of  or million  in s third quarter 
a number of storm related factors contributed to this accumulation 
customers avoided larger recurring expenditures through payment deferral programs and service disruptions  and many customers likely took a more conservative approach to discretionary spending and increased credit purchases to conserve liquidity 
at the same time  significant disaster relief funds were available to residents in the affected areas  and a large number either remained employed or received salary continuation payments 
many residents and businesses have also received insurance settlements  although use of these funds has often been delayed because of fundamental uncertainties pertaining to the rebuilding process and insufficient resources to meet demand  and government sponsored disaster recovery contracts have provided additional liquidity to some commercial accounts 
although management expects the balances accumulated by deposit customers in the storm affected areas to reduce over time  it is difficult to predict when and to what degree  and there may be some further growth as remaining insurance claims are resolved and additional disaster recovery funds are distributed 
funds from the deposit build up were first used to reduce short term wholesale borrowings  with the remainder mainly invested in short term liquidity management securities pending better information on the volatility of these funds 
short term investments and federal funds sold totaled million at december  compared to million a year earlier 
a portion of the deposit growth also helped fund the increase in the balances of cash and cash items that resulted from storm forced changes to the bank s normal processing and collection of cash items and to its strategies for managing cash on hand in these unusual circumstances 
balances of cash on hand  cash items in process of collection and balances at financial institutions increased to million at year end from million at the end of some of this increase will continue into as the bank completes its response to certain permanent changes in its operating environment 
tax relief federal legislation passed in december provided for a tax credit to businesses in the storm affected areas based on salaries paid to dislocated employees through the end of application of this provision reduced whitney s income tax expense for by million 
highlights of financial results whitney earned million in  up from the million earned in per share earnings in were per basic share and per diluted share  each approximately higher than in the key components of s earnings performance follow o net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  increased  or million  in average earning assets were higher in and the net interest margin te widened by basis points 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were loan growth and an improved mix of earning assets  higher short term market interest rates  continued liquidity in the deposit base  including the accumulation of deposits following the storms  and active management of the pricing structure for loans and deposits 
o whitney provided million for loan losses in  and the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased during the year by million compared to year end in  the company recognized a million provision for loan losses 
the allowance at december  incorporated management s best assessment based on currently available information of the storms impact on credit quality 
during  there was a million increase in the total of loans criticized through the internal credit risk classification process  approximately half of which represented storm impacted credits 
the storms impact was not yet evident in net charge offs  which totaled million in and million in o noninterest income was little changed between and deposit service charge income decreased  or million  in higher deposit account balances maintained after the storms reduced charging opportunities for certain fees and rising short term market rates led to an increase in the earnings credit allowed against service charges on certain business deposit accounts  among other factors 
fees from bank cards were up  or million  in  on continued growth in transaction volumes 
credit related fees also showed a volume driven improvement of  or million 
in  whitney recognized an additional million in net gains from the disposition of foreclosed assets and surplus banking property and received a million distribution for its membership in an electronic payment network that was sold during the year 
o noninterest expense was  or million  higher in incremental expenses associated with acquired operations  including the amortization of intangibles  totaled approximately million in employee compensation increased  or million  including million associated with the staff of acquired operations and million of additional compensation under management incentive programs 
employee benefits expense was also up  or million  mainly related to retiree pension and health benefits and to the cost of acquired staff 
noninterest expense in included million in storm related losses  while included a million loss on the abandonment of certain facility leases and a 
million casualty loss for hurricane damage 
critical accounting policies whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the following section on loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for retirement benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plan 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of this plan see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of pension benefits recognized in earnings 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  pension cost will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
recent trends in pension costs are discussed in the section on noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance for loan losses loan portfolio developments total loans increased  or million  during although some recent growth can be attributed to disaster recovery work in the storm affected areas and increased economic activity in evacuee relocation areas served by whitney  the most significant rebuilding efforts have not yet begun and associated demand for credit will likely be spread over a number of years 
whitney acquired a million loan portfolio with destin bank in april table shows loan balances by type of loan at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
table loans outstanding by type december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate commercial  construction and other      real estate residential mortgage      individuals      total loans      the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  grew  or million  in  including approximately million from the destin bank acquisition 
overall the portfolio remained diversified  with customers in a range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation and maritime construction  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  financial services  and professional services 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
there have been no major trends or changes in the concentration mix of this portfolio category from year end the rate of commercial loan growth at the bank in will depend mainly on the economic fundamentals affecting its customers as well as on its ability to continue to develop customers in the newer parts of its market and take advantage of competitive circumstances to attract new business in its established market 
at december   outstanding loans to oil and gas industry customers represented approximately of total loans  little changed from the percentage at year end the major portion of whitney s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the bank seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
with expectations of sustained higher commodity prices  whitney has increased its attention to lending opportunities in the exploration and production sector in recent years 
outstanding loans to exploration and production companies totaled nearly one third of the industry portfolio at the end of  up from approximately one quarter at year end the bank has a petroleum engineer on staff who participates in the underwriting of loans to exploration and production customers 
management  through the bank s credit policy committee  monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly southern louisiana and houston 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled approximately million at december   including million related to the oil and gas industry 
substantially all such shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for construction and real estate development  both commercial and residential  loans secured by multi family residential properties  and loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations 
this portfolio sector grew  or million  in the destin bank acquisition added approximately million to this category in  with construction and real estate development loans making up three quarters of the total 
whitney continues to develop new business in this highly competitive sector throughout its market area in addition to financing new projects for its established customer base 
the more recent activity in this portfolio sector has been driven by condominium and apartment projects and single family residential development  particularly in the eastern gulf coast region  and by the development of retail  office and industrial properties by customers throughout whitney s market area 
at the same time  financing activity for hotel and other hospitality industry projects  which have largely been concentrated in the new orleans metropolitan area  has slowed 
the future pace of new real estate project financing will reflect the level of confidence by whitney and its customers in the sustainability of favorable economic conditions 
the rate of portfolio growth in a given period will also be affected by the refinancing of seasoned income properties in the secondary market and payments on residential development loans as inventory is sold 
the bank s credit policy committee has also set exposure guidelines for the overall portfolio of commercial real estate loans as well as for loans to developers or owner users that are secured by various subcategories of property 
as with lending to the oil and gas industry  management regularly monitors real estate industry fundamentals and portfolio credit quality 
the residential mortgage loan portfolio grew by  or million  from the end of to year end  with most of this growth from the destin acquisition 
in the last two years  whitney has increased the promotion of tailored mortgage products that are held in the portfolio  although it continues to sell most conventional residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market 
this portfolio sector had declined for several years through as many loans refinanced in a favorable rate environment while new production was sold 
there was little change in the total of fixed term home equity loans outstanding during growth in this product slowed as borrowers increasingly tapped home equity when refinancing their primary home mortgages in recent years 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line loan products other than fixed term home equity loans 
this portfolio sector has grown moderately for several years  mainly from the promotion of secured personal credit lines and acquisitions

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee is composed of the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the president and the chairman and chief executive officer 
commercial credits  including commercial real estate loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
commercial loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with the support of automated credit scoring tools  with appropriate secondary review procedures 
a strong monitoring process is the key to early identification of problem credits 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a quarterly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and assigns relationships to the special credits department when appropriate 
management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk in the portfolio is reflected in the estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance encompasses three elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality and groups of homogeneous loans not individually rated  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 
criticized loans are credits with above average weaknesses as identified through the internal risk rating process 
criticized loans include those that are deemed to be impaired as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specific allowances are determined for impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or  when available  the loan s observable market price 
the allowance for the remainder of criticized loans is calculated by applying loss factors to loan balances aggregated by the severity of the internal risk rating 
the loss factors applied to criticized loans are determined with reference to the results of migration analysis  which analyzes the charge off experience over time for loans within each rating category 
for the second element  loans assessed as having average or better credit quality with similar risk ratings and homogeneous loans not subject to individual rating  such as residential mortgage loans  consumer installment loans and draws under consumer credit lines  are grouped together and individual loss factors are applied to each group 
the loss factors for homogeneous loan groups are based on average historical charge off information 
industry based factors are applied to other portfolio segments for which migration analysis has not been implemented 
determining the final element of the allowance involves assessing how other current factors  both internal and external  impact the accuracy of results obtained for the other two elements 
internally  management must consider whether trends have been identified in the quality of underwriting and loan administration as well as in the timely identification of credit quality issues 
management also monitors shifts in portfolio concentrations and other changes in portfolio characteristics that indicate levels of risk not fully captured in the loss factors 
external factors include local and national economic trends  as well as changes in the economic fundamentals of specific industries that are well represented in whitney s customer base 
management has established procedures to help ensure a consistent approach to this inherently judgmental process over time 
management s assessment of storms impact on credit quality and related uncertainties management has been confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the recent storms impact on credit quality and inherent losses 
it was clear early on that the storms could have significant and long term economic repercussions  both positive and negative  for businesses and individuals in the most severely affected parts of the broader storm impact area  but it was impossible then and continues to be difficult to assess with precision the storms ultimate effect on whitney s loan collections 
based on information as of december   management has estimated that loans to customers with some level of operations in or resident in the impacted areas totaled billion 
further analysis showed that the composition of these loans generally reflects the composition of the entire portfolio  which is over weighted toward commercial and commercial real estate loans 
by the end of  loan officers had made individual assessments of the immediate and near term effect of the storms on a substantial number of the commercial and commercial real estate loan customers in the impact areas and had initiated risk rating changes as needed  with confirmation of the conclusions by the credit review function 
approximately three fourths of this component of the storm impacted portfolio consists of large relationships individually in excess of million  although the cutoff for individual review was set much lower 
the results from this large scale review were extrapolated to the portion of the storm impacted portfolio not reviewed  including those reviewed loans for which the officers conclusions were not yet confirmed by credit review 
whitney s commercial relationships include many larger corporate borrowers with significant resources who serve multiple market areas  have the ability to shift physical operations and are backed by strong guarantors 
the loan officers reviews generally confirmed management s expectation that most of these customers would show limited immediate or near term adverse effects from the storms 
whitney s customers in heavy industry and manufacturing are mainly located in areas that did not suffer severe effects from the storms  although the ratings on two larger relationships did receive storm related downgrades to criticized classifications  with one identified as nonperforming 
there was serious disruption to oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico  mainly from hurricane rita 
although some damage and lost capacity was noted among whitney s exploration and production customer base  no significant long term business impact or reduction in the customers ability to service the debt was indicated 
repair work to production facilities and pipelines has led to increased business for a number of whitney s borrowers in the service sector of the oil and gas industry 
certain larger noncorporate commercial customers  including educational institutions and certain public entities  did experience substantial property damage and or disruptions to operations  and risk ratings were updated after considering both the immediate financial stress and the likely success of steps taken to ensure long term viability 
in the review of larger commercial real estate loans secured by income producing properties  close attention was paid to loans financing hotel operations in the new orleans area 
overall  the properties financed by whitney received relatively little damage and their rooms have been filled with contractors  government workers and displaced residents since shortly after the storms 
the reviews did identify one hotel property that has encountered delays in reopening and the related loan was rated as warranting special attention 
tourism is an important facet of the new orleans economy  and the city s success in revitalizing this industry and hosting conventions will be important to hotel operators and others in the hospitality industry over the long term 
management is guardedly optimistic that this revitalization is on track and that the obstacles contributing to current labor shortages  such as the availability of affordable housing  can be overcome 
loan officer reviews covered many middle market and small business loans  including those secured by smaller retail or office properties 
these loans made up approximately one fourth of the storm impacted commercial and commercial real estate portfolio at year end there is a diverse mix of customers in this portfolio segment  including a variety of retail and wholesale merchants  restaurants  and professional and other service providers  among others 
the officer reviews did not reveal any immediately apparent storm related concentrations of increased credit risk within the portfolio  and individual customers who were severely impacted are being closely monitored as they work through insurance claims  evaluate their continued viability  and develop strategies for recovery if feasible 
management recognizes that such smaller businesses and smaller real estate leasing operations tend to have more limited resources and operating flexibility than larger businesses  and are more susceptible to the risks posed by what could be a prolonged recovery period and eventual shrinkage in the economies of impacted markets 
loan officers will continue to watch closely for signs of additional stress in this portfolio segment 
the detailed review process applied to commercial and commercial real estate loans was not logistically feasible for the residential mortgage and consumer credit components of the storm impacted portfolio  which was estimated to total million as of december  in addition  payment deferral programs offered by the bank and other lenders have temporarily impaired the usefulness of statistics traditionally used to monitor credit quality in these portfolios 
these portfolios were segmented using pre storm risk characteristics  such as credit scores  and the type of collateral securing the loans  if any 
management assumed different levels of storm related credit deterioration for the various segments and applied incremental loss factors to loans totaling approximately million out of the total identified for the storm impacted portfolio 
in developing its assumptions  management considered a number of factors  including the historically strong credit risk profile of the bank s consumer loan customer base  the established criteria used to underwrite consumer credits  the limited information that was available from contact with borrowers since the storms  and knowledge that the storms impact on the financial capacity of individual borrowers has varied dramatically 
significant uncertainties remain regarding the performance of residential mortgage loans and other consumer credits 
instability in the job market and the possibility of additional relocations can undermine individual borrowers financial well being and their ability to repay debts 
although much progress has been made  a number of residential mortgage customers and other secured borrowers have yet to resolve outstanding insurance claims 
more importantly  decisions to repair or rebuild damaged residences are being delayed pending the issuance of updated flood maps  the completion of deliberations that will help determine community redevelopment plans  and the finalization of rules governing the distribution of federal disaster relief grants to homeowners 
because the disaster recovery process will be lengthy and the long term economic impact will remain unclear for some time  management will continue its process for assessing the storms impact on credit quality until the significant remaining uncertainties are resolved 
with additional information from ongoing reviews by loan officers and the availability of meaningful consumer portfolio performance statistics  management s estimate of the storms impact on loan losses will be refined  and any related revisions in the allowance calculation will be reflected in the provision for loan losses as they occur 
credit quality statistics and components of allowance for loan losses table provides information on nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets for each of the five years in the period ended december  nonperforming loans are included in the criticized loan total discussed below and encompass substantially all loans separately evaluated for impairment 
approximately one third of the million increase in nonperforming loans during came from the identification of storm impacted credits 
an additional million was added because of increased concerns unrelated to the storms about one commercial customer in an industry to which the bank has no other significant exposure

larger storm impacted credits identified for special attention totaled approximately million  and the destin bank acquisition added approximately million to this rating category 
the allowance determined for criticized loans at december   other than those separately evaluated for impairment  was approximately million greater than that determined at year end the allowance for impaired loans increased million from the end of to year end at december   management had also established a million allowance with respect to unidentified criticized loans and other rating downgrades that were estimated by extrapolation from the results of the storm impact reviews 
before adjustment for management s assessment of the storms impact  the allowance for loans with average or better credit quality ratings and loans not subject to individual rating increased million from the end of to december   mainly driven by loan growth 
regular adjustments to loss factors for certain smaller portfolio segments also contributed to the increase in the allowance 
management s storm impact assessment added approximately million to the allowance for these components of the portfolio  mainly related to unsecured consumer loans 
the overall allowance determined as of december  was million higher than the allowance at year end this included approximately million related to management s relative assessment of economic and other qualitative risk factors between these dates  mainly reflecting uncertainty about the longer term economic impact of the storms and the continued appropriateness of historical loss factors

the estimated duration of the overall investment portfolio was years at december   and would extend to years assuming an immediate basis point increase in market rates  according to the company s asset liability management model 
duration provides a measure of the sensitivity of the portfolio s fair value to changes in interest rates 
at december   the portfolio s estimated duration was years 
securities available for sale made up the bulk of the total investment portfolio at december  there was a net unrealized loss on this portfolio segment of million at year end gross losses totaled million and were mainly related to mortgage backed securities and certain longer maturity u 
s 
government agency securities 
the gross losses represented a little over of the total amortized cost for the underlying securities 
note to the consolidated financial statements located in item provides information on the process followed by management to evaluate whether unrealized losses on securities  both those available for sale and those held to maturity  represent impairment that is other than temporary and that should be recognized with a charge to operations 
substantially all the unrealized losses at december  resulted from increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
management identified no value impairment related to credit quality in the portfolio  and no value impairment was evaluated as other than temporary 
at december   whitney held no securities issued by local governmental units for areas significantly impacted by the storms 
the company does not normally maintain a trading portfolio  other than holding trading account securities for short periods while buying and selling securities for customers 
such securities  if any  are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
apart from securities issued or guaranteed by the u 
s 
government or its agencies  whitney held no investment in the securities of a single issuer at december  that exceeded of its shareholders equity 
deposits and borrowings deposits at december  were up  or billion  from the level at year end the destin bank locations acquired in held million in deposits at december  as discussed earlier in the overview section  there was a rapid accumulation of deposits in the months following the storms

noninterest bearing demand deposits increased  or billion  from the end of  with approximately billion of this growth coming since the second quarter of lower cost interest bearing deposits  which exclude time deposits  grew  or million  in  substantially all during the second half of the year 
noninterest bearing demand deposits increased to of total deposits at december  from a year earlier  while total lower cost deposits held relatively steady at a little over three quarters of total deposits 
movement among the different lower cost interest bearing deposit categories since year end partly reflected the management of the pricing structure for the different products 
the destin bank locations acquired in held million in lower cost deposits at december  higher cost time deposits at december  were up  or million  compared to year end time deposits at the acquired destin bank locations totaled million at year end time deposits of  and over include competitively bid public funds and excess funds of certain commercial and private banking customers that are maintained in treasury management deposit products pending redeployment for corporate or investment purposes 
whitney has attracted these funds partly as an alternative to other short term borrowings 
customers held million of funds in treasury management deposit products at december   up million from december  public fund time deposits totaled million at year end  which was million higher than the previous year end 
table maturities of time deposits deposits of deposits of  less than in thousands or more  total three months or less    over three months through six months    over six months through twelve months    over twelve months    total    short term and other borrowings at december  were down  or million  from year end the main source of short term borrowings has been the sale of securities under repurchase agreements to customers using whitney s treasury management sweep product 
the total of borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements declined approximately  or million  from year end to the end of  but increased on average in because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings serve as a relatively stable source of funds 
as noted earlier  funds from the post storm accumulation of deposits were first used to reduce short term wholesale borrowings 
the bank had eliminated its borrowings under short term advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb by the end of in  the bank had begun using these advances as an additional source of short term funds to support loan growth  and borrowings from the fhlb totaled million at december  other sources of wholesale short term funding include federal funds purchased and brokered repurchase agreements 
additional information on borrowings  including yields and maximum amounts borrowed  is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity totaled million at december   which represented an increase of million from the end of the million shares issued in the destin acquisition in may were valued at million 
whitney repurchased million of its common shares during at a cost of million 
the company retained million of earnings  net of dividends declared  but this was partly offset by an million decrease in other comprehensive income representing an unrealized net holding loss on securities available for sale during whitney recognized million in additional equity during from activity in stock based compensation plans for employees and directors  including option exercises 
total shareholders equity grew million in  to million at december  net retained earnings of million and million in additional equity from stock based compensation plan activity during were partly offset by an million other comprehensive loss 
whitney issued million shares in the madison acquisition in august which were valued at million 
the company repurchased million shares in at a cost of million 
the company declared dividends during that represented a payout totaling of earnings for the year 
the dividend payout ratio was in and in the ratios in table indicate that the company remained strongly capitalized at december  the decrease in the various ratios from year end reflected both the planned reduction in absolute capital levels through the stock repurchase program that was completed in and an increase in both risk weighted assets and average assets used to calculate the leverage ratio 
the increase in assets resulted mainly from an increase in loans  including those acquired with destin  although storm related additions to cash items in process of collection and short term investments were other important factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in business acquisitions are excluded from risk weighted assets 
these intangible assets  however  are also deducted in determining regulatory capital and thereby serve to offset the addition to capital for the value of shares issued as consideration for the acquisition

liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not currently anticipated 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the earlier overview section and the section above on deposits and borrowings discuss changes in these liability funding sources in whitney national bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of fhlb advance products as an alternative source of funds  and the bank increased its use of this funding source during and early parts of in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this ability to date 
as discussed in the earlier overview section  the bank experienced a rapid accumulation of deposits in the months following the storms 
funds from the deposit build up were first used to reduce short term wholesale borrowings  with the remainder mainly invested in short term liquidity management securities pending better information on the volatility of these funds 
a portion of the deposit growth also helped fund the increase in the balances of cash and cash items that resulted from storm forced changes to the bank s normal processing and collection of cash items and to its strategies for managing cash on hand in these unusual circumstances 
some of the increase in cash items will continue into as the bank completes its response to certain permanent changes in its operating environment 
although management expects the balances accumulated by deposit customers in the storm affected areas to reduce over time  it is difficult to predict when and to what degree  and there may be some further growth as remaining insurance claims are resolved and additional disaster recovery funds are distributed 
management is monitoring changes in this portion of the deposit base as part of its liquidity management process 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows located in item present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  at december   whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases or other corporate uses  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
whitney has announced an agreement to acquire first national bancshares  inc for stock and cash in a transaction expected to close in the second quarter of the cash component of the purchase price will total up to approximately million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due from the company under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section on deposits and borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows

b obligations under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are not included 
the company does not anticipate making a pension contribution during  and does not anticipate any significant near term payments under the unfunded nonqualified pension plan 
a million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments dollars in thousands commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than total year years years years loan commitments revolving      loan commitments nonrevolving    credit card and personal credit lines   standby and other letters of credit    total      revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
many such commitments are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
the company has historically had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity by running net interest income simulations and monitoring the economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s asset liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  and decrease million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased  respectively  from current rates by basis points 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses current growth forecasts and assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or 
at the end of each year  additional simulations were run applying instantaneous parallel rate shocks up to basis points as well as gradual rate changes of up to basis points 
the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads  and the level of success of asset liability management strategies implemented 
the method used for measuring longer term interest rate risk is the economic value of equity analysis 
at year end  the simulated measure of the company s sensitivity was acceptable under internal guidelines at all levels of rate shock 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item contain information regarding fair values 
the bank has used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to bring the market risk associated with the longer duration fixed rate loans desired by some customers in line with whitney s asset liability management objectives 
no interest rate swap agreements were in effect at december   and swap activity has had minimal impact on financial condition and results of operations 
other than this swap activity  the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
results of operations net interest income te whitney s net interest income te increased million  or  in compared to average earning assets were higher in and the net interest margin te widened basis points 
the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were loan growth  including growth through acquisitions  an improved mix of earning assets  higher short term market interest rates  active management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits  and continued liquidity in the deposit base 
tables and provide details on the components of the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
average loans  which in table include loans held for sale  increased in and comprised of average earning assets for the year  up from in rising benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio were evident in the basis point improvement in loan yields te between and after several years of sustained low market interest rates  short term rates began to increase in mid prompting an increase in bank prime rates totaling basis points by the end of and another basis points by year end balances of loans with adjustable rates tied to short term market rate indices or prime totaled close to of the dollar value of the portfolio at the end of both and the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio is less responsive to changes in market rates and fluctuated within a narrow range during and  declining basis points between these periods 
as discussed earlier  whitney increased its investment in short term liquidity management instruments in response to the rapid build up of the deposit base after the storms in  although such investments comprised only of average earning assets for the year 
the overall yield te on average earning assets was in compared to in  an increase of basis points 
the overall cost of funds increased basis points between and whitney continued to manage the rate structure for its different deposit products during in an effort to control the impact of upward pressure on funding rates that has continued to build with rising short term market rates and pricing for competitive financial products 
the overall rate on interest bearing deposits other than time deposits increased basis points in compared to rates paid on time deposits  and in particular time deposits of  or more  increase at a more rapid rate  reflecting in part the cost of attracting public funds and excess liquidity from certain corporate and private banking customers as noted earlier in the section on deposits and borrowings 
the rate on large time deposits in was up basis points compared to the rate on short term and other borrowings  which are most sensitive to market rate changes  increased basis points between and changes in the mix of funding sources have a significant impact on the direction of the overall cost of funds 
there was a small favorable shift in the overall funding mix in compared to  mainly reflecting the rapid build up of lower cost deposits in after the late summer storms 
average noninterest bearing deposits funded of average earning assets in  up from in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources increased to in from in the prior year 
within interest bearing sources of funds  there has been some shift toward higher cost sources  which include time deposits and short term and other borrowings 
higher cost sources of funds totaled of average earning assets in and in  while funding from lower cost interest bearing deposits decreased to of earning assets in from in whitney s ability to maintain a favorable mix and cost of funding sources over the long term will depend on  among other factors  its continued success in retaining and growing the deposit base in a highly competitive environment and in managing its deposit pricing structure as rates rise on alternative financial products

net interest income te increased million  or  in  consistent with the rate of growth in average earning assets from the net interest margin te was essentially stable between these periods 
the important factors behind this increase were substantially the same as those underlying the increase in net interest income in as noted earlier 
average loans grew by in and comprised of average earning assets for the period  up from in a further shift to variable pricing within the loan portfolio in and the concentration of loan growth in high quality commercial credits contributed to a basis point decline in annual yield te on the loan portfolio between and this trend to variable pricing also positioned the portfolio for more rapid yield improvement with rising short term market rates  as was evident in the basis point increase in the loan portfolio yield te from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of as noted earlier  adjustable rate loans totaled close to of the dollar value of the portfolio at year end the adjustable rate total at the end of was closer to of the portfolio 
the average yield te on the investment portfolio was again relatively stable between and  declining only basis points 
the overall yield te on average earning assets was in compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
with rising market rates  the overall earning asset yield increased basis points during the second half of compared to the yield in s second quarter 
the overall cost of funds decreased basis points between and as with earning assets  however  the cost of funds increased in the latter part of with rising short term market rates 
whitney s management of the deposit pricing structure helped limit this increase between the second and fourth quarters of to basis points 
the cost of interest bearing deposits declined basis points in  but increased basis points during the second half of the year 
substantially all of this increase was from a basis point increase in the rate paid on time deposits  which partly reflected a higher level of public funds in the deposit base as well as the cost structure of deposits acquired in a business combination in the third quarter of the overall interest cost on short term and other borrowings was most sensitive to market rate changes  increasing basis points between and and basis points from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of provision for loan losses whitney provided million for loan losses in  and the allowance for loan losses increased during the year by million compared to year end the allowance at december  incorporated management s best assessment based on currently available information of the impact of the recent storms on credit quality

account maintenance fees for business customers were down  or million  in  after decreasing  or million  in the fees charged on a large number of business accounts are based on an analysis of account activity  and these accounts are allowed to offset accumulated charges with an earnings credit based on balances maintained in the account 
the rate used to calculate the earnings credit is based on short term market rates 
analysis account fees declined  or million  in  and  or million  in  reflecting in large part the increase in the earnings credit rate beginning with the latter half of analysis fee income in recent years has also been negatively impacted by higher levels of liquidity in the deposit base  some reduction in the volume of chargeable transactions  and the migration of customers with lower transaction volumes to fixed fee business account products 
total fixed fee account fees  though still small relative to total analysis fees  increased in and in personal account service charges were lower in both and  by 
million and 
million  respectively 
these reductions largely reflect the loss of lower balance customers to competitive no fee account products  which have been aggressively promoted in parts of whitney s market area 
charges earned on specific transactions and services in were down million compared to  substantially all related to fees for items returned for insufficient funds and for overdrafts 
although broad trends in how customers execute transactions have been reducing charging opportunities  the decrease in fees during was for the most part a function of the higher deposit account balances maintained after the storms by customers in the areas most impacted 
the earlier section on deposits and borrowings discussed the factors behind this accumulation of deposit balances 
this phenomenon and the reduction in deposit charges earned continued into early in  charges earned on specific transactions and services increased 
million compared to  reflecting improved pricing and expanded services from the earlier period 
bank card fees increased  or million  in and  or million  in this income category includes fees from activity on bank issued debit and credit cards 
debit card fee income was up  or million  in  on a increase in transaction volume compared to over half of the volume increase came in the last quarter of  indicating in part a change in payment behavior within the customer base dislocated by the late summer storms 
debit card fee income increased  or 
million  in when transaction volume rose 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  generally consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in trust service fees increased in  driven mainly by new business 
this followed a increase in compared to that reflected both new business and improved equity market valuations relative to the earlier period 
during  whitney positioned additional relationship officers to attract and service trust and wealth management customers across its market area 
fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations increased in the addition of destin bank s mortgage operations and the allocation of additional resources to selected parts of whitney s market helped generate an increase in overall home loan production in production in storm impacted areas was disrupted for a period  but the impact was not significant to overall operations 
these disruptions did  however  delay the completion of a number of loan sales  caused the renegotiation of sales contracts and reduced profitability 
completed sales of home loans totaled approximately million in  million in and million in the fall off in sales from to mainly reflected a decrease in production from refinancing activity  and fee income in decreased million to a level less than half that generated in although rates remained low during from a historical perspective  they could not stimulate refinancing activity by homeowners to the levels seen in when such activity made up of the total dollar volume of whitney s originations 
credit related fees include fees on letters of credit and unused commercial credit lines 
the  or million  increase in this income category in was mainly a function of the increased volume of credit facilities granted and outstanding 
investment services income increased in following a decrease in compared to investment services include stock brokerage and annuity sales as well as fixed income securities transactions for correspondent banks and other commercial and personal customers 
the addition of destin s operations fueled the income improvement in market conditions in both and dampened the demand for fixed income transactions among whitney s customer base 
the destin acquisition added 
million in fees from insurance services to the total for other fees and charges 
the decline in this income category from to reflected the elimination of revenues from an outsourcing agreement that was cancelled 
in the first quarter of  pulse eft association was sold to discover financial services 
as a member of the pulse electronic payment network  whitney received distributions totaling approximately million that were reported with other operating income for other operating income for included a gain of million recognized on the sale of a portfolio of seasoned loans originated under affordable housing programs 
the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that varies from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales

noninterest expense increased  or million  in  following an increase of  or million  between and incremental operating costs associated with acquired operations  including the amortization of acquired intangibles  totaled approximately million in and million in storm related losses of million were included in noninterest expense in representing in part the deductibles on whitney s insurance policies 
certain categories of recurring noninterest expense were reduced in the period following the storms as a result of facility closings  service interruptions  and increased employee turnover during the relocation of new orleans based operations 
the company is working diligently to revise its disaster recovery plans and operating arrangements before the start of the hurricane season to address what shortcomings were exposed during this unprecedented crisis 
in addition  management is developing longer range plans designed to make whitney s operations more resilient  with less exposure of critical operations to disasters of any type 
these initiatives will lead to some recurring increase in operating expense  but they should also significantly reduce the direct and indirect costs associated with future natural disasters 
although management believes that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available  the cost of coverage to the company could increase sharply in the short term

whitney s full time equivalent staff grew on average by approximately in and in  substantially all related to acquisitions  through there was some branch expansion and strategic placement of additional relationship officers 
most of the storm related attrition toward the end of is expected to be restored in the early part of employees earned an additional million under sales based incentive plans during compared to  of which approximately 
million was earned by the staff of acquired operations 
in  compensation earned under these incentive plans was million less than in incentive pay for residential mortgage loan production was the main factor  reflecting the significant decrease between these periods in loan origination volumes 
compensation expense associated with management incentive programs increased by million in this increase mainly related to the cash bonus incentive program and reflected whitney s performance  as adjusted for certain storm related items  in relation to its designated peer group  an increased emphasis on performance based pay in the overall compensation packages for top management  and expanded management participation in the program 
between and  there was a million increase in the expense for management incentive programs  with stock based compensation the main factor 
whitney has recognized stock based compensation expense with respect to performance based restricted stock grants
