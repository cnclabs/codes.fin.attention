rio vista owns and operates lpg terminal facilities in brownsville  texas the brownsville terminal facility and in matamoros  tamaulipas  mexico the matamoros terminal facility and approximately miles of pipelines the us mexico pipelines which connect the brownsville terminal facility to the matamoros terminal facility 
the primary market for rio vista s lpg is the northeastern region of mexico  which includes the states of coahuila  nuevo leon and tamaulipas 
rio vista believes it has a competitive advantage in the supply of lpg for the northeastern region of mexico because of rio vista s pipeline and terminal facilities and its long term lpg supply agreement with penn octane which allow rio vista to bring supplies of lpg close to consumers of lpg in major cities in that region at competitive prices 
rio vista s primary customer for lpg is pmi trading limited pmi 
pmi is a subsidiary of petroleos mexicanos  the state owned mexican oil company  which is commonly known by its trade name pemex 
pmi is the exclusive importer of lpg into mexico

the purchase price of the lpg from penn octane is determined based on the cost of lpg under penn octane s agreements with its lpg suppliers for volumes sold to rio vista for sale to pmi or to other rio vista customers  other direct costs related to pmi and other lpg sales of rio vista and a formula that takes into consideration operating costs of penn octane and rio vista 
rio vista provides products and services through a combination of fixed margin and fixed price contracts 
costs included in cost of goods sold  other than the purchase price of lpg  may affect actual profits from sales  including costs relating to transportation  storage  leases and maintenance 
historically  until the date of the spin off  penn octane sold lpg primarily to pmi 
penn octane has a long term lease agreement  expiring in december  for approximately miles of pipeline the leased pipeline which connects exxonmobil corporation s exxon king ranch gas plant in kleberg county  texas and duke energy s la gloria gas plant in jim wells county  texas  to rio vista s brownsville terminal facility 
in connection with penn octane s lease agreement for the leased pipeline  penn octane may access up to million gallons of storage located in markham  texas the markham storage  as well as other potential propane pipeline suppliers  via approximately miles of pipeline located between markham  texas and the exxon king ranch gas plant 
penn octane s long term supply agreements in effect as of december  with exxon requires penn octane to purchase minimum quantities of lpg totaling up to million gallons of lpg per month although actual quantities supplied under such agreement for the year ended december  averaged approximately million gallons of lpg per month 
lpg sales the following table shows rio vista s actual volumes sold to pmi in gallons and average sales price for lpg for the period beginning when operations commenced october  through december  and the year ended december   and actual sales to pmi by penn octane for the period prior to the commencement of rio vista s operations in gallons and average sales price for lpg for the comparative period october  through december  and the year ended july  penn octane changed its fiscal year end from july to december  during december 
penn octane period october  through december  penn octane year ended july  rio vista period october  through december  rio vista year ended december  volume sold lpg millions of gallons pmi average sales price lpg per gallon pmi 
table of contents recent trends 
since april  pmi has contracted with either penn octane or rio vista subsequent to the spin off for volumes which were significantly lower than amounts purchased by pmi in similar periods during previous years  and beginning in april margins have been significantly lower than historic levels 
see liquidity and capital resources sales to pmi below 
rio vista believes that the reduction of volume commitments and margins for april through march is based on additional lpg production by pemex being generated from the burgos basin field in reynosa  mexico  an area within the proximity of rio vista s matamoros terminal facility and increased competition from us suppliers see below 
although rio vista is not aware of the total amount of lpg actually being produced by pemex from the burgos basin  it is aware that pemex has constructed and is operating two new cryogenic facilities at the burgos basin which it believes may have a capacity of producing up to million gallons of lpg per month 
rio vista also believes that pemex intends to install two additional cryogenic facilities  with similar capacity  to be operational in rio vista is not aware of the capacity at which the current cryogenic facilities are being operated 
furthermore  rio vista is not aware of the actual gas reserves of the burgos basin or the gas quality  each of which could significantly impact lpg production amounts 
during june  valero lp  valero began operation of a newly constructed lpg terminal facility in nuevo laredo  mexico and a newly constructed pipeline connecting the terminal facility in nuevo laredo  mexico to existing pipelines in juarez  texas which connect directly to valero energy corporation s corpus christi  texas and three rivers  texas refineries 
valero originally contracted with pmi under a five year agreement to deliver approximately million gallons of which million gallons were previously delivered by truck from three rivers  texas of lpg per month 
during july  valero announced that it had entered into a new agreement with pmi which provides for double the amount of lpg previously contracted for with pmi 
during  a pipeline operated by el paso energy between corpus christi  texas and hidalgo county  texas was closed 
historically these facilities had supplied approximately million gallons of lpg per month to rio vista s strategic zone 
rio vista is not aware of any future plans for these facilities 
during  pmi constructed and began operations of a refined products cross border pipeline connecting a pipeline running from pemex s cadereyta refinery in monterey  mexico to terminal facilities operated by transmontaigne  inc  in brownsville  texas 
the pipeline crosses the us mexico border near the proximity of rio vista s us mexico pipelines 
in connection with the construction of the pipeline  pmi utilizes an easement from rio vista for an approximate acre portion of the pipeline 
under the terms of the easement  pmi has agreed that it will not transport lpg through october  
table of contents results of operations rio vista commenced operations on october  the following discussion of revenues is based on a comparison of rio vista s sales to pmi for the period october  through december  and the year ended december  to sales made to pmi by penn octane during the period october  through december  and the year ended july   respectively

mexican income tax 
rio vista incurred  of mexican income tax expense related to its mexican subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources general 
rio vista commenced operations on october  and only had nominal cash at the time of the spin off 
rio vista pays all of its direct costs and expenses  and rio vista reimburses penn octane for cost and expenses paid by penn octane on behalf of rio vista 
as discussed below  rio vista sells lpg to pmi and purchases the lpg from penn octane 
rio vista s lpg supply agreement with penn octane provides that it pays penn octane for lpg purchased upon receipt of the proceeds from sales to pmi 
rio vista intends to distribute any available cash as defined in its partnership agreement to its unitholders on a quarterly basis 
rio vista has a loss from operations for the year ended december  and has a deficit in working capital 
rio vista is dependent on penn octane s ability to deliver adequate quantities of lpg at an acceptable price for ultimate sale to pmi  to provide credit to rio vista for such purchases and to provide management of its operations 
currently  rio vista s only source of revenue is from sales of lpg to pmi and it operates under a short term sale agreement with pmi which provides for monthly volumes which are materially less than penn octane s historical monthly volumes and margins 
as a result  penn octane s and rio vista s gross profit have been materially reduced and may continue to decline and their cash flow and available credit may be insufficient to absorb such additional reductions in gross profit 
the lpg asset sale has not closed and the transmontaigne note will be due on the earlier of the time of closing or days following demand by transmontaigne see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
rio vista has guaranteed certain of penn octane s obligations 
substantially all of rio vista s and penn octane s assets are pledged or committed to be pledged as collateral on million of penn octane s existing debt  the rzb credit facility and the transmontaigne note  and therefore  both rio vista and penn octane may be unable to obtain additional financing collateralized by those assets 
penn octane s report of independent registered public accounting firm on the consolidated financial statements of penn octane at december  contains an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty about penn octane s ability to continue as a going concern 
if penn octane s and rio vista s cash flows are not adequate to pay their obligations  penn octane and or rio vista may be required to raise additional funds to avoid foreclosure by penn octane s creditors 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to either penn octane or rio vista or available at all 
if additional amounts cannot be raised and cash flow is inadequate  penn octane and or rio vista would likely be required to seek other alternatives which could include the sale of assets  closure of operations and or protection under the us bankruptcy laws 

table of contents guarantees and assets pledged on certain of penn octane s obligations 
rio vista has agreed to guarantee certain of penn octane s obligations to creditors and all of rio vista s assets are pledged as collateral for those obligations of penn octane to such creditors 
in addition  rio vista has agreed to indemnify penn octane for a period of three years from the fiscal year end that includes the date of the spin off for any federal income tax liabilities resulting from the spin off in excess of million 
penn octane has filed its federal income tax return for the year of the spin off and it did not incur a federal income tax liability in excess of million 
however  the internal revenue service the irs may review penn octane s federal income tax returns and challenge positions that penn octane has taken with respect to the spin off 
further  if penn octane is determined to have a federal income tax liability in excess of the amounts which were included in the federal income tax return related to the spin off and if penn octane is unable to pay such liabilities or rio vista is unable to pay  then the internal revenue service may assert that the penn octane stockholders who received common units in the spin off are liable for unpaid federal income taxes of penn octane  including interest and any penalties  up to the value of the rio vista common units received by each stockholder 
as a result of the pledge of the collateral  rio vista may be unable to obtain financing using these pledged assets as collateral and rio vista s inability to borrow on these assets may adversely affect rio vista s results of operations and ability to make distributions to its unitholders 
rio vista may also be prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default  or if an event of default is existing  under penn octane s revolving credit facilities  or any other covenant which may exist under any other credit arrangement or other regulatory requirement at the time

in connection with rio vista s guaranty  rio vista granted rzb a security interest and assignment in any and all of rio vista s accounts  inventory  real property  buildings  pipelines  fixtures and interests therein or relating thereto  including  without limitation  the lease with the brownsville navigation district of cameron county the district for the land on which rio vista s brownsville terminal facility is located  and has entered into leasehold deeds of trust  security agreements  financing statements and assignments of rent 
under the rzb credit facility  rio vista may not permit to exist any subsequent lien  security interest  mortgage  charge or other encumbrance of any nature on any of its properties or assets  except in favor of rzb  without the consent of rzb 
in connection with the lpg supply agreement  penn octane and rio vista have agreed to share the financing costs related to penn octane s purchase of lpg under the rzb credit facility 

table of contents under the rzb credit facility  penn octane is required to pay a fee with respect to each letter of credit thereunder in an amount equal to the greater of i  ii of the maximum face amount of such letter of credit  or iii such higher amount as may be agreed to between penn octane and rzb

on july  in connection with the annual march  renewal of the rzb credit facility  rzb agreed to no longer require mr 
richter s personal guarantee and he no longer furnishes the guarantee 
under the terms of the rzb credit facility  all cash from rio vista s lpg sales are deposited directly into a restricted cash account under the direction of rzb to pay down all obligations of penn octane arising under the rzb credit facility 
accordingly  rio vista only receives net proceeds from the restricted cash account when the amounts of collateral provided by penn octane and rio vista exceed all liabilities under outstanding letters of credit issued on behalf of penn octane  at the sole discretion of rzb 
upon the release of rio vista s net proceeds from rio vista s restricted cash account  rio vista is then required to pay any remaining amounts due penn octane  if any  for the supply of lpg and other allocated or direct expenses 
lpg financing expense allocated to rio vista from penn octane associated with the rzb credit facility totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
penn octane may need to increase its credit facility for increases in quantities of lpg and fuel products purchased and or to finance future price increases of lpg and fuel products 
rio vista relies on penn octane s ability to allocate credit limits under the rzb credit facility to purchase quantities of lpg 
however there can be no assurance that penn octane will have available and or continue to provide sufficient credit limits for rio vista s required purchases of lpg

partnership tax treatment 
rio vista is not a taxable entity for us tax purposes see below and incurs no us federal income tax liability 
rio vista s mexican subsidiaries are taxed on their income directly by the mexican government 
the income loss of rio vista s mexican subsidiaries are included in the us partnership income tax return of rio vista 
the holders of the common units and general partner interest will be entitled to their proportionate share of any tax credits resulting from any income taxes paid to the mexican government 
each unitholder of rio vista is required to take into account that unitholder s share of items of income  gain  loss and deduction of rio vista in computing that unitholder s federal income tax liability  even if no cash distributions are made to the unitholder by rio vista 
distributions by rio vista to a unitholder are generally not taxable unless the amount of cash distributed is in excess of the unitholder s adjusted basis in rio vista 
section of the internal revenue code the code provides that publicly traded partnerships shall  as a general rule  be taxed as corporations despite the fact that they are not classified as corporations under section of the code 
section of the code provides an exception to this general rule for a publicly traded partnership if or more of its gross income for every taxable year consists of qualifying income the qualifying income exception 
for purposes of this exception  qualifying income includes income and gains derived from the exploration  development  mining or production  processing  refining  transportation including pipelines or marketing of any mineral or natural resource 
other types of qualifying income include interest other than from a financial business or interest based on profits of the borrower  dividends  real property rents  gains from the sale of real property  including real property held by one considered to be a dealer in such property  and gains from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income 
no ruling has been or will be sought from the irs and the irs has made no determination as to rio vista s classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or whether rio vista s operations generate a minimum of of qualifying income under section of the code 
if rio vista was classified as a corporation in any taxable year  either as a result of a failure to meet the qualifying income exception or otherwise  rio vista s items of income  gain  loss and deduction would be reflected only on rio vista s tax return rather than being passed through to rio vista s unitholders  and rio vista s net income would be taxed at corporate rates 
if rio vista was treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  rio vista would pay tax on income at corporate rates  which is currently a maximum of 
distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  or deductions would flow through to the unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon rio vista as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced and rio vista s ability to make minimum quarterly distributions would be impaired 
consequently  treatment of rio vista as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to unitholders and therefore would likely result in a substantial reduction in the value of rio vista s common units 

table of contents current law may change so as to cause rio vista to be taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject rio vista to entity level taxation 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects rio vista to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects rio vista to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amount will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on rio vista 
litigation 
penn octane  rio vista and or rio vista s subsidiaries have been named as defendants in two lawsuits filed in connection with an accident in the town of lucio blanco  mexico on august   involving a tanker truck carrying lpg which was struck by a train resulting in an explosion 
none of penn octane  rio vista nor any of rio vista s subsidiaries owned or operated the tanker truck or employed or controlled the driver of the tanker truck 
further  none of the penn octane  rio vista nor any of rio vista s subsidiaries owned or had custody of the lpg on the tanker truck at the time and location of the accident 
the tanker truck reportedly took delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility operated under agreement with rio vista s mexican subsidiaries 
according to the lawsuits  after leaving the matamoros terminal facility  the tanker truck was involved in a collision with a train in lucio blanco  mexico  resulting in a tragic explosion that killed and injured several persons and caused significant property damage 
published reports indicate that the truck used a road not approved for large trucks and failed to stop at an unprotected rail crossing  resulting in the collision and explosion 
the operator of the tanker truck  or its insurance company  is reportedly taking claims in mexico from victims of the accident 
even though the accident took place in mexico  both lawsuits were filed in texas 
the first case is captioned lesly camacho by her mother dora adame as next friend  et al 
vs 
penn octane international llc and was filed in the th district court for cameron county  texas on september  the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and a temporary injunction in order to preserve evidence relevant to the case and assets to secure a potential judgment 
an ex parte temporary restraining order was sought and obtained by the plaintiffs on september   in order to preserve evidence and prevent any sale of assets  including penn octane s and rio vista s lpg asset sales 
this order was issued without prior notice to  or opportunity to contest by  penn octane or rio vista 
the temporary restraining order expired in accordance with its terms on october  and no further injunctive relief has been granted 
on november   the parties entered into an agreement on the record wherein a subsidiary of rio vista assumed the obligation of preserving and delivering relevant evidence  and the plaintiffs dropped their request for a temporary injunction against a sale of assets 
limited discovery has been conducted to date 
the second case is captioned faustino izaguirre gonzalez  et al 
vs 
penn octane corporation  et al 
and was filed in the th district court for cameron county  texas  on november  the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages 
on december   penn octane  rio vista and rio vista s subsidiaries filed a motion for removal of the case in the us district court for the southern district of texas  brownsville division 
on february   the us district court denied a motion by the plaintiffs to remand the case to state court and dismissed the case as to defendants other than penn octane corporation 
the court found that the plaintiffs failed to provide factual allegations sufficient to establish a possibility of recovery against rio vista or its subsidiaries 
the plaintiffs have filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s rulings 
management believes the above lawsuits against penn octane  rio vista and or rio vista s subsidiaries are without merit and  based on the advice of counsel  does not anticipate either liability for damages or the issuance of a temporary injunction against a sale of penn octane s or rio vista s assets 
rio vista s insurance carrier is expected to bear the legal fees and expenses in connection with defending these cases 
if  however  a court found liability on the part of penn octane  rio vista or their subsidiaries  a judgment or settlement in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on penn octane s and rio vista s business  financial condition and results of operations

farms  inc  the special commissioners appointed by the district court of cameron county  texas awarded  to a land owner in connection with the acquisition of a right of way by rio vista 
the  was deposited into the registry of the court on november  rio vista is currently appealing the  award 
subsequently the land owner has filed an inverse condemnation action against both rio vista and penn octane seeking damages of million 
rio vista believes that the claim is not supported by the facts or existing law related to inverse condemnation and is without merit 
the company filed a partial summary judgment motion seeking a determination by the court that there are no compensable damages arising from an inverse condemnation 
the hearing on this motion has not been scheduled 
rio vista and its subsidiaries are involved with other proceedings  lawsuits and claims 
rio vista believes that the liabilities  if any  ultimately resulting from such proceedings  lawsuits and claims should not materially affects its consolidated financial results 
consulting agreement 
during november  penn octane  rio vista and mr 
richter entered into a consulting agreement whereby mr 
richter shall serve as a special advisor to the board of directors of penn octane and the board of managers of rio vista and will provide the following services the services to both penn octane and rio vista assistance with the sale of all or part of their lpg assets  assistance with other transactions including restructurings involving the companies as mutually agreed by the parties and such other services that the companies may reasonably request 
in consideration of the services rendered by mr 
richter to the companies  penn octane and rio vista agreed to pay the following fees the fees to mr 
richter an amount equal to two percent of i the net proceeds  as defined  to the companies resulting from a sale of assets to a third party  and ii the net proceeds  as defined  to the companies from sales of lpg to pmi for any calendar month in which such sales exceed the volumes pursuant to the pmi agreement see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
rio vista may  in its discretion  offset the amount of any fees due and payable to mr 
richter against any amounts owed whether or not then due or payable by mr 
richter to rio vista 
the term of this consulting agreement shall continue until the earlier of november  or termination of the agreement upon days written notice to the other party 
distributions of available cash 
all rio vista unitholders have the right to receive distributions from rio vista of available cash as defined in the partnership agreement in an amount equal at least to the minimum distribution of per quarter per unit  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the units from prior quarters 
the general partner has a right to receive a distribution corresponding to its general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights described below 
the distributions are to be paid days after the end of each calendar quarter 
however  rio vista is prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default  or an event of default exists  under any obligation of penn octane which rio vista has guaranteed 
in addition to its general partner interest  the general partner is currently the holder of incentive distribution rights which entitle the holder to an increasing portion of cash distributions as described in the partnership agreement 
as a result  cash distributions from rio vista are shared by the holders of the common units and the general partner interest based on a formula whereby the general partner receives disproportionately more distributions per percentage interest than the holders of the common units as annual cash distributions exceed certain milestones 
on both february  and may   rio vista made cash distributions of  for the quarters ended december  and march  because of insufficient available cash  rio vista has not declared a distribution for the quarters ended june   september  and december  
table of contents rio vista s ability to make distributions will continue to be impacted if sales to pmi are not at sufficient volumes and margins  payments are required on its guarantees  expenses increase  rio vista is unable to obtain additional financing on its pledged assets or the lpg asset sale does not close 
although penn octane is not required to do so  to the extent that penn octane has sufficient cash to do so  it may lend amounts to rio vista to meet the minimum distributions 
if rio vista s revenues and other sources of liquidity after its quarterly distributions are not adequate to satisfy such payment obligations of penn octane and or penn octane does not have the necessary cash to loan to rio vista  rio vista may be unable to resume the quarterly distributions to unitholders  and penn octane and or rio vista may be required to raise additional funds to avoid foreclosure 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to either penn octane or rio vista or available at all 
there can be no assurance that the lpg asset sale will be completed according to the terms contained in the psa s or according to different terms or at all 
even if the lpg asset sale is completed  rio vista may be unable to resume payment of minimum quarterly distributions or to pay the arrearages of such distributions  in order to maintain cash reserves necessary for the conduct of business 
a continued delay of or inability to close the lpg asset sale could have a material adverse effect on penn octane s and rio vista s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a reconciliation of rio vista s consolidated net income to distributable cash flow for the three months ended march   june   september  and december  three months ended march  june  september  december  net income loss plus interest and lpg financing expense and taxes  net plus depreciation and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda plus other non cash expenses less cash interest  lpg financing expense and taxes  net distributable cash flow deficit distributable cash flow deficit applicable to general partner distributable cash flow deficit applicable to limited partners rio vista utilizes two financial measures  ebitda and distributable cash flow  which are not defined in gaap 
management uses these financial measures because they are widely accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare partnership performance 
in addition  management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of rio vista s assets and the cash flow the business is generating 
neither ebitda nor distributable cash flow are intended to represent cash flows for the period  nor are they presented as an alternative to net income 
they should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents sales to pmi 
pmi and rio vista operated under a three month contract for the period from january  to march  and monthly contracts for april and may effective june   rio vista entered into an agreement with pmi for the period june  through march  for the sale of lpg to pmi the pmi agreement 
the minimum contract volumes and actual volumes sold and margins for the year ended december  were materially lower than historical levels 
the following table sets forth the minimum monthly volume of lpg that pmi has committed to purchase from rio vista pursuant to the pmi agreement and the actual volumes purchased for the months june through march month minimum contract volumes actual volumes sold gallons gallons june july august september october november december january february march the pmi agreement has expired 
rio vista has yet to sign an extension and or renewal of the lpg contract with pmi 
there is no assurance that the lpg contract with pmi will be extended and or renewed  and if so  that the terms will be more or less favorable than those of the pmi agreement 
until the terms of a new long term contract are reached  rio vista expects to enter into additional monthly agreements with terms similar to the pmi agreement 
rio vista s management believes that pmi s reduction of volume commitments and margins for april through march is based on additional lpg production by pemex being generated from the burgos basin field in reynosa  mexico  an area within the proximity of rio vista s matamoros terminal facility and increased competition from us suppliers 
in the event the volume of lpg purchased by pmi under future month to month agreements declines below the current volume levels  assuming margins remain unchanged  rio vista may suffer material adverse consequences to its business  financial condition and results of operations to the extent that penn octane is unable to obtain additional favorable price reductions in connection with its lpg supply agreement 
in connection with the lpg supply agreement  penn octane may continue to seek further price concessions from lpg suppliers 
if penn octane is unsuccessful in lowering its lpg costs and current volumes decline and or rio vista is forced to accept similar or lower prices for sales to pmi  the results of operations of rio vista may be adversely affected 
rio vista may not have sufficient cash flow or available credit to absorb such reductions in gross profit 
pmi has primarily used the matamoros terminal facility to load lpg purchased from penn octane prior to the spin off and from rio vista  subsequent thereto  for distribution by truck in mexico 
rio vista continues to use the brownsville terminal facility in connection with lpg delivered by railcar to other customers  storage and as an alternative terminal in the event the matamoros terminal facility cannot be used 
seasonality 
rio vista s gross profit will be dependent on sales volume of lpg to pmi  which fluctuates in part based on the seasons 
the demand for lpg is strongest during the winter season and weakest during the summer season 

table of contents lpg supply agreement 
penn octane entered into the lpg supply agreement with rio vista pursuant to which rio vista has agreed to purchase all of its lpg requirements for sales which utilize the assets transferred to rio vista by penn octane to the extent penn octane is able to supply such lpg requirements 
the lpg supply agreement further provides that rio vista has no obligation to purchase lpg from penn octane to the extent the distribution of such lpg to rio vista s customers would not require the use of any of the assets penn octane transferred to rio vista or penn octane ceases to have the right to access the leased pipeline 
under the lpg supply agreement  penn octane supplies all of rio vista s lpg requirements in connection with its lpg sales obligations to pmi 
the purchases of the lpg are at fluctuating prices and are determined based on the cost of lpg under penn octane s agreements with its lpg suppliers for volumes sold to rio vista for sale to pmi or to other rio vista customers  other direct costs related to pmi and other lpg sales of rio vista and a formula that takes into consideration operating costs of penn octane and rio vista 
rio vista expects the aggregate costs per gallon to purchase lpg less any applicable adjustments to be below the aggregate sales prices per gallon of lpg sold to pmi 
rio vista believes that its lpg supply agreement with penn octane provides it with an advantage over competitors in the supply of lpg to pmi based on penn octane s adequate volumes and price provided for in its agreements with its lpg suppliers  and penn octane s leased pipeline which takes the lpg directly to rio vista s brownsville terminal facility from those suppliers 
the leased pipeline s capacity is estimated to be between million and million gallons per month 
under the terms of penn octane s existing supply contract  penn octane must provide letters of credit in amounts equal to the cost of the product to be purchased 
in addition  the cost of the product purchased is tied directly to overall market conditions 
as a result  penn octane s existing letter of credit facility may not be adequate to meet the letter of credit requirements under agreement with its supplier due to increases in quantities of lpg purchased and or to finance future price increases of lpg 
the lpg supply agreement terminates on the earlier to occur of penn octane ceases to have the right to access the leased pipeline that connects to rio vista s brownsville terminal facility  or rio vista ceases to sell lpg using any of the assets transferred by penn octane to rio vista pursuant to the spin off 
mexican operations 
under current mexican law  foreign ownership of mexican entities involved in the distribution of lpg or the operation of lpg terminal facilities is prohibited 
foreign ownership is permitted in the transportation and storage of lpg 
mexican law also provides that a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage or distribution 
pennmex has a transportation permit and termatsal owns  leases  or is in the process of obtaining the land or rights of way used in the construction of the mexican portion of the us mexico pipelines  and owns the mexican portion of the assets comprising the us mexico pipelines and the matamoros terminal facility 
rio vista s consolidated mexican affiliate  tergas  has been granted the permit to operate the matamoros terminal facility and rio vista relies on tergas permit to continue its delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility 
tergas is owned by mr 
vicente soriano  and the remaining balance is owned by mr 
abelardo mier 
rio vista has an option to purchase tergas for a nominal price of approximately  through its operations in mexico and the operations of the mexican subsidiaries and tergas  rio vista subject to the tax laws of mexico which  among other things  require that rio vista comply with transfer pricing rules  the payment of income  asset and ad valorem taxes  and possibly taxes on distributions in excess of earnings 
in addition  distributions to foreign corporations  including dividends and interest payments may be subject to mexican withholding taxes 
during december  termatsal sold to tergas all of its matamoros terminal facility related assets  including land  for million 
the terminal related assets were paid for through the issuance of a note from tergas to termatsal 

table of contents deregulation of the lpg industry in mexico 
the mexican petroleum industry is governed by the ley reglarmentaria del art culo constitutional en el ramo del petr leo the regulatory law to article of the constitution of mexico concerning petroleum affairs the regulatory law  reglamento de gas licuado de petroleo regulation of lpg and ley org nica del petr leos mexicanos y organismos subsidiarios the organic law of petr leos mexicanos and subsidiary entities the organic law 
under mexican law and related regulations  pemex is entrusted with the central planning and the strategic management of mexico s petroleum industry  including importation  sales and transportation of lpg 
in carrying out this role  pemex controls pricing and distribution of various petrochemical products  including lpg 
beginning in  as part of a national privatization program  the regulatory law was amended to permit private entities to transport  store and distribute natural gas with the approval of the ministry of energy 
as part of this national privatization program  the mexican government is expected to deregulate the lpg market deregulation 
in june  the regulation of lpg was enacted to permit foreign entities to participate without limitation in the defined lpg activities related to transportation and storage 
however  foreign entities are prohibited from participating in the distribution of lpg in mexico 
upon deregulation  mexican entities will be able to import lpg into mexico 
under mexican law  an entity with a permit to transport lpg is not permitted to obtain permits for the other defined lpg activities storage and distribution 
rio vista expects to sell lpg directly to independent mexican distributors as well as pmi upon deregulation 
rio vista anticipates that the independent mexican distributors will be required to obtain authorization from the mexican government for the importation of lpg upon deregulation prior to entering into contracts with rio vista 
during july  the mexican government announced that it would begin to accept applications from mexican companies for permits to allow for the importation of lpg pursuant to provisions already provided for under existing mexican law 
in connection with the above  in august  tergas received a one year permit from the mexican government to import lpg 
during september  the mexican government decided to delay the implementation of deregulation and asked tergas to defer use of the permit and as a result  penn octane did not sell lpg to distributors other than pmi 
in march  the mexican government again announced its intention to issue permits for free importation of lpg into mexico by distributors and others beginning august  which was again delayed 
to date the mexican government has continued to delay implementation of deregulation 
tergas permit to import lpg expired during august tergas intends to obtain a new permit when the mexican government again begins to accept applications 
as a result of the foregoing  it is uncertain as to when  if ever  deregulation will actually occur and the effect  if any  it will have on rio vista 
however  should deregulation occur  it is rio vista s intention to sell lpg directly to distributors in mexico as well as to pmi 
the point of sale for lpg which flows through the us mexico pipelines for delivery to the matamoros terminal facility is the united states mexico border 
for lpg delivered into mexico  pmi is the importer of record

table of contents the omnibus agreement may be amended by written agreement of the parties  provided  however that it may not be amended without the approval of the conflicts committee of the general partner if such amendment would adversely affect the unitholders of rio vista 
the omnibus agreement has an initial term of five years that automatically renews for successive five year terms and  other than the indemnification provisions  will terminate if rio vista is no longer an affiliate of penn octane 
realization of assets 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet has been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which contemplate continuation of rio vista as a going concern 
rio vista has a loss from operations for the year ended december  and has a deficit in working capital 
rio vista is dependent on penn octane s ability to deliver adequate quantities of lpg at an acceptable price for ultimate sale to pmi  to provide credit to rio vista for such purchases and to provide management of its operations 
currently  rio vista s only source of revenue is from sales of lpg to pmi and it operates under a short term sale agreement with pmi which provides for monthly volumes which are materially less than penn octane s historical monthly volumes and margins 
as a result  penn octane s and rio vista s gross profit have been materially reduced and may continue to decline and their cash flow and available credit may be insufficient to absorb such additional reductions in gross profit 
the lpg asset sale has not closed and the transmontaigne note may be due on the earlier of the time of closing or days following demand by transmontaigne see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the pmi agreement expired on march  and has not yet been renewed or extended 
rio vista expects its gross profit from operations for the period january  through march   based on the minimum volumes and the margins provided for in the pmi agreement  to provide sufficient cash flow for rio vista to pay its normal operating expenses through march  however  cash flow may not be sufficient to allow rio vista to pay the transmontaigne note  to pay costs of maintenance and repairs and professional fees related to the lpg asset sale and or to pay arrearages in distributions or make future distributions to rio vista s unitholders 
subsequent to march   rio vista s gross profits on sales may be insufficient to pay its operating expenses if i the lpg asset sale has not closed ii rio vista cannot sell lpg to pmi or other customers at adequate margins and volumes and or iii rio vista cannot sufficiently reduce its other expenses 
rio vista has guaranteed certain of penn octane s obligations 
substantially all of rio vista s and penn octane s assets are pledged or committed to be pledged as collateral on million of penn octane s existing debt  the rzb credit facility and the transmontaigne note  and therefore  both rio vista and penn octane may be unable to obtain additional financing collateralized by those assets 
penn octane s report of independent registered public accounting firm on the consolidated financial statements of penn octane at december  contains an explanatory paragraph which describes an uncertainty about penn octane s ability to continue as a going concern 
if penn octane s and rio vista s cash flows are not adequate to pay their obligations  penn octane and or rio vista may be required to raise additional funds to avoid foreclosure by penn octane s creditors 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to either penn octane or rio vista or available at all 
if additional amounts cannot be raised and cash flow is inadequate  penn octane and or rio vista would likely be required to seek other alternatives which could include the sale of assets  closure of operations and or protection under the us bankruptcy laws 
in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs  recoverability of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon closing the lpg asset sale  or if the lpg asset sales does not close  upon the ability of penn octane to continue as a going concern and the continued sale of lpg to pmi at adequate volumes and margins to provide sufficient cash flow to pay rio vista s expenses  the transmontaigne note and guarantees of penn octane s obligations assuming penn octane s inability to pay such obligations 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should rio vista be unable to continue in existence 
to provide rio vista with the ability it believes necessary to continue in existence  management is taking steps to close the lpg asset sale 
since the lpg asset sale has not closed  management has continued to negotiate with pmi for the continued sale of lpg at adequate volumes and margins 
in the event the lpg asset sale is not closed  management may also continue to attempt to sell its lpg assets 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation in the united states and mexico has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of rio vista 
however  inflation remains a factor in the united states and mexican economies and could increase rio vista s cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment as well as our labor and supply costs 
rio vista may be adversely impacted as a result of increases in lpg prices  which are related to oil and natural gas prices  because of limits on penn octane s credit facility 
environmental matters rio vista s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
under the omnibus agreement  penn octane will indemnify rio vista for five years after the completion of the spin off against certain potential environmental liabilities associated with the assets it contributed to rio vista relating to events or conditions that existed before the completion of the spin off

see note b to those consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
rio vista believes that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that affect the financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition rio vista expects in the future to enter into sales agreements to sell lpg for future delivery 
rio vista will not record sales until the lpg is delivered to the customer 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to assets in future periods

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to the extent that rio vista maintains quantities of lpg inventory in excess of commitments for quantities of undelivered lpg and or has commitments for undelivered lpg in excess of inventory balances  rio vista is exposed to market risk related to the volatility of lpg prices 
in the event that inventory balances exceed commitments for undelivered lpg  during periods of falling lpg prices  rio vista may sell excess inventory to customers to reduce the risk of these price fluctuations
