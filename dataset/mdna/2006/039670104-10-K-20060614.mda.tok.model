critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue and provides for estimated marketing and sales incentive costs when products are shipped to dealers and distributors pursuant to their order  the price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
arctic cat has agreements with finance companies to repurchase products repossessed up to certain limits 
arctic cat s financial exposure to repurchase products is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company and the resale value of the repossessed products 
historically  arctic cat has not incurred material losses as a result of repurchases nor has it provided a financial reserve for repurchases 
adverse changes in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
marketing and sales incentive costs the company provides for various marketing and sales incentive costs which are offered to its dealers and consumers at the later of when the revenue is recognized or when the marketing and sales incentive program is approved and communicated 
examples of these costs include dealer and consumer rebates  dealer floorplan financing assistance and other incentive and promotion programs 
adverse market conditions resulting in lower than expected retail sales or the matching of competitor programs could cause accrued marketing and incentive costs to materially increase if the company authorizes and communicates new programs to its dealers 
the company estimates marketing and sales incentive costs based on expected usage and historical experience 
the related marketing and sales incentive costs accrual is included in accrued marketing in the company s balance sheet 
to the extent current experience differs with previous estimates the accrued liability for marketing and sales incentives is adjusted accordingly 
product warranties the company generally provides a limited warranty to the owner of snowmobiles for twelve months from the date of consumer registration and for six months on atvs 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical rates and trends and makes subsequent adjustments to their estimate as actual claims become known or the amounts are determinable 
adverse changes in actual warranty costs compared to the company s initial estimates could cause accrued warranty to materially change 
product liability and litigation the company is subject to product liability claims and other litigation in the normal course of business 
arctic cat insures for product liability claims although it retains a modest self insured retention accrual within the balance sheet caption insurance 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses over insured amounts are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate loss 
adverse changes in the final determination of product liability or other claims made against the company could have a material impact on the company s financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of the company s snowmobile production cycle and the lead time between the commencement of snowmobile and atv production in the early spring and commencement of shipments late in the first quarter have resulted in significant fluctuations in the company s working capital requirements during the year 
historically  the company has financed its working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short term bank borrowings during the middle of the cycle 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations together with its available line of credit will provide sufficient funds to finance the company on a short and long term basis 
cash and short term investments cash and short term investments were  at march  compared to  at march  the company s cash balances traditionally peak early in the fourth quarter and then decrease as working capital requirements increase when the company s snowmobile and spring atv production cycles begin

the company has agreements with certain finance companies to provide snowmobile and atv floor plan financing for the company s north american dealers

the company is paid by the floor plan companies shortly after shipment and as part of its marketing programs the company pays the floor plan financing of its dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer s order 
the financing agreements require repurchase of repossessed new and unused units and set limits upon the company s potential liability for annual repurchases 
the aggregate potential liability was approximately  at march  the company has incurred no material losses under these agreements 
the company believes current available cash and cash generated from operations provide sufficient funding in the event there is a requirement to perform under this guarantee and repurchase agreement 
in  the company invested  in capital expenditures

since  the company has repurchased over million shares of common stock 
there is approximately million remaining on the may repurchase authorization

the majority of these purchases were made from suzuki motor corporation who supplies engines for the company s snowmobiles and atvs
