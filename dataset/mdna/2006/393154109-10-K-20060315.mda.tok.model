item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md and a executive overview green mountain power corporation the company generates most of its earnings from retail electricity sales 
our retail electricity sales have grown at an average annual rate of between one and two percent  about average for most electric utility companies in new england 
in periods of very high energy prices  wholesale revenues and expenses arising primarily from sales and purchases to accommodate volumetric difference between energy supplies and customer demand can affect earnings to a significant degree 
the company is regulated and cannot adjust prices of retail electricity sales without regulatory approval from the vermont public service board vpsb 
the company increased its common stock dividend in february from an annual rate of per share to per share 
the company s dividend payout ratio during was comparatively low  at approximately percent of earnings from continuing operations 
we expect to grow our dividend payout ratio to the middle of a payout range of between and percent over the next five years  in line with other electric utilities having similar risk profiles  so long as financial and operating results permit 
fair regulatory treatment is fundamental to maintaining the company s financial stability 
rates must be set at levels to recover costs  including a market rate of return to equity and debt holders in order to attract capital 
the company s allowed rate of return on its regulated operations is currently capped at percent  reduced by amounts normally excluded for purposes of setting rates and is determined by the vpsb 
nearly all of the company s continuing operations are treated for ratemaking purposes as regulated operations 
the company s return on equity was percent reflecting the exclusions mentioned above 
these exclusions also make it unlikely that the company s operating results will achieve its allowed rate of return while its earnings are subject to the earnings cap 
the company is currently operating under a three year rate plan approved by the vpsb in december the rate plan 
the rate plan covers the period and has provided the company with a stable  predictable rate path through  a plan for full recovery of the company s principal regulatory assets  and an improved opportunity to earn a fair rate of return 
the rate plan is described in more detail below under rates 
power supply expenses were equivalent to approximately percent of total operating expenses in therefore  any significant increase in the cost of our power supply resources would likely require the company to seek a rate increase 
the company expects to file a retail rate case requesting a rate increase estimated at between ten and fifteen percent in  effective for january   partially as a result of the need to replace an expiring power supply contract 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts for most of our energy needs 
all of our power supply contract costs are currently included in the rates we charge our customers 
the risks associated with our power supply resources  including outage  curtailment  and other delivery risks  the timing of contract expirations  the volatility of wholesale prices  and other factors impacting our power supply resources and how they relate to customer demand are discussed below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
we also discuss other risks  including customer concentration risk related to our largest customer  international business machines corporation ibm  and contingencies that could have a significant impact on future operating results and our financial condition 
growth opportunities beyond the company s normal investment in its infrastructure are also discussed  and include a planned increase in our equity investment in vermont electric power company  inc velco and an opportunity for increased sales of utility services 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affect our overall financial condition 
from time to time in this report  we may make statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on our then current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward looking statements 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation and other regulatory risks energy supply and demand  outages and other power supply volume risks power supply price risks customer concentration risks pension and postretirement health care risks customer service quality changes in regional market and transmission rules contractual commitments credit risks  including availability  terms  and use of capital and counterparty credit quality general economic and business environment changes in technology nuclear and environmental issues alternative regulation and cost recovery including stranded costs weather additional risk factors that may cause such a difference are discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and elsewhere herein and are incorporated herein 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary for the years ended consolidated diluted earnings per share of common stock consolidated diluted earnings per share of common stock continuing operations consolidated return on average common equity earnings from continuing operations in were essentially unchanged compared with increases in retail operating revenues during exceeded increases in power supply expenses 
retail operating revenues improved in because of a percent rate increase that took effect at the beginning of  increased sales of electricity to customers  and an increase in the number of customers we serve 
other operating expenses  maintenance expenses  depreciation and amortization  and transmission expenses also increased during compared with  offsetting the increase in margins on the sale of electricity 
retail operating revenues for increased by million compared with the same period in  reflecting the effects of a percent retail rate increase  warmer summer weather  an increase in the number of company customers  and increased sales of utility services to other utilities and large industrial and commercial customers 
these increases were partially offset by recognition in of million in revenue deferred under our rate plan 
under the company s rate plan  approved by the vpsb in december  rates remained unchanged in and the company put into effect retail rate increases of percent generating approximately million in added annual revenues in january and percent generating approximately million in added annual revenues in january the rate plan also allowed the company to carry unused deferred revenue totaling approximately million to and to recognize this revenue to help to achieve its allowed rate of return during total retail megawatt hour sales of electricity increased by percent in  compared with the same period in sales to residential and small commercial and industrial customers increased by percent and percent  respectively  while sales to large commercial and industrial customers increased by percent in revenues from the sale of utility services to other utilities and large industrial and commercial customers increased by approximately million in  compared with the prior year 
wholesale revenues in also increased by million compared with  reflecting substantially higher wholesale energy prices in other operating expenses increased by million in  reflecting an increase of million in utility services expense 
the company s utility services business is designed to recover some of its administrative and staffing costs from other parties  ultimately reducing costs to customers and improving financial results between rate cases 
power supply expenses increased million in compared with due to increased costs of market purchases to serve marginal load  increased purchases of power under the contract with hydro quebec  an increase in the cost of power under the power supply contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc the morgan stanley contract  and increased costs of transmission line losses and congestion charges allocated within the new england power pool by iso new england iso ne  the regional system operator 
congestion charges represent the cost of delivering energy to customers and reflect energy prices  customer demand  and the demands on transmission and generation resources 
the company paid an average market price of approximately per megawatt hour for system purchases during hours when customer demand exceeded supply during  compared to per megawatt hour in the same period last year  inclusive of the effects of congestion and line losses 
our cost of market purchases in rose approximately million accordingly 
increased hydro production and deliveries under long term power supply contracts with hydro quebec and vermont yankee had a significant dampening effect on the increase in power supply expenses the company experienced in maintenance expenses  depreciation and amortization  and transmission expenses also increased during compared with maintenance expenses increased by million  reflecting an increase in transmission and distribution line maintenance and maintenance of our gas turbines 
depreciation and amortization were million higher than in the previous year  reflecting increased plant investments and a  increase in amortization of regulatory assets 
transmission expenses increased by  during  compared with the prior year  as a result of an increase in charges allocated for system support in new england by iso ne  increased retail sales of energy and an increase in investments by vermont electric power company velco  the entity that owns and operates most of the transmission grid in vermont 
the company owns approximately percent of velco 
earnings from discontinued operations totaled 
per share in compared with 
per share in the prior year  reflecting diminished exposure to outstanding litigation against an inactive northern water resources nwr subsidiary that led to reversal of previously recorded reserves in the company accounts for its wholly owned subsidiary  nwr  as a discontinued operation 
nwr s assets and liabilities consist primarily of deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to a number of investments that the company has discontinued  deactivated  sold in part or retained as passive minority interests 
remaining holdings include a minority equity investment in a wind project that usually  but not always  generates tax losses  minority interest in a manufacturer of waste treatment equipment  and some non performing loans 
all of these investments have been written off except for associated deferred tax amounts  net of applicable valuation allowances 
earnings from continuing operations improved in primarily as a result of increased recognition of revenues previously deferred under a vpsb order described below  and from growth in retail sales of electricity to large and small commercial and industrial customers 
higher transmission expenses partially offset these benefits 
the vpsb s january rate order the settlement order allowed the company to defer revenues of approximately million  generated by leveling winter summer rates during  to help offset costs and realize our allowed rate of return during the period 
the rate plan permitted us to continue to defer and recognize these revenues in we recognized approximately million of these deferred revenues to achieve our allowed rate of return during  compared with approximately and million recognized in and  respectively 
at december   there were no remaining revenues deferred under the rate plan 
retail operating revenues in increased by million or percent compared with  reflecting an improving economy  including a modest growth in the number of customers served  and increased recognition of revenues deferred under the rate plan discussed above 
total retail megawatt hour sales of electricity increased by percent in  compared with the same period in megawatt hour sales of electricity to large and small commercial and industrial customers increased by percent and percent  respectively  while sales to residential customers were flat when compared with  reflecting milder and more normal weather conditions in wholesale revenues in decreased by million compared with  reflecting reduced sales of electricity under the morgan stanley contract  an agreement designed to manage price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
the reduction in wholesale revenues did not adversely affect company earnings in or and is not expected to adversely affect future operating results 
power supply expenses in decreased million compared with due to decreased wholesale sales of electricity  principally those associated with the morgan stanley contract 
power supply expense also decreased due to reduced expenses to supply an option agreement with hydro quebec the agreement  and an increase in credits resulting from monthly financial transmission rights ftr auctions conducted by iso ne designed to make regions with inadequate transmission and generation pay a premium for energy delivery 
earnings from discontinued operations totaled 
per share in compared with 
per share in the prior year  reflecting diminished exposure to outstanding litigation against an inactive nwr subsidiary that led to reversal of previously recorded reserves 
critical accounting policies we believe our most critical accounting policies include the timing of expense and revenue recognition under the regulatory accounting framework within which we operate  the manner in which we account for certain power supply contracts that qualify as derivatives  revenue recognition  particularly as it relates to unbilled and deferred revenues  the assumptions that we make regarding our defined benefit pension and postretirement health care plans  and management judgments about the expected outcome of litigation for contingencies 
these accounting policies  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
regulatory accounting the accompanying consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to rate regulated enterprises in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain types of regulation 
under sfas  the company accounts for certain transactions in accordance with permitted regulatory treatment 
as such  regulators may permit incurred costs or benefits  typically treated as expenses or income by unregulated entities  to be deferred and expensed or benefited in future periods 
costs are deferred as regulatory assets when the company concludes that future revenue will be provided to permit recovery of the previously incurred cost 
revenue may also be deferred as regulatory liabilities that would be returned to customers by reducing future revenue requirements 
the company analyzes evidence supporting deferral  including provisions for recovery in regulatory orders  past regulatory precedent  other regulatory correspondence and legal representations 
management s conclusions on the recovery of regulatory assets represent a critical accounting estimate 
conditions that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to recover specific costs  and a change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to some other form of regulation 
in the event that the company no longer satisfies the criteria under sfas  the company would be required to write off its regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities as set forth in the table below regulatory assets and liabilities at december  regulatory assets in thousands demand side management programs purchased power costs pine street barge canal power supply regulatory assets other regulatory assets total regulatory assets regulatory liabilities accumulated cost of removal power supply regulatory liability other regulatory liabilities total regulatory liabilities regulatory assets net of regulatory liabilities substantially all regulatory assets are being recovered in current rates effective january  and  with the exception of pine street barge canal and certain power contract related costs  include an associated return on investment 
the rate plan  approved by the vpsb in december  provides for amortization and recovery of nearly all of the regulatory assets listed above  beginning january  the pine street barge canal regulatory asset is subject to amortization over a period of years without a return on the remaining balance of the asset 
recovery of regulatory assets under the rate plan has eliminated much uncertainty regarding the valuation of these assets 
derivatives the power supply regulatory assets and liabilities represent the value of certain power supply contracts that must be marked to fair value as derivatives under current accounting rules 
the fair value of derivative power supply positions can vary significantly based on assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  price volatility for the power supply contracts and expected average forward market prices 
the company records contract specified prices for electricity as expense in the period used  as opposed to fair market values reflected in the above table  in accordance with accounting required by a vpsb order 
the power supply contract expenses are fully recovered in the rates we charge  and are discussed in more detail under power supply derivatives 
revenue recognition our operating revenues are derived principally from retail sales of electricity at regulated rates 
revenue is recognized when electricity is delivered 
the company accrues utility revenues  based on estimates of electric service rendered and not billed at the end of an accounting period and net of estimates of electricity lost line losses during transmission and distribution 
the company estimates its range of line losses at between percent and percent 
the company estimates that a substantial change of percent eg  from percent to percent in its line loss rate used for calculating its unbilled revenues would result in a pre tax change of approximately  the company s earnings are capped at its allowed rate of return on equity of percent 
at year end  the company estimates its earnings based on its rate model 
costs that are not allowed for rate setting purposes reduce our earnings and ability to achieve our allowed rate of return on equity for our operations as a whole 
we estimate the annual adverse effect of the earnings cap calculation on earnings at between zero and cents per share 
during  the company deferred million of revenue pre tax as required by the earnings cap calculation 
our earnings cap calculation is reviewed by the vpsb and is subject to change 
defined benefit plans the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement health care plans costs can vary significantly based on plan assumptions and results  including the following factors interest rates  healthcare cost trends  return on assets and compensation cost trends 
see note g in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sensitivities around certain defined benefit plan assumptions 
our funding level for our defined benefit plans has recently amounted to approximately percent of our projected obligation  about average for the industry 
contingencies management also exercises judgments about the expected outcome of litigation for contingencies 
if the company determines that it is probable that it will sustain a loss associated with pending litigation  regulatory proceedings or tax matters  and if it can estimate the likely amount of such loss  it will record a liability for that amount 
our critical accounting policies are discussed further below under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  under liquidity and capital resources pension  in note a  significant accounting policies  in note g  pension and retirement plans and in note h  commitments and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider our principal risks to include power supply risks  our regulatory environment particularly as it relates to the company s periodic need for rate relief  risks associated with our principal customer  ibm  benefit plan cost sensitivity to interest rates and healthcare cost inflation  and weather 
discussion of these and other risks  as well as factors contributing to mitigation of these risks  follows 
power supply risks 
power contract commitments the company meets more than percent of its customer demand through a series of long term physical and financial contracts 
the company s most significant power supply contracts are the hydro quebec vermont joint owners vjo contract the vjo contract and the vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vynpc contract the vynpc contract  which together cover approximately percent of our retail load 
the company has also entered into a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc the morgan stanley contract designed to manage wholesale electricity price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
the morgan stanley contract supplies approximately an additional percent of our load and expires december  the vjo and vynpc contracts are summarized in the following table 
the morgan stanley contract terms are subject to a confidentiality agreement 
contract mwh mwh mwh mwh mwh mwh expires vjo contract vynpc contract the company s current purchases under the vjo contract with hydro quebec are as follows schedule b megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy for twenty years beginning in september  and schedule c megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy at any time for years  beginning in november in  the company entered into an agreement with hydro quebec the agreement under which hydro quebec paid million to the company in and we provided hydro quebec options for the purchase of power in specified maximum amounts through  as discussed below under power supply derivatives 
on july   vynpc completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to entergy nuclear vermont yankee llc envy 
as part of the sale transaction  vynpc entered into a power purchase agreement ppa with envy under which envy is obligated to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of our energy requirements 
prices under the ppa generally range from to per mwh 
the ppa contains a provision known as the low market adjuster  which calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning in november if market prices rise  however  ppa prices are not adjusted upward in excess of the contract price 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the envy plant 
current market prices are far above these levels so we do not expect the low market adjuster to affect contract pricing in the near future 
we no longer bear the operating costs and risks associated with running and decommissioning the plant 
the company entered into the morgan stanley contract in in august  the morgan stanley contract was modified and extended to december  the morgan stanley contract price is substantially below current market prices 
under the morgan stanley contract  on a daily basis  and at morgan stanley s discretion  we sell power to morgan stanley from part of our portfolio of power resources at pre defined operating and pricing parameters 
morgan stanley sells to the company  at a pre defined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
we remain responsible for resource performance and availability 
the morgan stanley contract provides no coverage against major unscheduled power supply outages 
beginning january   the company reduced the power that it sells pursuant to the morgan stanley contract 
the output of some of our power supply resources  including purchases pursuant to our hydro quebec and vynpc contracts  which were sold to morgan stanley through  are no longer included in the morgan stanley contract 
this reduction in sales to morgan stanley reduced wholesale revenues by approximately million during when compared with  and correspondingly reduced power supply expense by a similar amount 
this change did not adversely affect the company s operating results or its opportunity to earn a fair rate of return during or power supply price risk the company meets most of its customer demand through a series of long term physical and financial contracts 
all of the company s power supply contract costs are currently being recovered through rates approved by the vpsb 
the company records the annual cost of power obtained under long term contracts as operating expenses 
there are occasions when the company s available supply of electricity is insufficient to meet customer demand 
during those periods  electricity is purchased at market prices 
the company must also purchase energy at market prices for outages or other delivery interruptions under its principal supply contracts 
we expect more than percent of our estimated load requirements through to be met by our contracts and generation and other power supply resources 
these contracts and resources significantly reduce the company s exposure to volatility in wholesale energy market prices 
a primary factor affecting future operating results is the volatility of the wholesale electricity market 
implementation of new england s wholesale market for electricity has increased volatility of wholesale power prices 
periods frequently occur when weather  availability of power supply resources and other factors cause significant differences between customer demand and electricity supply 
because electricity cannot be stored  in these situations the company must buy from or sell the difference into a marketplace that has experienced volatile energy prices 
market price trends also may make it more difficult to extend or enter into new power supply contracts at prices that avoid the need for rate relief 
vermont does not have an automatic fuel adjustment clause or similar mechanism to adjust rates for higher energy costs without prior regulatory approval 
the company is charged for a number of power supply ancillary services  including costs for congestion  reserves and regulation that vary in part due to changes in the price of energy 
congestion charges represent the cost of delivering energy to customers and reflect energy prices  customer demand  and the demands on transmission and generation resources 
the method of settling the cost of congestion and other ancillary services is administered by iso new england and is subject to change 
during periods of high prices  ancillary charges are volatile and can adversely impact earnings to a significant degree 
some energy that is purchased by the company and delivered over transmission and distribution lines is lost during the delivery process line losses 
all electric companies experience line losses  which vary according to the equipment employed  temperature and load demands 
the cost of line losses varies with the price of energy  which increased substantially during in periods of high price volatility  we estimate that our power supply expenses could vary in excess of million annually due to changes in line loss and congestion costs 
iso ne supports locational capacity payments licap to generators in an effort to differentiate the price generators receive for capacity at different locations within new england 
iso ne believes that proposed higher capacity payments in constrained areas will encourage the development of new generation where needed 
iso ne has petitioned ferc for approval of licap at levels that are expected to result in substantially higher capacity payments to generators beginning december  the changes have been disputed by numerous parties for a variety of reasons 
ferc has not yet approved iso ne s licap proposal 
in october  ferc initiated a settlement process to consider alternatives to the licap proposal 
under iso ne s current licap proposal  vermont is expected to fare better than many new england states since vermont has not restructured and many of its utilities  including the company  have specified power supply resources that meet their present needs 
therefore  requirements for capacity in vermont would largely consist of obtaining resources for incremental  as opposed to existing  load 
even incrementally  future licap amounts for load growth beyond could be material  and if so  would be expected to increase company rate requirements accordingly 
based on the current iso ne proposal  the company estimates that the impact of licap price increases would raise our power supply expenses by between  and  pre tax 
the company has established a risk management program designed to mitigate some of the potential adverse cash flow and income statement effects caused by power supply risks  including credit risks associated with counterparties 
transactions permitted by the risk management program include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  swaps and the sale or purchase of transmission congestion rights 
these transactions are used to hedge the risk of fossil fuel and spot market electricity price increases 
some of these transactions present the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in commodity prices 
our risk management policy specifies risk measures  the amount of tolerable risk exposure and authorization limits for transactions 
most of our principal power supply contract counter parties and generators  including hydro quebec and morgan stanley  currently have investment grade credit ratings 
envy does not have an investment grade rating 
power supply derivatives the morgan stanley contract is used to hedge our power supply costs against increases in fossil fuel prices 
the morgan stanley contract is a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
management has estimated the fair value of the future net benefit of this agreement at december  to be approximately million 
the company is unable to predict the price  contract duration or terms of any future power supply contract that could replace the morgan stanley contract after it expires on december  however  current market prices are substantially in excess of the morgan stanley contract  and we expect the replacement cost of this contract to increase substantially and to increase the company s need for rate relief in the company s agreement with hydro quebec grants hydro quebec an option to call power at prices that are now expected to be below estimated future wholesale market prices 
commencing april   and effective through the term of the vjo contract  which ends in  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis option a at the vjo contract energy price 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option a may not exceed  mwh  mwh in each contract year 
we expect hydro quebec to exercise option a each year 
over the same period  hydro quebec could exercise an option to purchase up to  mwh on an annual basis at the vjo contract energy price option b 
the cumulative amount of energy that could be purchased under option b could not exceed  mwh 
hydro quebec called its remaining entitlements of approximately  mwh under option b during hydro quebec exercised options a and b for  and  and the company purchased replacement power at a net cost of million  million and million  respectively 
the company has also covered option a during at a net cost of million 
hydro quebec s call for was made during the fourth quarter of for delivery during january and february  timed to take advantage of extremely high forward energy prices resulting from the effects of hurricanes katrina and wilma that interrupted gas production in the gulf of mexico 
energy prices in the northeast are heavily dependent upon natural gas prices 
in february  the company requested an accounting order from the vpsb allowing us to defer in extraordinary hurricane related costs  expected to be incurred in  of up to approximately million 
the vpsb granted our request in february that we expect to result in a regulatory asset of approximately million 
collectability of these amounts will be determined in our next retail rate filing  expected to be filed and decided in if the vpsb denies any or all of the amounts requested  these amounts would be charged against pre tax income immediately 
the agreement is a derivative and is effective through management s estimate of the fair value of the future net cost for this agreement at december  is approximately million 
we sometimes use forward contracts to hedge forecasted calls by hydro quebec under the agreement and treat such contracts as derivatives under sfas the company has other less significant derivative positions  including forward sales for the months of march may made to capture forward energy prices that were high by historical standards  and financial transmission rights ftrs that hedge against risks related to the cost of delivering energy from its generation point to where it is consumed 
the table below presents assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the morgan stanley contract  the agreement and forward sale contracts 
the forward prices for electricity used in this analysis are consistent with the company s current long term wholesale energy price forecast 
option value model risk free interest rate price volatility average forward price contract expires morgan stanley contract deterministic agreement black scholes forward sale contracts deterministic n a the table below presents the company s estimated market risk of the morgan stanley and hydro quebec derivatives and forward sale contract derivatives  estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in wholesale energy prices  which nets to million 
actual results may differ materially from the table illustration 
commodity price risk at december  fair value market risk in thousands morgan stanley contract agreement forward sale contracts under an accounting order issued by the vpsb  changes in the fair value of derivatives are deferred 
if a derivative instrument were terminated early because it is probable that a transaction or forecasted transaction will not occur  any gain or loss would be recognized in earnings immediately 
for derivatives held to maturity  the earnings impact is recorded in the period that the derivative is sold or matures 
other power supply risk under the vjo contract  hydro quebec has the right to reduce the load factor from percent to percent a total of three times over the life of the contract 
hydro quebec exercised the first of these load reduction options  effective for the year hydro quebec s exercise of this option increased power supply expense during by approximately million 
during  hydro quebec exercised its second option to reduce the load factor for  which increased power supply expense in by approximately million 
hydro quebec exercised its third and final option in to reduce deliveries occurring principally during  which increased power supply expense by an estimated million 
the vermont joint owners  including the company  retain two options to increase the load factor to percent from percent after  and the company exercised the first of these options in the fourth quarter of for delivery effective november  to october  hydro quebec also retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries under the vjo contract by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in quebec 
hydro quebec has not exercised this right and has not communicated to the company any present intention to do so 
we sometimes experience energy delivery deficiencies under the vjo contract as a result of outages or other problems with the transmission interconnection facilities over which we schedule deliveries 
when such deficiencies occur  we purchase replacement energy on the wholesale market  usually at prices that are substantially higher than vjo contract energy costs 
vjo energy prices are less than per megawatt hour  while forward prices in are in excess of per megawatt hour 
we expect to purchase in excess of  megawatt hours during  so any significant deficiencies in deliveries would increase power supply costs materially 
our vjo contract contains cross default provisions that allow hydro quebec to invoke step up provisions under which the other vermont utilities that are also parties to the contract would be required to purchase their proportionate share of the power supply entitlement of any defaulting utility 
the company is not aware of any instance where this provision has been invoked by hydro quebec 
in accordance with guidance set forth in fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  the company is required to disclose the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee 
such disclosure is required even if the likelihood of triggering the guarantee is remote 
in regards to the step up provision in the vjo contract  the company must assume that all other members of the vjo simultaneously default in order to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments 
the company believes this is a highly unlikely scenario given that the majority of vjo members are regulated utilities with regulated cost recovery 
each vjo participant has received regulatory approval to recover the cost of this purchased power 
despite the remote chance that such an event could occur  the company estimates that its undiscounted purchase obligation would be approximately million for the remainder of the contract  assuming that all other members of the vjo defaulted by january  and remained in default for the duration of the contract 
in such a scenario  the company would then own the power and could seek to resell the energy in the wholesale power markets and recovery the losses  if any  and or recover its costs from the defaulting members or its retail customers 
the range of outcomes full cost recovery  potential loss or potential profit would be highly dependent on vermont regulation and wholesale market prices at the time 
during  we estimate that the company paid an additional million for replacement power as the result of an unscheduled outage at the vermont yankee nuclear power plant 
during  another unscheduled outage resulted in the company s deferral of approximately  of added power supply costs 
while the vermont yankee plant has had an excellent operating record  future unscheduled outages could occur at times when replacement energy costs are well above vynpc contract costs 
based on current forward prices  we estimate that the company could potentially have to pay increased costs of approximately  for each day that the vermont yankee plant experienced an unscheduled outage 
historically  the vpsb has allowed the company to defer  rather than expense  the higher costs resulting from extraordinary outages at the plant 
since the company no longer owns an interest in the vermont yankee nuclear plant  we are not responsible for any fixed costs at the plant  the costs of decommissioning the plant  nor are we responsible for any plant repairs or maintenance costs during outages 
on june   a fire in the electrical conduits leading to a transformer outside the vermont yankee plant resulted in a shutdown of the plant 
the outage ended on july  in response to the company s request  the vpsb issued a final accounting order allowing the company to defer its incremental replacement power costs during the outage totaling approximately  the order also instructs the company to apply any proceeds received under a ratepayer protection plan rpp to reduce the balance of deferred replacement power costs 
the rpp was a part of envy s request to uprate or increase the output of the vermont yankee nuclear plant that was approved by the vpsb 
under the rpp  we have indemnification rights to between approximately  and million to recover uprate related reductions in output for the three year period beginning in may and ending after completion of the uprate or a maximum of three years  depending on future wholesale energy market prices 
envy disputes that the fire was uprate related 
the company has petitioned the vpsb to resolve the dispute 
the vermont yankee plant received final approval for uprating from the nuclear regulatory commission on march  the plant production will now be gradually increased and monitored as the plant progresses to its new full power output of approximately megawatts 
after the vermont yankee plant uprating is completed  our percentage of energy output under vermont yankee s contract with envy would decline proportionately such that we would receive the same quantity of energy from the plant 
in the event that envy were later derated  then our rights to energy output would decline proportionately to the derating 
if this were to occur  we estimate it would have a material adverse effect on power supply costs 
in this event we would seek recovery of these costs from the vpsb 
envy has announced that  under current operating parameters  it will exhaust the capacity of its existing nuclear waste storage pool in or and will need to store nuclear waste in so called dry fuel storage facilities to be constructed on the site 
vermont law requires envy to obtain approval of the vermont state legislature  in addition to vpsb approval  to construct and use such dry fuel storage facilities 
envy received approval from the legislature in and is awaiting approval from the vpsb 
if envy is unsuccessful in receiving favorable regulatory approval  envy has announced that it could be required to shut down the vermont yankee plant between and if the vermont yankee plant is shut down in or  we would have to acquire substitute baseload power resources  comprising approximately percent of our load 
at projected forward market prices at december  for  we estimate the annual incremental cost in excess of the projected costs of power under our power supply contract for output from the vermont yankee plant would be approximately million per year 
recovery of those increased costs in rates would require a rate increase of approximately percent 
regulatory risk management believes that fair regulatory treatment is crucial to maintaining its financial stability  including its ability to attract capital 
principal regulatory risks for the company relate to the relative frequency and magnitude of rate increases sought in contested retail rate filings 
regulatory lag and uncertainty regarding the outcome of rate proceedings contributes to the risk that we will not achieve our allowed rate of return in any given year 
the company expects to request a retail rate increase of between ten and fifteen percent in to be effective january  principal reasons for the expected rate increase request include forecasted higher replacement energy costs upon expiration of the morgan stanley contract on december   increased energy costs for uncovered load obligations and a forecasted increase in transmission expense 
forecasted amounts could change materially based on energy prices  the timing of transmission investments and other factors 
for example  every per mwh change in replacement energy costs for the morgan stanley contract will result in a percent increase or decrease in the magnitude of the rate increase sought by the company for price changes of per mwh or more on a weekly or monthly basis commonly occurred in electric rates in vermont are currently among the lowest in the region due in large part to vermont utilities relatively low cost  long term contracts with vynpc and hydro quebec 
since  the company s need for rate relief has been modest  reflecting only scheduled rate increases of percent in and percent in under the rate plan 
in august  we extended our morgan stanley contract before wholesale market power supply prices increased and we have been able to pass those benefits along to our customers 
the magnitude of the retail rate increase that the company expects to seek for  while significant  is below that of many other utility companies in vermont and new england 
our retail rates through are set by our rate plan 
vermont does not have a fuel or purchased power adjustment clause that would allow increases in power supply costs to be recovered immediately in the rates we charge customers 
historically  however  the vpsb has allowed electric utilities to defer material unexpected increases in power supply costs to future periods to permit recovery in future rates 
obtaining a change in retail rates generally requires a rate proceeding that lasts for a period of eight and one half months 
vermont law also allows electric utilities to seek temporary rate increases if deemed necessary by the vpsb to provide adequate and efficient service or to preserve the viability of the utility 
additionally  vermont law permits alternative regulation that could potentially provide mechanisms to adjust rates for changes in power supply expense  if approved by the vpsb 
the company expects to pursue an alternative regulation plan for that would contain a power supply and transmission expense rate adjustment clause 
electric utility rates in vermont are set based on the utility s cost of service 
as a result  vermont electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
sfas allows regulated entities  including the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company has recognized revenues deferred under previous regulatory orders to help it earn a fair rate of return see earnings summary 
the company s ability consistently to achieve its allowed rate of return is likely to be more uncertain prospectively due to the absence of available deferred revenues  unless it secures appropriate and adequate rate increases to cover its costs of operation 
vermont is the only state in the new england region that has not adopted some form of electric industry restructuring 
the company  like all other electric utilities in vermont  accordingly operates as a vertically integrated electric utility  with the obligation to serve all customers in our service territory with electrical transmission  distribution and energy supplies sufficient to satisfy customer load requirements 
customer concentration risk ibm  the company s largest customer  operates a manufacturing facility in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its facility accounted for approximately  and percent of the company s retail mwh sales in  and  respectively  and  and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in  and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any year 
ibm has reduced its vermont workforce by approximately  since  to a level of approximately  employees 
company revenue from sales of electricity to ibm decreased by approximately  in compared with company revenue from sales of electricity to ibm increased by approximately  in compared with our operating results are not adversely impacted by reductions in sales to ibm because ibm s retail rates have recently been below wholesale market prices 
we are not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
we currently estimate  based on a number of projected variables  that a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility  inclusive of the tertiary effects on commercial and residential customers  would not necessitate retail rate increases because the company could sell contracted power supply resources into the wholesale market at rates in excess of those charged to ibm 
this estimate would change materially as a result of any significant reductions in energy prices or increases in retail rates paid by ibm 
pension and postretirement health care risk other critical accounting policies involve the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans 
the reported costs of these plans depend upon numerous factors relating to actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and postretirement health care costs are affected by actual employee demographics  company contributions to the plans  earnings on plan assets and  for our postretirement health care plan  health care cost trends 
the company contributed approximately million  million and million to its defined benefit plans during  and  respectively  and we expect to contribute approximately million during and in future years 
our pension and postretirement health care benefit plan assets consist of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may increase or decrease costs in future periods 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded defined benefit plan costs 
on december   the company s employees ratified a four year labor agreement that provides annual wage increases of between and percent and improved k and pension benefits for employees 
this labor agreement caps future postretirement healthcare employee benefits provided by the company for the majority of the present workforce 
the cap on postretirement healthcare benefits is set approximately percent above costs and grows at a percent annual rate 
this cap is expected to reduce the rate at which postretirement healthcare expenses grow in the future 
as a result of our plan asset experience  at december   the company was required to recognize an additional minimum liability of million  net of applicable income taxes 
the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
favorable pension plan investment returns during reduced the oci charge and related net liability by  in and  a reduction in the pension plan s discount rate was primarily responsible for increasing the oci charge and related net liability by  and  respectively 
the and oci charges and the oci benefit had only an indirect effect on net income by adjusting the amount of equity used in the allowed rate of return on equity calculation 
customer service quality the company has agreed to customer service performance requirements that impose penalties up to approximately  in the event that the company does not achieve certain goals 
the company has not only achieved the performance requirement metrics  but typically exceeds the measurements 
the company continues to enhance its use of technology to improve its performance and does not expect its measurements to fall below the prescribed limits 
weather the company periodically uses weather insurance to mitigate some of the risk of lost electricity sales caused by unfavorable weather conditions 
the company did not procure coverage for since forward energy prices approximated average retail rate levels

wholesale revenues increased by million in  compared with the prior year  reflecting substantially higher market prices for electricity 
these higher prices also affected the prices paid for wholesale market purchases 
other operating revenue more than doubled  increasing revenue by million and reflected a million increase from the sale of utility services to other utilities and large industrial customers 
other operating expense increased by a similar amount  reflecting the cost of sales for these activities 
in  retail and other revenues increased million or percent compared with  due to an increase of million in recognition of revenues deferred under the rate plan  a percent increase in megawatt hour sales to large commercial and industrial customers resulting in a million increase in revenue  and a percent increase in megawatt hour sales to small commercial and industrial customers resulting in a million increase in revenue 
residential retail revenues and megawatt hour sales of electricity were up only percent in  compared with we experienced residential customer growth in  but weather conditions were less favorable for electricity sales than wholesale revenues decreased in by million  or percent  compared with  reflecting reduced sales of electricity under the morgan stanley contract 
the reduction in sales under the morgan stanley contract did not adversely affect the company s earnings in and is not expected to adversely affect the company s earnings in future years 
power supply expenses power supply expenses constituted  and percent of total operating expenses for the years  and  respectively 
most of the decrease is attributable to reduced purchases and sales of electricity under the morgan stanley contract 
power supply expenses increased by million in when compared with  and resulted from the following a million increase in the cost of market purchases caused primarily by higher wholesale market prices million and a reduction of credits for the auction of transmission rights allocated by iso ne  a million increase in power supply expenses under agreements with hydro quebec caused by increased megawatt hour purchases of electricity  a million increase in purchases from morgan stanley caused primarily by an increase in contract prices  and a  increase in the costs of electricity supplied by independent power producers caused by production increases due to higher levels of precipitation 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in the cost of power under our contract with vermont yankee 
power supply expenses decreased by million or percent in when compared with  and resulted from the following an estimated million decrease in the cost of power purchased for resale resulting primarily from the restructuring of the morgan stanley contract described above  a million increase in credits from the iso ne resulting from ftr auctions designed to make congested regions pay a premium for energy delivery  and credits for certain company generation  and a million decrease in the net cost of our agreement with hydro quebec 
these decreases were partially offset by increased power supply expenses from the following a million increase in purchases to supply increased retail sales  an estimated million in purchases to replace reduced energy deliveries under the vjo contract as a result of problems with the transmission interconnection facilities over which we schedule deliveries  and an  increase in the contract price per megawatt hour of electricity purchased under the morgan stanley contract 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with  primarily as a result of a million increase in expenses associated with the sale of utility services and an  increase in administrative and general expenses 
other operating expenses in increased million  or percent  in compared with  primarily as a result of an increase in expenses associated with the sale of utility services 
transmission expenses transmission expenses increased  or percent  in compared with resulting from a  increase in system wide allocation of costs associated with voltage control and reactive power var in new england 
the remainder of the increase is due primarily to increased sales of energy and investment in velco transmission facilities allocable to the company 
transmission expenses increased  or percent  in compared with  due to increased charges allocated by iso ne for var in new england and engineering studies related to substation and transmission design evaluations 
the company s relative share of transmission expenses varies with the peak demand recorded on vermont s transmission system 
the company s share of those expenses increased due to its increased load growth  relative to other vermont utilities  and also because of increased transmission investment by velco 
iso ne was created to manage the operations of the new england power pool nepool  effective may  iso ne operates a market for all new england states for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
iso ne implemented its standard market design smd plan governing wholesale energy sales in new england on march  smd includes a system of locational marginal pricing of energy  under which prices are determined by zone  and based in part on transmission congestion experienced in each zone 
currently  the state of vermont constitutes a single zone under the plan 
ferc has granted approval to iso ne to become a regional transmission organization rto for new england 
on february   iso ne commenced operations as the rto  providing regional transmission service in new england  with operational control of the bulk power system and responsibility for administering wholesale markets 
commencing with implementation of the rto  costs associated with certain transmission facilities  known as the highgate facilities  of which the company is a part owner  will be phased into region wide rates over a year period 
when fully phased in  we estimate that this roll in of the highgate facilities will achieve approximately million in annual transmission costs savings for the company 
velco  the owner and operator of vermont s principal electric transmission system assets  has proposed a project to substantially upgrade vermont s transmission system the northwest reliability project  principally to support reliability and eliminate transmission constraints in northwestern vermont  including most of the company s service territory 
we own approximately percent of velco 
in january  the project received regulatory approval from the vpsb 
the project is estimated to cost approximately million through velco intends to finance the costs of constructing the northwest reliability project in part through increased equity investment 
in october  the company invested million in velco to support this project and other transmission projects 
the company plans to invest up to million additionally in velco through  for the same purpose  assuming that velco maintains a capital structure of percent debt and percent equity 
under current nepool and iso ne rules  which require qualifying large transmission project costs to be shared among all new england utilities  approximately percent of the pool transmission facility costs of the northwest reliability project will be allocated throughout the new england region  with vermont utilities responsible for approximately percent of allocated costs 
vermont utilities are required to pay percent of pool transmission facility upgrades in other new england states 
maintenance expenses maintenance expense increased million or percent in compared with  due to a  increase in maintenance expenditures on gas turbines and a  increase in distribution expenses  principally for right of way maintenance programs 
maintenance expenses increased  or percent in compared with due to increased expenditures on right of way maintenance programs offset by decreased expenditures related to gas turbine maintenance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million in or percent compared with due to a  increase in depreciation of utility plant in service and a  increase in amortization of conservation expenditures 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or percent  in compared with due to increases in depreciation of utility plant in service partially offset by decreased amortization of software costs 
taxes other than income taxes other than income taxes decreased  or percent  in compared with due to a  decrease in property tax offset partially by a  increase in gross revenue tax 
taxes other than income taxes decreased  in  or percent  compared with due to decreased property tax expense 
income taxes income tax expense decreased  or percent  in compared with due to a decrease in the company s pre tax income 
income tax expense increased  or percent  primarily due to an increase in pre tax income in compared with total other income net of other deductions total other income decreased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to  of one time gains in on the sale of non utility property  and a decrease of  in equity returns capitalized on regulatory assets in  partially offset by increased earnings of velco 
other income and deductions increased  in compared with due primarily to sales of non utility property offset by reduced earnings on investment in vermont yankee 
interest expense interest expense increased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to a  decrease in interest capitalized on conservation expenditures that are being recovered under the company s rate plan 
once plant or regulatory assets begin to be recovered in the rates we collect  interest is no longer capitalized on those assets 
interest expense decreased  or percent  in compared with primarily due to scheduled redemptions of long term debt in december environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations 
the company joined the chicago climate exchange ccx  a self regulatory exchange that administers a market for reducing and trading greenhouse gas emission credits 
we were the first utility in the northeast to join the ccx  and have committed voluntarily to reduce our emissions by percent below our baseline average by  either directly or by purchasing credits

pine street barge canal superfund site in  the company entered into a united states district court consent decree constituting a final settlement with the united states environmental protection agency epa  the state of vermont and numerous other parties of claims relating to a federal superfund site in burlington  vermont  known as the pine street barge canal 
the consent decree resolves claims by the epa for past site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future remediation costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
in  and  the company expended million  million and million  respectively  to cover its obligations under the consent decree and we have estimated total future costs of the company s future obligations under the consent decree to be million 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we have recorded a regulatory asset of million to reflect unrecovered past and future pine street costs 
pursuant to the company s rate plan  as approved by the vpsb  the company began to amortize past unrecovered costs in the company expects to amortize the full amount of incurred costs over years without a return 
if there were a substantial increase in pine street remediation costs  it could result in an adverse impact on earnings under our current earnings cap calculation 
rates during february  the company requested that the vpsb grant an accounting order to allow us to defer approximately million in incremental hurricane related power supply expenses to be incurred in the first quarter of  and to also allow the company to defer and amortize million of incremental hurricane related benefits realized in the fourth quarter of against these costs 
the accounting order was approved by the vpsb in february  allowing the company to defer power supply expenses up to million in the first quarter of on december   the vpsb approved our rate plan  jointly proposed by the company and the dps 
the rate plan covers the period from through and includes the following principal elements the company s rates remained unchanged through the rate plan allows the company to raise rates percent  effective january   and an additional percent  effective january  we submitted a cost of service schedule supporting the rate increases for and in accordance with the plan and the increases became effective on january  and january  the vpsb retains the discretion to open an investigation of the company s rates at any time  at the request of the dps  the request of ratepayers  or on its own volition 
the company may seek additional rate increases or deferral of costs in extraordinary circumstances  such as severe storm repair costs  natural disasters  extended unanticipated unit outages  or significant losses of customer load 
the company s allowed return on equity is capped at percent for the period january  through december  certain exclusions  commonly made in setting rates  make it unlikely that the company will achieve its allowed return on equity for its core utility operations 
excess earnings in or will be refunded to customers as a credit on customer bills or applied to reduce regulatory assets  as the department directs 
the company carried forward into million in deferred revenue remaining at december   from the company s settlement order summarized below 
these revenues were applied in to offset increased costs 
the company began amortizing recovering  in january  certain regulatory assets  including pine street barge canal environmental site costs and past demand side management program costs  with those amortizations to be allowed in future rates 
pine street costs will be recovered over a twenty year period without a return 
the company and the department have agreed to work cooperatively to develop and propose an alternative regulation plan as authorized by legislation enacted in vermont in in january  the vpsb issued the settlement order  which included the following rates were set at levels that recover the company s vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company from through  the company and customers shall share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  adjusted for inflation  and the company s further investment in non utility operations was restricted until new rates went into effect  which occurred in january although this restriction has expired  we have no plans to make material investments in non utility operations 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  net working capital and net operating cash flows are as follows at december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents current assets less current liabilities net working capital net cash provided by operating activities cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million in operating cash flows increased by million from the prior year as a result of a retail rate increase that replaced deferred revenue recognition in  increases in depreciation and amortization  and an increase in taxes payable arising primarily from stronger than expected fourth quarter results 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million  principally for investments to construct utility plant 
we expect most of our utility construction expenditures and dividends to be financed by net cash provided by operating activities 
we expect to finance our increasing investment in velco through debt issuance 
we anticipate that we will issue long term debt of approximately million in for scheduled first mortgage bond redemptions of million and to refinance accumulated short term debt arising from investments in velco 
material risks to cash flow from operations include regulatory risk  power supply risks  slower than anticipated load growth and unfavorable economic conditions 
construction and investments our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
the company plans to invest approximately million in velco through  assuming that velco maintains a capital structure of percent debt and percent equity  including million of planned investment during our planned investments will fund an increase in the amount of equity in velco s capital structure and increased transmission investment  principally driven by construction of the northwest reliability project and other vermont construction projects 
future capital expenditures are expected to approximate million annually 
expected reductions in pine street remediation costs should be offset by increased generation expenditures 
capital expenditures over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution other total in thousands actual forecast other includes pine street barge canal net expenditures of million in million in  million in  and an estimated million in dividend policy the company expects to increase the annual dividend on its common stock in the first quarter of each year until the payout ratio falls in the middle of a payout range of between percent and percent of anticipated earnings  so long as financial and operating results permit 
we believe this payout ratio to be consistent with that of other electric utilities having similar risk profiles 
our recent dividend history is as follows period reflecting dividend change new annual dividend rate annual payout ratio st quarter n a st quarter st quarter th quarter payout ratio computed as annual dividend rate divided by annual earnings from continuing operations 
financing and capitalization during june  the company negotiated a day revolving credit agreement the fleet sovereign agreement with fleet financial services fleet joined by sovereign bank 
the fleet sovereign agreement is for million  unsecured  and allows the company to choose any blend of a daily variable prime rate and a fixed term libor based rate 
there was no short term debt outstanding on the fleet sovereign agreement at december  there was million outstanding on the fleet sovereign agreement at december  at an average rate of percent 
there was no non utility short term debt outstanding at december  or the fleet sovereign agreement expires june  the company anticipates that it will secure financing that replaces some or all of its expiring facilities during we expect to increase the term of the revolving credit facility to between three and five years subject to vpsb approval during the credit ratings of the company s first mortgage bonds at december  were moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds baa bbb performance assurance the company is subject to performance assurance requirements associated with its power purchase and sale transactions through iso ne under the financial assurance policy for nepool members 
while the company is generally a net seller to iso ne  it must post collateral if the net amount owed exceeds its credit limit at iso ne 
a company s credit limit is calculated as a percentage  based on its credit rating  of its net worth 
the company s present credit limit with iso ne is approximately million 
iso ne reviews collateral requirements on a daily basis 
as of december   the company had no collateral requirements with iso ne 
the company is also subject to performance assurance requirements under the vynpc contract to purchase power from vermont yankee 
if envy  the seller  has commercially reasonable grounds for insecurity regarding the company s ability to pay for its monthly purchases  envy may ask vynpc and vynpc may then ask the company to provide adequate financial assurance payment 
the company has never been requested to post collateral under this contract 
in the event of a change in the company s first mortgage bond credit rating to below investment grade  scheduled payments under the company s first mortgage bonds would not be affected 
such a change would require the company to post what would currently amount to a million bond under our remediation agreement with the epa regarding the pine street barge canal site 
the morgan stanley contract requires credit assurances if the company s first mortgage bond credit ratings are lowered to below investment grade by either of the credit rating agencies listed above 
the company typically utilizes eei standard contracts for residual power supply contractual arrangements that contain triggers that require posting of letters of credit or other credit assurances if amounts due the creditor party exceed certain thresholds  frequently tied to the company s credit rating 
while the company s principal long term contracts do not contain these strict provisions  if replacement contracts were entered into today  they likely would contain specified collateral thresholds and credit rating triggers 
we do not expect additional material amounts of expense from these terms
