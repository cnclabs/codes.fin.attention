item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview checkfree was founded in as an electronic payment processing company and has become a leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services 
our current business was developed through the expansion of our core electronic payments business and the acquisition of companies operating in similar or complementary businesses 
we operate our business through three independent but inter related divisions electronic commerce  investment services  and software 
through our electronic commerce division  we enable consumers to receive and pay bills

the number of transactions we process each year continues to grow 
for the year ended june   growth in the number of transactions processed exceeded

the software division accounted for approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenues 
executive summary our year ended june  included a number of events in our results of operations as a whole the expiration of our agreements with first data corporation fdc in august and microsoft corporation microsoft in december and the related cessation of amortization of intangible assets resulting from our september acquisition of msfdc  llc transpoint in september  slower than expected transaction growth in the quarter ended june  the negative impact on interest based revenue of our largest bank customer migrating from a processing model that guarantees funds to our standard risk based processing model during the quarter ended march  our acquisition of phonecharge  inc phonecharge  for million in cash in january  our purchase of substantially all the assets of integrated data systems  inc ids for million in cash in september  our purchase of substantially all of the assets of aphelion  inc aphelion for million in cash in october  our prior year acquisition of accurate in april  having a full year impact on our results compared to less than three months in the prior year  
table of contents the divestiture of our m solutions business unit for million in february  and our becoming a full tax payer during the year  having utilized substantially all of the tax credits we earned in prior years 
due to growth in all of our business segments  including both the positive and negative impacts of the items identified above  our consolidated revenue grew by approximately during the year ended june  in addition  with the reduction in amortization expense from transpoint intangible assets that fully amortized in the quarter ended september   we earned net income from continuing operations of million for the year ended june   an increase of over the million earned in the previous year 
through continued efforts to improve quality and efficiency  and despite our tax payments increasing million more than the amount we paid in fiscal year including the tax on the gain on our sale of m solutions  we generated nearly million of free cash flow for the year ended june   compared to million in the previous year 
this free cash flow  combined with cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million as of june   allowed us to acquire phonecharge and substantially all of the assets of both ids and aphelion  and to repurchase over  shares of our common stock for million during the year ended june  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement accounts  less capital expenditures  plus data center reimbursements 
see use of non gaap financial information for further discussion of this measure 
as we entered fiscal year  we prepared for the expiration of our five year agreements with microsoft and fdc  resulting from our acquisition of transpoint 
our contracts with both microsoft and fdc included monthly minimum revenue guarantees that increased annually over their five year term 
the following table represents the total annual minimum revenue guarantees throughout the contract periods with the respective customer in thousands fiscal year ended june  microsoft fdc total total both agreements operated substantially below their monthly minimum levels from inception to expiration 
our agreement with fdc expired in august  and our agreement with microsoft expired in december our electronic commerce division generated revenue growth of approximately for the year ended june  over the prior year 
we processed more than billion payment transactions  an increase of more than over the prior year 
we delivered nearly million e bills during fiscal year  for growth of about over the level of e bills delivered in the prior year 
in addition to the expected decline in revenue from microsoft and fdc  our largest bank customer migrated from a processing model that guarantees funds to our standard risk based model during the quarter ended march   resulting in a substantial decrease in our interest based revenue 
in january  we acquired phonecharge  a provider of telephone based bill payment services 
along with additional biller relationships  phonecharge brought us telephone bill payment capabilities with credit card based payment capability and a base of over million transactions per quarter 
in october  we purchased substantially all of the assets of aphelion  a provider of health club management software and services 
the addition of aphelion expands the number of clubs we serve  strengthens our presence in the mid sized and independent club markets  and brings us prospective electronic funds transfer customers 
successful efforts to improve efficiency and quality have resulted in lower costs per transaction  allowing us to share scale efficiencies with our customers through reduced revenue per transaction 
when combined with the aforementioned loss of high margin revenue minimums and interest based revenue  our year over year operating margin dropped by about two percentage points during fiscal year during the quarter ended june   we experienced sequential quarterly transaction growth of  which was lower than our expectations  resulting in our electronic commerce 
table of contents division falling short of expected revenue and operating income 
we experienced a greater than expected dip in transactions in april combined with transaction growth for the rest of the quarter that was not as significant as previous years  and a slowdown in consumer activity at our largest bank customer 
this phenomenon was not solely bank based  as transaction growth slowed in all payment channels on line  biller direct  walk in and phone based transactions 
we are not fully certain as to all of the reasons for this lower than anticipated transaction growth and we continue to analyze consumer and payment activity 
our investment services division generated growth in portfolios managed  from million as of june   to nearly million as of june   resulting in revenue growth of over the same period 
during fiscal  we continued to invest heavily in the rewrite of our checkfree apl operating system 
despite the resulting lower near term operating margin  we expect this investment to provide us the opportunity to expand our services in the rapidly expanding separately managed accounts sma and smas market 
in september  we purchased substantially all of the assets of ids  a provider of enterprise portfolio management solutions to the financial services industry 
this acquisition extends our client base to include more participants in the investment management industry and will allow us to drive further growth into this market 
it also provides us with additional technology  including new brokerage performance reporting tools 
in february  we divested our m solutions business 
this divestiture allows us to focus on our primary strategy of driving growth in the managed accounts market 
we expect our operating margin in investment services to remain in the mid to upper teens level until we complete our system rewrite and the related migration of our customer base 
our software division increased its revenue in fiscal year by over the same period last year 
this increase  driven primarily by our acquisition of accurate late in fiscal year  was the result of increased license sales of our operational risk management orm software  and increased implementation and consulting services 
our orm product offerings include account reconciliation and settlement  exception and risk management  and workflow and business intelligence processing capabilities that allow customers to perform consistent  repeatable  and compliant processes at the enterprise level 
after several years of extended sales cycles and dampened demand for software in general  in fiscal year  we saw a strengthening of our sales pipeline and a renewal of customer interest toward investment in software solutions 
as we enter into fiscal  both revenue and earnings growth will be impacted by the carryover effect of the expired microsoft and fdc minimum revenue guarantees and a full year of negative impact on interest based revenue from our largest bank customer s shift in processing models within our electronic commerce business 
we expect to generate free cash flow of between and million in fiscal year  which is net of approximately million of capital associated with ongoing capital investments into our business and exclusive of data center construction costs financed with the proceeds of a lease facility 
when combined with cash  cash equivalents  and investments totaling million and an untapped million line of credit  we believe we are positioned to take advantage of additional opportunities for acquisitions as they arise  and we have authority to repurchase up to million of our common stock through july   should we determine the time and price to be appropriate 
as you review our historical financial information in this annual report  you should be aware that  in the quarter ended march   we divested of m solutions  a component of our investment services segment 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we report the results of operations from the divested business separately as earnings from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
therefore  we have restated historical statements of operations data for   and to exclude m solutions from income from continuing operations

total revenues s june  change year ended our growth in total revenues of was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our investment services business and growth in our software business 
overall growth in electronic commerce  including our new telephone bill pay business acquired in january  continued to be driven primarily by growth in transactions processed  from almost million in the year ended june   to more than billion in the year ended june  we also delivered nearly million e bills during fiscal  a growth rate of over about million e bills delivered during fiscal as interest rates continued to rise throughout fiscal  we experienced revenue growth in our interest sensitive products such as account balance transfer abt 
finally  we earned modest revenue growth from our october acquisition of aphelion 
revenue growth was negatively impacted by several factors over the year 
we have 
table of contents established pricing models that provide volume based discounts in order to share scale efficiencies with our customers 
therefore  as a result of significant transaction growth and better utilization of efficiencies of scale  our average revenue per transaction continued to decline with respect to our transaction based revenue 
during fiscal  our transpoint related contracts with microsoft and fdc expired  which  on a combined basis  negatively impacted revenue growth by about in the year 
also  our largest bank customer migrated from a processing model that guarantees funds to our standard risk based processing model  which negatively impacted our interest based revenue and resulted in the loss of another percentage point of revenue growth in fiscal growth in our investment services business has been driven primarily by a increase in portfolios managed  from million at june   to nearly million at june  in some cases  we are adding new portfolios to our checkfree apl system at a lower price point  driven by the increased volume coming from lower priced broker dealers  and by conscious price reductions  where we trade off near term revenue growth against long term strategic advantage 
additionally  our september acquisition of ids improved fiscal revenue growth within investment services by about 
we believe that more favorable market conditions have resulted in resumed growth in portfolios managed  and we remain cautiously optimistic about resulting growth opportunities 
growth in our software business was due primarily to a full year of accurate operations in fiscal as compared to less than three months of accurate operations in fiscal as a result of the effective integration of accurate  we have achieved solid growth in our orm line of business 
we believe this to be the combined result of improved execution within the software division and improvement in the us economy during fiscal across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeded of our consolidated revenues 
the majority of this revenue comes from within our electronic commerce division 
bank of america revenue was positively impacted by their acquisitions of fleet bank  not previously a customer of ours  and mbna  which was previously a customer but whose results are now included in bank of america revenue 
our electronic commerce agreement with bank of america has a year term expiring in the contract includes annual minimum revenue guarantees of million  provides tiered pricing which reflects the volume of activity provided by bank of america and provides for up to million incentive based warrants that the bank can earn upon reaching various levels of subscriber adoption and the delivery of e bills 
bank of america remains the only customer that exceeds of our consolidated revenues 
the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended we earn processing and servicing revenue in both our electronic commerce and our investment services businesses 
while stable growth in portfolios managed in our investment services business continues to contribute positively  the increase in processing and servicing revenue is attributed primarily to the aforementioned transaction growth in our electronic commerce business 
annual growth in transactions was favorably influenced by our new phone based bill payment offering  resulting from the acquisition of phonecharge in january our traditional electronic bill payment products provided the remainder of growth within electronic commerce 
during fiscal  we delivered nearly million e bills  representing growth over the million e bills delivered during fiscal  with an average price of per e bill in each year 
additionally  with interest rates rising over the past fiscal year  we have experienced revenue growth from our interest sensitive products 
annual volume based growth in processing and servicing revenue was somewhat offset by tier based volume pricing discounts within both our electronic commerce and investment services businesses 
additionally  growth was negatively impacted by the aforementioned expiration of our processing contracts with microsoft in december and fdc in august  and the impact on interest based revenue resulting from our largest bank customer migrating to a risk based processing model during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended june   we experienced sequential quarterly transaction growth of  which was lower than our expectations  resulting in our electronic 
table of contents commerce division falling short of expected revenue and operating income 
we experienced a greater than expected dip in transactions in april combined with transaction growth for the rest of the quarter that was not as significant as previous years  and a slowdown in consumer activity at our largest bank customer 
this phenomenon was not solely bank based  as transaction growth slowed in all payment channels on line  biller direct  walk in and phone based transactions 
we are not fully certain as to all of the reasons for this lower than anticipated transaction growth and we continue to analyze consumer and payment activity 
license fee revenue s june  change year ended we derive license fee revenue almost entirely from product sales in our software division 
our acquisition of accurate in april contributed significantly to our license revenue growth in fiscal as integration efforts with our core products resulted in a significant increase in sales of our orm product line 
sales of our integrated orm product line are improving both domestically and internationally  and we are guardedly optimistic about our license sale growth opportunities as we enter fiscal maintenance fee revenue s june  change year ended maintenance fee revenue  which represents annually renewable product support for our license based customers  is related primarily to our software business  and tends to grow with incremental license sales from previous periods 
however  our fiscal acquisition of accurate provided about half of our year over year growth in maintenance revenue 
the remainder resulted from annual customer retention rates that continue to exceed and modest price increases across our software product lines 
professional fee revenue s june  change year ended professional fee revenue consists primarily of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our businesses 
our expanded product lines over the past several years have given us additional opportunities to provide professional services to our customers 
on a year over year basis  we generated increased revenue from software services engagements across several products  more biller implementation engagement revenue  and realized a positive impact from our acquisitions of accurate in april  ids in september and aphelion in october 
table of contents the following set of tables provides line by line expense comparisons with their relative percentages of our consolidated revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of processing  servicing and support s june  revenue revenue year ended cost of processing  servicing and support  as a percentage of revenue  improved by about on a year over year basis 
in both electronic commerce and investment services  we continue to focus investment on additional efficiency and quality improvements within our customer care processes and our information technology infrastructure  and are leveraging a significantly fixed cost infrastructure to drive improvement in cost per transaction and cost per portfolio managed 
within electronic commerce  while our electronic payment rate hovered around for over a year  our january acquisition of phonecharge added electronic phone based payment transactions  helping to raise and maintain our electronic payment rate at 
electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care claim 
it is difficult to raise the electronic rate above the level as it takes an increasing number of relatively small merchants to sign up for electronic payment receipt to move the number a single percentage point 
also  a portion of the phonecharge transactions are credit card payments  carrying interchange fees  which place downward pressure on gross margins for that part of the business 
relatively high growth in credit card payments in the future could place downward pressure on the gains we expect from continued six sigma based process improvement programs within electronic commerce and investment services 
looking to the future  we expect some near term pressure on our gross margin as we invest in resources to support our high availability disaster recovery efforts 
these efforts began in earnest in the quarter ended june   and we expect continued incremental investment in these areas throughout fiscal research and development s june  revenue revenue year ended including capitalized development costs of million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june   gross expenditures for research and development were million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended june   and million  or of consolidated revenues  for the year ended june  in addition to increased research and development costs resulting from our acquisitions of accurate in april  ids in september  aphelion in october and phonecharge in january  we continue to invest in product enhancement and productivity improvement initiatives in all of our core businesses 
in particular  a rewrite of our operating system within investment services which is currently scheduled for availability and initial customer migrations in the second half of fiscal is the primary driver of the increase in research and development costs as a percentage of revenue on a year over year basis 
sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended 
table of contents the increase in sales and marketing expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  was due primarily to our acquisitions of accurate in april  ids in september  aphelion in october and phonecharge in january these businesses provided non redundant marketing personnel  sales commissions and program costs and accounted for over of our incremental sales and marketing costs in fiscal however  we have continued to invest in incremental marketing programs and resources designed to further revenue growth in all of our business segments 
general and administrative s june  revenue revenue year ended although general and administrative expenses continue to increase  we experienced improvement in general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
while we have incurred incremental costs associated with our various acquisitions over the past year  we have been able to effectively leverage corporate general and administrative resources through elimination of redundancy 
additionally  during fiscal  we incurred significant sarbanes oxley act section compliance costs in preparation for our first internal control certification as of june  once initial documentation and testing standards were established  we experienced a reduction in these compliance costs throughout fiscal subject to unforeseen issues  we expect to continue to manage our general and administrative costs to a level between and of total revenue 
depreciation and amortization s june  revenue revenue year ended depreciation and amortization expenses from operating fixed assets and capitalized software development costs increased modestly from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the remainder of the change in depreciation and amortization expense represents a net reduction in acquisition related amortization 
despite additional amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from accurate in april  ids in september  aphelion in october and phonecharge in january  acquisition related amortization expense decreased overall from intangible assets that fully amortized during fiscal in particular  completion of the amortization of the transpoint strategic agreements resulted in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million on a year over year basis 
these strategic agreements  which provided million of amortization expense in fiscal  fully amortized by the end of the first quarter of fiscal reorganization charge s june  revenue revenue year ended late in the quarter ended june   we terminated the employment of approximately associates  re scoping many positions with the intent to re hire quickly  and eliminating some others 
as part of this action  we moved our electronic billing and payment operations from waterloo  ontario  canada to norcross  georgia  and closed the canadian facility in october these actions resulted in a charge of million 

table of contents equity in loss of joint venture s june  revenue revenue year ended in april  we announced a joint venture  onevu limited onevu  with voca limited voca  in the united kingdom to create an integrated electronic billing and payment network for billers and banks in the united kingdom 
we have a equity interest in onevu  therefore  we account for our interest in onevu under the equity method of accounting 
we provided of onevu s necessary working capital requirements during its formative stage  and therefore  the equity in net loss of onevu represents of the loss incurred by onevu through march  in march  we entered into an additional funding arrangement with voca related to onevu whereby both joint venture partners contributed approximately  in exchange for a security interest subordinate to our previous funding 
onevu obtained a line of credit facility from a bank in the amount of approximately million 
accordingly  beginning in april  we continued to record the operations of onevu on the equity basis of accounting recognizing only of the results of operations of onevu 
during the three years ended june   we invested  in the joint venture 
net interest s june  revenue revenue year ended interest income interest expense net interest as a result of an increase in average cash and invested assets  combined with rising interest rates during fiscal  our interest income increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  our interest expense decreased by million as capital lease and other borrowings remained fairly consistent in total over the past fiscal year 
gain on investments s june  revenue revenue year ended in the quarter ended march   we recorded a million gain on the sale of stock

table of contents income tax expense s june  effective rate effective rate year ended our federal statutory tax rate is  and our overall blended statutory rate federal  state and foreign combined approached without the benefit of tax planning strategies 
our effective rate of for the year ended june   was lower than our blended statutory rate due to tax free municipal interest income and foreign tax credits recorded during the fiscal year 
our effective rate of for the year ended june   was lower than our blended statutory rate due to tax free municipal interest income and research and experimentation tax credits 
earnings from discontinued operations s june  revenue revenue year ended in the quarter ended march   we divested the assets of m solutions  a component of investment services 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lives assets  requires that we report the results of operations from the divested business  including the million gain on the sale  separately as earnings from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
other than the gain itself  m solutions historically provided modest earnings on an annual basis 
income tax expense on discontinued operations s june  effective rate effective rate year ended our earnings from discontinued operations include a million gain on the sale of m solutions in the year ended june  our book basis gain on the sale includes the impact of the related write off of goodwill  which is non deductible for income tax purposes 
the higher tax basis gain on the sale resulted in an effective rate of for fiscal with no impact of non deductible expenses in fiscal  our effective rate was years ended june  and the following table sets forth our consolidated revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
total revenues s june  change year ended our growth in total revenues of was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our investment services business and growth in our software business

this combined growth in our electronic commerce division was partially offset by our pricing practices 
we established pricing models that provide volume based discounts in order to share scale efficiencies with our customers 
as a result of transaction growth  our average revenue per transaction therefore  has declined over time with respect to our transaction based revenue 
growth in our investment services business was driven primarily by a increase in portfolios managed  from about million at june   to million at june  in some cases  we were adding new portfolios to our checkfree apl system at a lower price point  driven by the increased volume coming from lower priced broker dealers  and by conscious price reductions  where we trade off near term revenue growth against long term strategic advantage 
growth in our software business was due primarily to a full year of heliograph operations in fiscal versus seven months of heliograph operations in fiscal and our acquisition of accurate on april  additionally  we achieved solid growth in our bank products 
we believe this was the combined result of improved execution within the division and signs of recovery in the us economy 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeded of our consolidated revenues 
bank of america was the only customer that exceeded of our consolidated revenue 
the following tables set forth comparative revenues  by type  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
processing and servicing revenue s june  change year ended we earned processing and servicing revenue in both our electronic commerce and our investment services businesses 
while growth in portfolios managed in our investment services business contributed positively  the increase in processing and servicing revenue was attributable primarily to the aforementioned transaction growth in our electronic commerce business 
annual growth in transactions was heavily influenced by our new walk in payment business  resulting from the acquisition of aps with only seven days remaining in fiscal a full year of walk in payments contributed to almost half of our processing and servicing growth within electronic commerce 
our traditional electronic bill payment products provided the remainder of growth within electronic commerce  with consistent sequential quarterly transaction growth of between and throughout fiscal during fiscal  we delivered approximately million e bills with an average price of per e bill  representing growth over approximately million e bills delivered during fiscal additionally  with interest rates rising over the past fiscal year  we have experienced revenue growth from our interest sensitive products  such as abt

in addition to leveraging a significant fixed cost processing infrastructure  we continued to focus investments on additional efficiency and quality improvements through six sigma based programs in our electronic commerce and investment services customer care and customer support processes  and throughout our technology infrastructure to drive improvement in our cost per transaction and cost per portfolio managed metrics

sales and marketing s june  revenue revenue year ended sales and marketing expenses  in total and as a percentage of consolidated revenues  increased during fiscal our acquisitions of heliograph  aps and accurate contributed approximately of the incremental costs year over year

table of contents years ended june  and electronic commerce segment information electronic commerce revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in electronic commerce was primarily the result of an increase in transactions processed  including those added by our new telephone bill payment business  an increase in e bills distributed  and an increase in revenue from interest sensitive products  offset by volume based price increases  the loss of minimum revenue guarantees resulting from the expiration of processing agreements with microsoft and fdc  and the impact on interest based revenue related to the migration of our largest bank customer to our risk based processing model 
we offer two general levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers a full service offering and a payment services offering 
customers that use our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
a full service customer may or may not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but uses a broad array of services  including payment processing  payment warehousing  claims processing  e bill  online proof of payment  various levels of customer care  and other aspects of our service 
while a full service customer may have its own payment warehouse  we maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a blend of both 
the distinction between full service and payment services is based solely on the types of services the customer receives  not on our pricing methodology 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services  primarily remittance processing  and includes our walk in and telephone payment businesses 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers for electronic bill delivery  biller direct hosting and payments  as well as other payment services  such as abt 
a third category of revenue which we simply refer to as other electronic commerce  includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as consumer service provider and biller implementation and consulting services  and fees associated with the issuance of stored value cards 
the following tables provide an historical trend of revenues  underlying transaction metrics  and subscriber metrics  where appropriate  for our electronic commerce business over the periods presented fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed 
table of contents fiscal quarter ended in millions full service revenue active subscribers transactions processed payment services revenue transactions processed other electronic commerce revenue totals electronic commerce revenue transactions processed we experienced variability in both revenue and transactions processed in our full service category between june  and june  as expected  our contracts with fdc and microsoft expired in august and december  respectively 
because both fdc and microsoft were operating well below minimum guaranteed revenue levels  there was a large negative revenue impact with minimal corresponding impact on transactions processed 
toward the middle of the quarter ended march  and extending through the full quarter ended june   we experienced the negative impact on interest based revenue from our largest bank customer migrating to a processing model that guarantees funds to our standard risk based processing 
finally  in the quarter ended june   we experienced lower than expected growth in transactions processed 
the above  when combined with overall growth in our core full service business  resulted in full service annual revenue growth of approximately  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june   while full service transactions processed grew  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  our normal tier based volume pricing discounts  when combined with the aforementioned factors  resulted in full service revenue per transaction declining from in the quarter ended june   to in the quarter ended june  payment services revenue increased by nearly  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  revenue was positively impacted by growth in e bills delivered from just over million for the year ended june   to almost million for the year ended june   and by our acquisition of phonecharge in january growth in transactions during the same period was over  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in addition to core payment services transaction growth  we added telephone bill payment transactions  priced at greater than each  resulting from our january acquisition of phonecharge 
however  this was more than offset by the quarterly loss of approximately million low priced transactions in the quarter ended december  overall  payment services revenue per transaction increased from in the quarter ended june   to in the quarter ended june  during the quarter ended june   we experienced sequential quarterly transaction growth of  which was lower than our expectations  resulting in our electronic commerce division falling short of expected revenue and operating income 
we experienced a greater than expected dip in transactions in april combined with transaction growth for the rest of the quarter that was not as significant as previous years  and a slowdown in consumer activity at our largest bank customer 
this phenomenon was not solely bank based  as transaction growth slowed in all payment channels on line  biller direct  walk in and phone based transactions 
we are not fully certain as to all of the reasons for this lower than anticipated transaction growth and we continue to analyze consumer and payment activity 

table of contents growth in other electronic commerce revenue from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june   was primarily due to our acquisition of aphelion in october  combined with growth in our legacy health and fitness business 
electronic commerce operating income s june  change year ended our continued efforts to improve quality and efficiency in our operations  combined with a substantial electronic versus paper payment rate of and our ability to leverage our fixed cost base  have resulted in a lower cost per transaction  and have offset volume based pricing discounts inherent in our business 
while our underlying operating margin has remained relatively flat at between and on a year over year basis  our operating margin for the quarter ended june  was approximately 
although offset somewhat by our acquisition of phonecharge  the high margin revenue loss resulting from the expected expiration of our contracts with fdc and microsoft  combined with the negative impact on our interest based revenue from a large bank customer migrating to a processing model that guarantees funds to our standard risk based processing model  resulted in downward pressure on our operating margin as we exited fiscal additionally  while lower than expected transaction growth rate in the quarter ended june  did not significantly impact our operating margin  it did result in lower than expected operating income for that quarter 
we are cautiously optimistic regarding our opportunity for continued growth in operating income within our electronic commerce division 
investment services segment information investment services revenue s june  change year ended revenue growth in investment services was driven primarily by an increase in portfolios managed  from million as of june   to almost million as of june  we continue to provide certain incentives for customers to sign multi year contracts and are experiencing a mix shift toward lower priced services  both of which we expect to result in lower revenue per average portfolio managed 
growth in portfolios managed is typically tied to the growth in the us stock market 
we experienced fairly consistent portfolio growth throughout fiscal we remain cautiously optimistic about the opportunity for continued portfolio growth into fiscal as demand for separately managed accounts continues to improve 
investment services operating income s june  change year ended our underlying operating margin has declined from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june   due primarily to additional spending on the enhanced operating system project  checkfree epl sm enhanced portfolio lifecycle 
we expect our future margin to remain around the mid to upper teens level until completion of checkfree epl  which is currently scheduled for release and initial customer migration  in the second half of fiscal 
table of contents software segment information software revenue s june  change year ended growth in revenue on a year over year basis was mainly due to growth in license sales of our orm products  primarily contributed to our acquisition of accurate in april  and incremental professional services provided to implement several of our solutions to customers throughout the year 
our sales pipelines have steadily improved during fiscal while our first quarter sales are typically low  we are optimistic about the potential for continued sales growth in the coming fiscal year 
software operating income s june  change year ended our operating margin improved from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june  the fiscal operating margin was negatively impacted by a million charge due to a loss on a services customer with a large client 
most of our revenue growth came from relatively low margin implementation services and maintenance revenue resulting from our acquisition of accurate in april additionally  we experienced an increase in operating expenses in fiscal from the closing of our waterloo  ontario  canada facility  and the related increase in product implementation resources at our headquarters in norcross  georgia 
impact of discontinued operations m solutions revenue s june  change year ended m solutions operating income s june  change year ended in the quarter ended march   we divested the assets of m solutions  a component of investment services 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we report the results of operations from the divested business separately as earnings from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
m solutions historically provided modest revenue and operating income on an annual basis 

table of contents corporate segment information corporate operating loss s june  change year ended corporate results represent costs for legal  human resources  finance and various other unallocated overhead expenses 
we continue to leverage our infrastructure costs in the face of increasing revenues and despite the increase in acquisition related operations 
increases in corporate costs in fiscal were offset by reduced sarbanes oxley act section compliance costs as we leverage the documentation work completed in fiscal  the first year for the required certification of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
purchase accounting amortization s june  change year ended purchase accounting amortization represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from our various acquisitions from forward 
the decrease in purchase accounting amortization is due to intangible assets that have fully amortized since june   offset by the addition of identifiable intangible assets of million from our acquisition of accurate in april  million from our acquisition of ids in september  million from our acquisition of aphelion in october  and million from our acquisition of phonecharge in january the september expiration of the transpoint strategic agreements alone reduced intangible asset amortization by approximately million in the year ended june  sfas r options issued before july  s june  change year ended upon our adoption of sfas r  we recorded compensation costs relating to the vesting of all stock options that remained unvested as of july   as well as for all new stock option grants after our adoption date 
the compensation cost to be recorded is based on the fair value at the grant date 
the amounts recorded during the year ended june   represent equity based compensation expense relating to the vesting of options that were unvested as of july   but were granted before the implementation of our current compensation philosophy on july   which significantly reduces overall participation and focuses on restricted stock awards with limited stock option grants 
as we adopted sfas r effective the beginning of fiscal  there was no such expense recorded during our fiscal year 
impact of discontinued operations s june  change year ended in the quarter ended march   we divested of m solutions  a component of our investment services segment 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we report the results of operations from the divested business separately as earnings from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we divested of the business in early february  and therefore  the year ended june   reflects slightly more than seven months of operations versus a full twelve months in the year ended june

since june   full service revenue per transaction declined from to as of june  payment services revenue has increased substantially  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in addition to growth in transactions processed from our existing customer base  the primary driver of the increase in revenue had been our acquisition of aps on june  this walk in payment business contributed significant transaction volume at a per transaction rate substantially higher than our core payment services business 
the addition of walk in payments can be seen clearly in the increase in both revenue and transactions processed beginning in the quarter ended september   in the historical trends above

due primarily to processing efficiency improvement  we experienced a steady increase in net cash provided by operating activities over the past several years 
for the year ended june   we generated million of net cash provided by operating activities  despite our tax payments increasing million more than the amount we paid in fiscal year  including the tax on the gain on our sale of m solutions 
we expect net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million for our fiscal year ending june  due to the payout of annual incentive bonuses and commissions  we expect net cash from operating activities to be relatively low in the quarter ending september  considering our existing cash and invested asset balances  and expectations of net cash provided by operating activities in the near future  we believe 
table of contents we have sufficient cash to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the near term 
our board of directors has approved up to million for the purpose of repurchasing shares of our common stock through july   should we determine the time and price to be appropriate 
on april   we entered into a revolving credit facility that provides for up to million in revolving credit loans  swingline loans  and the issuance of letters of credit 
this credit facility replaces our previous facility of million 
unless terminated earlier  the credit facility expires on april  any borrowings will bear interest at certain rates based upon our then current ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda 
the credit facility also requires the payment of a commitment fee  expressed as a percentage per annum on any unused commitment because we have not drawn any funds against it as of june  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring us to meet financial ratios and contains operating covenants which  among other things  impose some limitations with respect to additional indebtedness  investments  dividends and prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  mergers and consolidations  liens and other matters customarily addressed in such agreements

while the timing of cash payments and collections will cause fluctuations from quarter to quarter and the level of capital expenditures could change  we expect to generate between million and million of free cash flow for the fiscal year ending june  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement assets and liabilities  less capital expenditures  plus data center reimbursements 
see use of non gaap financial information for further discussion of this measure 
on april   we also entered into a series of financing and leasing arrangements the agreements with a consortium of banks for the purpose of leasing up to two data centers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements  suntrust is required to purchase a fee simple interest in certain parcels of real property the properties specified by checkfree services corporation checkfree services  our wholly owned operating company  and checkfree services  as construction agent for suntrust  is required to construct data center facilities the facilities on the properties 
the funding for the acquisition of the properties and the construction of the facilities will be provided by suntrust and certain financial institutions 
the aggregate limit on the funding to be provided by suntrust and the financial institutions is million 
we have drawn million against this facility as of june  at an average interest rate of 
during construction and after completion of the facilities  suntrust will lease the properties and the facilities to checkfree services pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
checkfree services will make minimum lease payments beginning upon completion of construction that will vary based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread 
the lease agreements will expire on april   unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements 

table of contents upon expiration of the agreements  checkfree services must elect to i purchase the facilities and properties from suntrust for a defined amount  ii request a five year renewal of the lease agreements maximum of two such five year renewals provided for  subject to the approval and consent of suntrust and the lenders  or iii sell the facilities and properties as agent for suntrust  provided that certain conditions are satisfied the remarketing option 
if checkfree services chooses the remarketing option  various outcomes may occur under the agreements  but if the net cash proceeds of any sale are less than an amount equal to the aggregate sum of the outstanding amounts funded by suntrust and all other lenders  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loans  all unpaid fees owing to suntrust and any other lender under the operative documents  and all other amounts owing to suntrust and all other lenders under the lease agreements the outstanding amounts  checkfree services will be required to pay suntrust the difference between the sale proceeds and the outstanding amounts  but in no event more than approximately of the outstanding amounts

we anticipate that our cash flows from operations along with our line of credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy these obligations 
use of non gaap financial information we supplement our reporting of cash flow information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap by using free cash flow in this annual report on form k as a measure to evaluate our liquidity 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  exclusive of the net change in settlement accounts and less capital expenditures  plus data center reimbursements 
we believe free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors in 
table of contents understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance 
we also use free cash flow as a factor in determining long term incentive compensation for senior management 
we exclude the net change in settlement accounts from free cash flow because we believe this facilitates management s and investors ability to analyze operating cash flow trends 
in connection with our walk in payment business  our consolidated balance sheet reflects settlement assets and settlement obligations 
the settlement assets represent payment receipts in transit to us from agents  and the settlement obligations represent scheduled but unpaid payments due to billers 
balances in settlement accounts fluctuate daily based on deposit timing and payment transaction volume 
these timing differences are not reflective of our liquidity  and thus  we exclude the net change in settlement accounts from free cash flow 
as a technology company  we make significant capital expenditures in order to update our technology and to remain competitive 
our free cash flow reflects the amount of cash we generated that remains  after we have met those operational needs  for the evaluation and execution of strategic initiatives such as acquisitions  stock and or debt repurchases and other investing and financing activities  including servicing additional debt obligations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a credit facility to finance the construction of data centers 
amounts we spend to construct these data centers are included in our capital expenditures  but will be fully reimbursed by the credit facility 
the reimbursements from the credit facility are added to our free cash flow measure because these expenditures do not impact our overall liquidity 
the data center reimbursements line represents a change to our definition of free cash flow as of the quarter ended june  free cash flow does not solely represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures  as certain of our non discretionary obligations are also funded out of free cash flow 
these consist primarily of payments on capital leases and other long term commitments  if any  as reflected in the table entitled contractual obligations in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
our free cash flow for the years ended june  and  is calculated as follows in thousands year ended june  cash provided by operating activities excluding net change in settlement accounts less capital expenditures plus data center reimbursements free cash flow net cash used in investing activities for the years ended june  and  was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  our free cash flow should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with gaap 
further  our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

accounting for goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant goodwill balances 
as of june   the balance of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
in accordance with fas  we evaluate goodwill for impairment no less than annually by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
assumed growth rates ranged from to and varied by reporting unit based upon near and medium term growth opportunities 
the assumed weighted average cost of capital approximated to 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of goodwill as of june   none of which is considered impaired  based on recent impairment testing 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of april of each year 
no indicators of impairment were evident during our review for fiscal year intangible assets exclusive of goodwill 
we have recorded intangible assets that were initially recognized as a result of business combinations 
the intangible assets are amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate  for impairment  the carrying value of acquired intangible assets by comparing 
table of contents the carrying value to the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the intangible asset 
if an intangible asset is impaired  the asset is written down to fair value 
intangible assets are evaluated in light of actual results from operations and related cash flows to ensure that the carrying value of these intangible assets is recoverable 
significant changes in our results from operations could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of intangible assets  exclusive of goodwill  as of june  given the significance of intangibles  adverse changes to our operations could result in an impairment charge that could be material to the financial statements 
equity instruments issued to customers 
within our electronic commerce segment  from time to time  we have determined it appropriate to issue warrants to certain of our customers to provide an incentive for them to achieve mutually beneficial long term objectives 
these objectives can take the form of performance against long term growth targets  such as the number of the third party s customers that become active bill paying subscribers of our service or the number of bills distributed electronically to the third party s customers 
accounting standards for these types of warrants require us to record a charge when it becomes probable that the warrants will vest 
for milestone based warrants the amount of the charge would be the fair value of the portion of the warrants earned by the customer based on their progress towards achieving the milestone s required to vest in the warrants 
at each reporting date  we would determine the current fair value of the portion of the warrants previously earned and true up the charges previously recorded 
in addition  we would record a charge for the fair value of the additional portion of the warrants earned during that period  again based on the customer s progress towards the vesting milestones 
this would continue until the warrants vest  at which time a final fair value is determined and the charge is adjusted accordingly 
at the time we issued these warrants  accounting standards in place indicated that the charge for these type warrants be recorded as an expense 
since then  the eitf issued eitf this guidance became effective for financial statements issued after december   and is retroactively applied to existing equity instruments previously issued 
it requires that the charge for the fair value of these types of warrants be recorded against revenue up to the cumulative amount of revenue recognized for a customer instead of to expense as was previously the case 
management must use judgment in determining when the vesting of a warrant becomes probable 
as of june   we had five million unvested warrants outstanding that expire in october that could potentially result in a charge against our revenue that could be material to our financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes 
we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
the internal revenue service is currently conducting an audit of our income tax returns for tax years june  and these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record reserves for what we identify as probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved 
we have also established a valuation allowance for state and foreign loss carryforwards  as well as foreign credit carryforwards as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these items will not be realized 
the estimate of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with various tax filing positions 
to make these judgments  we make determinations about the likelihood that the specific taxing authority may challenge the tax deductions that we have taken on our tax return 
based on information about other tax settlements  we estimate amounts that we may settle with taxing authorities in order to conclude audits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
as of june   we had established tax reserves of million and a valuation allowance of million 
as of june   we have million of deferred income tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  million of which are recorded in the current asset section of our consolidated balance sheet  and million of which are recorded in the long term asset section of our consolidated balance sheet  and million of long term deferred tax liabilities in accordance with gaap 
while our current projections indicate we will be able to fully utilize our remaining deferred income tax benefits  should competitive pressures or other business risks result in a significant variance to our projected taxable income  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax asset balances 

table of contents investments 
a large portion of our investments is reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
changes in estimated future cash flows or an issuer s credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates 
fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  fixed maturity securities are subject to our review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  generally greater than six months  the reasons for the decline in value  whether it is a credit event or whether it is interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery in value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with our acquisitions of bluegill in april  heliograph in november and accurate in april  we now maintain multiple offices in the united kingdom  as well as offices in luxembourg and australia 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize pounds sterling as the functional currency for the united kingdom  the euro as the functional currency for luxembourg and the australian dollar as the functional currency for australia 
due to the relatively immaterial nature of the amounts involved  our economic exposure from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is not significant enough at this time to engage in a formal hedging program that uses various financial instruments to mitigate this risk 

table of contents while our international sales represented approximately five percent of our consolidated revenues for the year ended june   we market  sell and license our products throughout the world 
as a result  our future revenue could be somewhat affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our exposure to interest rate risk includes the yield we earn on invested cash  cash equivalents and investments and interest based revenue earned on products such as our abt product 
our outstanding lease obligations primarily carry fixed interest rates 
as part of processing certain types of transactions  we earn interest from the time money is collected from our customers until the time payment is made to merchants 
these revenues  which are generated from trust account balances not included in our consolidated balance sheet  are included in processing and servicing revenue 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the variability of cash flows related to this interest rate sensitive portion of processing and servicing revenue 
accordingly  we enter into interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our interest rate sensitive revenue 
as of june   we entered into interest rate swap transactions totaling million 
the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges  and they are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the interest rate swaps and underlying interest rate sensitive revenue  fluctuations in the fair value of the swaps are generally offset by the changes resulting from the variability of cash flows from the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of derivatives by about  the decline in fair value of the swap would also result in a decrease in net cash inflows from our interest rate swaps 
our investment policy does not allow us to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a system of internal controls that includes policies and procedures covering the authorization  reporting and monitoring of derivative activity 
further  the policy allows us to enter into derivative contracts only with counter parties that meet certain credit rating and or financial stability criteria 
the counter parties to these contracts are major financial institutions  and we believe the risk of loss is remote
