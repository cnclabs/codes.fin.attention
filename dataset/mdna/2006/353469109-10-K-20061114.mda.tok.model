our fiscal year ends on august  and unless otherwise indicated  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  refers to the twelve month periods ended august    and key factors that influence our operating results include the number of organizations that are active customers  the number of people trained within those organizations  the sale of personal productivity tools including franklincovey planners  personal  binders  electronic planning devices  and other related products  the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients  which is significantly influenced by general economic conditions  and our ability to manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful training and products to our clients 
results of operations overview our operating results in fiscal reflected year over year improvement compared to fiscal despite a slight decrease in overall sales  due primarily to closed retail stores  we reported income from operations of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal for the fiscal year ended august   we reported net income before preferred dividends of million  compared to million in fiscal our fiscal net income includes the reversal of valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets that favorably impacted our reported income taxes by million 
the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  were as follows sales performance our consolidated sales decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sales was due to an million decline in product sales that was primarily the result of closed retail stores 
our training and consulting services sales increased by million compared to fiscal  which was attributable to improvements in both domestic and international delivery channels 
the improvement in training and consulting services sales was primarily due to increased sales of our recently refreshed the habits of highly effective people training courses 
decreased operating costs our operating costs decreased by million compared to fiscal reduced operating expenses were due to a million reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million decline in amortization expense 
consistent with prior years  we continue to seek for and implement strategies that will enable us to reduce our operating costs in order to improve our profitability 
income tax benefit due to improved operating performance and the expected availability of future taxable amounts  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain deferred income tax assets would be realized 
as a result  we reversed the valuation allowances on those domestic net deferred income tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reversal of the valuation allowances had a million favorable impact on our reported fiscal income taxes 
preferred stock redemptions during fiscal  we redeemed million  or million shares  of our series a preferred stock 
since the fiscal preferred stock recapitalization  we have redeemed a total of million  or million shares  of our preferred stock 
these preferred stock redemptions have reduced our dividend obligation by million per year 
although we achieved improved financial results in fiscal and recognized improvements in other financial trends  we have not yet attained our targeted business model and we are therefore continuing our efforts to increase sales  improve gross margins  and reduce operating costs in order to achieve consistently profitable operations in future periods 
further details regarding our operating results and liquidity are provided throughout the following management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income loss before income taxes in our consolidated income statements year ended august  product sales training and consulting services sales total sales product cost of sales training and consulting services cost of sales total cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense recovery from legal settlement gain on disposal of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes segment review we have two reporting segments the consumer solutions business unit csbu and the organizational solutions business unit osbu 
the following is a brief description of these segments and their primary operating activities 
consumer solutions business unit this business unit is primarily focused on sales to individual customers and includes the results of the company s retail stores  consumer direct includes catalog  ecommerce  and public seminar training operations  wholesale  and other related distribution channels  including government sales  and office superstores 
the csbu results of operations also include the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic planning devices  virtually any component of the company s leadership and productivity solutions can be purchased through csbu channels 
organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of productivity  leadership  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales performance  and effective communication training solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of our domestic sales force as well as our international operations 
our international operations include the financial results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
the following table sets forth sales data by category and for our operating segments for the periods indicated 
for further information regarding our reporting segments and geographic information  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k in thousands 
year ended august  percent change from prior year percent change from prior year sales by category products training and consulting services consumer solutions business unit retail stores consumer direct wholesale other csbu organizational solutions business unit domestic international total net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales our overall product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  software  handheld electronic planning devices  and publishing  which are primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million compared to fiscal the decline in overall product sales was primarily due to decreased retail store sales resulting from store closures that occurred during fiscal and the following is a description of sales performance in our csbu delivery channels during the year ended august  retail sales the decline in retail sales was primarily due to store closures  which had a million unfavorable impact on our retail store sales in fiscal our retail stores also sold million less technology and specialty products when compared to the prior year  primarily due to declining demand for electronic handheld planning products 
although store closures and reduced technology and specialty product sales caused total retail sales to decline compared to the prior year  we recognized a percent improvement in year over year comparable store stores which were open during the comparable periods sales in fiscal as sales of core products eg planners  binders  totes  and accessories increased compared to the prior year 
at august   we were operating domestic retail locations compared to locations at august  consumer direct sales through our consumer direct segment ecommerce  catalog  and public seminars increased primarily due to increased public seminar sales and increased sales of core products 
increased public seminar sales was the result of additional seminars held during fiscal and an increase in the number of participants attending these programs 
wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  were essentially flat compared to the prior year 
other csbu sales other csbu sales primarily consist of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the increase in other csbu sales was primarily attributable to increased sublease income from additional sublease contracts obtained during fiscal we have subleased a substantial portion of our corporate headquarters in salt lake city  utah and have recognized million of sublease revenue during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal training and consulting services sales we offer a variety of training and consulting services and related products that are focused on assisting individuals and organizations to become measurably more effective 
our training and consulting services include programs in productivity  leadership  strategy execution  sales force performance  and effective communications that are delivered both domestically and internationally through the osbu 
our overall training and consulting service sales totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to the prior year 
the improvement in training sales was reflected in both domestic and international training program and consulting sales 
our domestic sales performance improved in nearly all sales regions and was primarily attributable to increased sales of the refreshed the habits of highly effective people training course and the expansion of our sales force 
domestic sales also increased million as a result of additional symposium conferences that were held during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal these sales increases were partially offset by reduced sales force performance training  due to decreased demand in fiscal  and decreased sales from seminars presented by dr 
stephen r 
covey 
in fiscal  dr 
covey presented more seminars to coincide with the publication of his new book  the th habit 
international sales improved by million  primarily due to increased sales at our directly owned operations in japan  canada  and brazil  as well as increased licensee royalty revenues 
international sales improvements from these sources were partially offset by decreased sales in the united kingdom and mexico  unfavorable currency translation rates  and the correction of misstatements at our mexico subsidiary 
during fiscal  certain foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  weakened against the united states dollar  which had an unfavorable impact on reported sales 
the unfavorable impact of currency translation on reported international sales totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that our mexico subsidiary misstated its financial results in prior periods by recording improper sales transactions and not recording all operating expenses in proper periods 
we determined that the misstatements occurred during fiscal through fiscal in various amounts 
the correction of these misstatements  which primarily occurred in prior fiscal years  resulted in a million decrease in international sales in fiscal gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of goods sold or the cost of services provided 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
we record the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of our consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross profit may not be comparable with the gross profit of other retailers that include similar costs in their cost of sales 
our overall gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  improved to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily attributable to improved margins on product sales  which was partially offset by declining margins on our training and consulting sales 
our gross margin on product sales improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in product sales gross margin was primarily due to improved inventory management processes  which reduced obsolescence  scrap  and other related charges  and changes in our product mix as sales of lower margin technology and specialty products continued to decline while sales of higher margin core products increased compared to the prior year 
our overall gross margin on training and consulting services declined to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease in training and consulting services gross margin was primarily attributable to increased sales of lower margin symposium conferences and decreased sales of higher margin sales performance training products during fiscal these unfavorable gross margin items were partially offset by decreased sales of lower margin seminars presented by dr 
covey in the fiscal year 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our consolidated selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to reduced retail store costs resulting from operating fewer stores  reductions in executive severance costs  reduced stock based compensation costs  and the favorable results of initiatives to reduce overall operating costs 
our retail store sg a expenses decreased million primarily due to store closures that occurred during fiscal and in prior periods refer to discussion below 
during fiscal we incurred and expensed million of severance costs to our former general counsel and we did not incur any similar executive severance charges in fiscal our stock based compensation costs declined million due to a fully vested stock award granted to the ceo and accelerated vesting on unvested stock awards during fiscal the overall decrease in stock based compensation cost was partially offset by expense related to our long term incentive plan see discussion below during fiscal in addition to these decreases  we continue to implement strategies designed to reduce our overall operating costs 
the favorable impact of these efforts has resulted in reduced sg a expenses in many areas of the company during the fiscal year ended august  these cost reductions were partially offset by additional spending on growth initiatives see discussion below that resulted in increased travel expenses resulting from further employee training and sales leadership events  which totaled million  and increased osbu associate costs totaling million resulting primarily from hiring additional sales personnel 
we also corrected misstated operating expenses at our mexico subsidiary  which had a million unfavorable impact on our sg a expenses in fiscal during fiscal  we have invested in various initiatives intended to grow our business in future periods 
these initiatives included hiring additional sales people  increased advertising and marketing programs  additional curriculum and product development  and increased spending on sales effectiveness training 
due to the time necessary to implement these growth strategies  including training new sales personnel and effectively rolling out new training offerings and products  these growth initiatives did not add material benefits to our fiscal operating results 
however  we believe that these investments in additional sales personnel  increased marketing  and new consulting  training  and product offerings may increase our sales and improve our operating performance in future periods 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  including previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we closed stores during fiscal the costs associated with closing retail stores are typically comprised of charges related to vacating the premises  which may include a provision for the remaining term on the lease  and severance and other personnel costs 
these store closure costs totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  when we closed retail locations 
store closure costs are expensed as incurred and were included as a component of our sg a expense 
based upon our continuing analyses of retail store performance  we may close additional retail stores and may continue to incur costs associated with closing these stores in future periods 
during fiscal our shareholders approved a long term incentive plan ltip that permits the grant of annual unvested share awards of common stock to certain employees 
these ltip share awards granted during fiscal cliff vest on august   which is the completion of a three year performance period 
the number of shares that are finally awarded to participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of a combination of performance objectives related to sales growth and operating income during the three year performance period 
the award was initially for  shares target award of common stock 
the award shares were valued at per share  and the corresponding initial compensation cost totaled million 
however  the number of shares that will ultimately vest under the ltip will vary depending on whether the performance criteria are met or exceeded 
the award will be reviewed quarterly and the value may be adjusted  depending on the performance of the company compared to the award criteria 
based upon fiscal financial performance and estimated performance through the remaining service period  the number of performance awards granted during fiscal was reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal to  shares  which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to our fiscal operating results of million 
the compensation cost of the award is being expensed over the three year service period of the award and increased our stock based compensation cost in fiscal by million 
the continued amortization of the fiscal award and any future ltip grants may increase our sg a expense during the vesting period 
on september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
although the additional compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r was immaterial to our fiscal year ended august   our operating expenses may be unfavorably affected in future periods if we grant additional stock options or participation in our employee stock purchase program increases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
based upon current capital spending levels  we do not expect depreciation expense to continue to decline during fiscal to the same extent that it declined in fiscal when compared to prior periods 
amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decline was due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets during fiscal and in prior periods 
during fiscal  we reduced the remaining estimated useful life of customer lists acquired in the merger with the covey leadership center based upon expected future sales from these customers 
this change in accounting estimate increased our amortization expense in fiscal by million 
we expect intangible asset amortization expense to total million in fiscal other income and expense items interest income our interest income increased million primarily due to increased interest rates on our interest bearing cash accounts 
interest expense our interest expense increased million primarily due to the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and the resulting interest component of the financing obligation in our lease payments to the landlord 
legal settlement in fiscal  we filed legal action against world marketing alliance  inc  a georgia corporation wma  and world financial group  inc  a delaware corporation and purchaser of substantially all assets of wma  for breach of contract 
the case proceeded to trial and the jury rendered a verdict in our favor and against wma for the entire unpaid contract amount of approximately million 
in addition to the verdict  we recovered legal fees totaling million and pre and post judgment interest of million from wma 
we received payment in cash from wma for the total verdict amount  including legal fees and interest 
however  shortly after paying the verdict amount  wma appealed the jury decision to the th circuit court of appeals and we recorded receipt of the verdict amount plus legal fees and interest with a corresponding increase to accrued liabilities and deferred the gain until the case was finally resolved 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with wma 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  wma agreed to dismiss its appeal 
as a result of this settlement agreement and dismissal of wma s appeal  we recorded a million gain from the legal settlement 
income taxes the increase in our income tax benefit in fiscal was due to the reversal of the majority of our valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets  which totaled million 
the fiscal income tax benefit was partially offset by taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees and taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions by our profitable directly owned foreign operations 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and was partially offset by taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees and taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions resulting from profitable foreign operations 
our effective tax rate has been unusual in recent years  including fiscal  due to the effect of operating losses and changes in valuation allowances 
absent extraordinary  unforeseen events  we expect our effective income tax rate for fiscal and future years to be approximately percent  primarily due to the effect of permanent book versus tax differences and income from foreign licensees 
however  the utilization of domestic loss carryforwards will minimize cash outflows related to domestic income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales our overall product sales  which are primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million compared to fiscal the decline in product sales was primarily due to decreased sales in our retail and wholesale delivery channels  with the majority of the decline in product sales occurring in our first quarter of fiscal the following is a description of sales performance in our csbu delivery channels during the fiscal retail sales the decline in retail sales was due to the impact of fewer stores  which represented million of the total million decline  and reduced technology and spacialty product sales  which totaled million 
during fiscal  we closed retail store locations and we closed additional stores during fiscal at august   we were operating retail stores compared to stores at august  overall product sales trends were reflected in a four percent decline in year over year comparable store sales 
declining technology and specialty product sales were partially offset by increased core product sales during fiscal consumer direct sales through our consumer direct channels ecommerce  catalog  and public seminars increased primarily due to increased public seminar sales  which totaled million  and increased core product sales 
wholesale sales sales through our wholesale channel  which includes sales to office superstores and other retail chains  decreased primarily due to a shift from contract stationer revenue channels to royalty based retail channels 
as a result of this change our sales decreased  but our gross margin contribution through this channel remained consistent with the prior year 
other csbu sales other csbu sales primarily consist of domestic printing and publishing sales and building sublease revenues 
the increase in other csbu sales was primarily attributable to increased sublease income 
we have subleased a substantial portion of our corporate headquarters in salt lake city  utah and have recognized million of sublease revenue during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal training and consulting services sales our overall training and consulting service sales increased by million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the improvement in training sales was reflected in both domestic and international training program and consulting sales 
our domestic sales performance improved in nearly all sales regions and was primarily attributable to increased client facilitated sales of the enhanced the habits of highly effective people training course  increased sales performance group sales  and improved sales of our the disciplines of leadership and xq offerings 
international sales improved by million  or percent primarily due to increased sales in japan  mexico  brazil  the united kingdom  increased licensee royalty revenues  and the translation of foreign sales amounts as foreign currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during much of fiscal the favorable impact of currency translation on reported international revenues totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  these increases were partially offset by decreased sales performance at our canadian operations 
gross profit our overall gross margin improved to percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal this overall gross margin improvement is consistent with quarterly gross margin trends during fiscal and was primarily due to increased training and consulting sales as a percent of total sales  favorable product mix changes  lower product costs  and improved margins on our training and consulting service sales 
training and consulting service sales  which typically have higher gross margins than our product sales  increased to percent of total sales during fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
our gross margin on product sales improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement was primarily due to a favorable shift in our product mix as sales of higher margin paper products and binders increased as a percent of total sales  while sales of lower margin technology and specialty products continued to decline 
additionally  the overall margin on paper and binder sales has improved through focused cost reduction efforts  and improved inventory management 
training and related consulting services gross margin  as a percent of sales for these services  improved to percent compared to percent in fiscal the improvement in our training and consulting services gross margin was primarily due to a continued shift in training sales mix toward higher margin courses and offerings  reduced costs for training materials  such as participant manuals and related items  and overall lower costs associated with training sales 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million and improved as a percent of sales to percent  compared to percent in fiscal declining sg a expenses were the direct result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs and is consistent with operating expense trends during the previous two fiscal years 
our cost reduction efforts have included retail store closures  headcount reductions  consolidation of corporate office space  and other measures designed to focus our resources on critical activities and projects 
these efforts were partially offset by increased commission expenses related to increased training sales  severance costs associated with a former executive officer  expenses related to the cancellation of the ceo s compensation agreement  additional costs associated with the preferred stock recapitalization  investments in new products  and costs of hiring new sales force personnel 
the primary effects of our cost cutting initiatives were reflected in reduced rent and utilities expenses of million and reductions in other sg a expenses  such as outsourcing and development costs  that totaled million compared to the prior year 
we also reduced our store closure costs by million refer to discussion below as many of the leases on stores that were closed expired during fiscal and did not require additional costs to exit the leases 
these improvements were partially offset by million of increased associate costs and million of additional advertising and promotion spending 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  including previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we closed stores during fiscal retail store closure costs totaled million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  when we closed store locations 
during fiscal  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure our operations  which included an initiative to formally exit leased office space located in provo  utah 
during fiscal  we exercised an option  available under our master lease agreement  to purchase  and simultaneously sell  the office facility to the current tenant 
the negotiated purchase price with the landlord was million and the tenant agreed to purchase the property for million 
these prices were within the range of estimated fair values of the buildings as determined by an independent appraisal obtained by the company 
we paid the difference between the sale and purchase prices  plus other closing costs  which were included as a component of the restructuring plan accrual 
after completion of the sale transaction  the remaining fiscal restructuring costs  which totaled million  were credited to sg a expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain property and equipment balances  primarily computer software and hardware  and the effects of significantly reduced capital expenditures during preceding fiscal years 
interest income and interest expense interest income our interest income increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to increased cash balances and higher interest rates on our interest bearing cash accounts 
interest expense our interest expense increased million primarily due to the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and the resulting interest component of our lease payments to the landlord 
we are accounting for the lease on the corporate facility as a financing obligation  which is accounted for similar to long term debt 
gain on disposal of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary during fiscal  we purchased approximately percent of the capital stock subsequently diluted to approximately percent ownership of agilix labs  inc agilix  for cash payments totaling million 
agilix is a development stage enterprise that develops software applications  including the majority of our software applications that are available for sale to external customers 
although we continue to sell software developed by agilix  uncertainties in agilix s business plan developed during our fiscal quarter ended march  and their potential adverse effects on agilix s operations and future cash flows were significant 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that our ability to recover the investment in agilix was remote 
accordingly  we impaired and expensed our remaining investment in agilix of million during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended may   certain affiliates of agilix purchased the shares of capital stock held by us for million in cash  which was reported as a gain on disposal of an investment in unconsolidated subsidiary 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal resulted primarily from reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
this tax benefit was partially offset by taxes payable by foreign affiliates and taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
the income tax provision for fiscal was primarily attributable to taxes payable by foreign affiliates and taxes withheld on royalties from foreign licensees 
these foreign taxes were partially offset by the reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters 
as of august  and  given our recent history of significant operating losses  we had provided a valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
as of august  and  we had net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
our foreign deferred tax assets of million and million at august  and primarily relate to our operations in japan 
the net domestic deferred tax liability of million at august  and the million deferred liability at august  primarily relate to the step up of indefinite lived intangibles 
loss on recapitalization of preferred stock we completed our preferred stock recapitalization during the quarter ended may  due to the significant modifications to our preferred stock  we determined that our previously outstanding preferred stock was replaced with new classes of preferred stock and common stock warrants 
as a result  the new preferred stock was recorded at its fair value on the date of modification  which was determined to be equal to the liquidation preference of per share 
the difference between the aggregate fair value of the consideration given the new series a preferred stock and the common stock warrants and the carrying value of the previously existing series a preferred stock  which totaled million  was reported as a loss on recapitalization of preferred stock  which decreased net income available to common shareholders in the quarter ended may  subsequent to may   we used million of the proceeds from the june sale of our corporate headquarters facility to redeem shares of preferred stock under terms of the recapitalization plan 
quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for fiscal and fiscal the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
quarterly financial information year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income preferred stock dividends income available to common shareholders earnings loss per share available to common shareholders basic diluted year ended august  november february may august in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation amortization income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income loss preferred stock dividends loss on recapitalization of preferred stock income loss attributable to common shareholders basic and diluted loss per share attributable to common shareholders our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklincovey planners on a calendar year basis 
domestic training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed valuation allowances on certain deferred income tax assets which had a million favorable impact on our net income and net income available to common shareholders for that period 
during the quarter ended may   we determined that our mexico subsidiary had misstated its financial results in prior periods by recording improper sales transactions and not recording all operating expenses in proper periods 
we determined that the misstatements occurred during fiscal through fiscal in various amounts 
the audit committee engaged an independent legal firm to investigate the misstatements and they concluded that such misstatements were intentional 
the company determined that the impact of these misstatements was immaterial to previously issued financial statements and we recorded a million decrease to international sales and a million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses during the quarter ended may  to correct these misstatements 
we have taken actions as recommended by the investigators to prevent future misstatements  which include enhancements to internal control over foreign operations 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the timing of large corporate orders  the elimination of unprofitable products or training services  and the closure of retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  line of credit financing  long term borrowings  asset sales  and the issuance of preferred and common stock 
we currently rely primarily upon cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital levels 
at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  our net working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased to million at august  compared to million at august   primarily due to reduced cash and cash equivalents 
the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  cash flows from operating activities during fiscal our net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in fiscal our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our cash flows from operating activities were unfavorably affected by decreased sales compared to fiscal  although we recognized cash flow improvements from operating activities through reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses and corresponding reduced cash payments for costs and expenses related to generating revenues  which was reflected by improved income from operations 
our cash flows generated from improved operating results was offset by cash used for working capital items 
during fiscal  our primary uses of cash for operating activities were related to reducing accrued liability and accounts payable balances  payment of income taxes in jurisdictions where we were unable to utilize existing loss carryforwards  and the impact of increased accounts receivable that were primarily the result of increased sales in our osbu during the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that efforts to optimize working capital balances combined with existing and planned efforts to increase sales  including sales of new products and services  and cost cutting initiatives  will improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts is dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures net cash used for investing activities totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  our primary uses of investing cash were the purchases of property and equipment totaling million and million spent in curriculum development 
property and equipment purchases consisted primarily of computer hardware  software  and leasehold improvements for subleased areas of our corporate campus and in certain of our retail stores 
during fiscal  we invested in curriculum development primarily related to new leadership and strategy execution offerings 
during fiscal  we expect to spend million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
the increase in capital spending on property and equipment is primarily due to the purchase of new printing presses and equipment in connection with the reconfiguration of our printing operations 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million 
our primary uses of cash for financing activities were redemptions of preferred stock totaling million  purchases of common stock totaling million  preferred dividend payments totaling million  and principal payments on our long term debt and financing arrangement totaling million 
since we recapitalized our preferred stock in fiscal  we have redeemed million  or million shares  of our outstanding preferred stock 
these redemptions have reduced our preferred dividend obligation and corresponding financing cash outflows by million per year 
we anticipate making additional preferred stock redemptions under the terms of our recapitalization plan in future periods 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of payments to eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  payments on a financing obligation resulting from the sale of our corporate campus  minimum rent payments for retail store and sales office space  cash payments for series a preferred stock dividends  mortgage payments on certain buildings and property  cash payments for new printing services equipment  short term purchase obligations for inventory items  and monitoring fees paid to a series a preferred stock investor 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services required payments on corporate campus financing obligation minimum operating lease payments preferred stock dividend payments debt payments contractual computer hardware purchases payments for new printing services equipment purchase obligations monitoring fees paid to a preferred stock investor total expected contractual obligation payments amount reflects million of outstanding preferred stock 
the amount of cash dividends and monitoring fees that we are obligated to pay will decline as shares of preferred stock are redeemed 
the company s variable rate debt payments include interest payments at  which was the applicable interest rate at september  we are contractually obligated by our eds outsourcing agreement to purchase the necessary computer hardware to keep such equipment up to current specifications 
amounts shown are estimated capital purchases of computer hardward under terms of the eds outsourcing agreement and its amendments 
in august  we signed contracts to purchase new printing equipment for million in cash as part of a plan to reconfigure our printing services operation 
the payments are due at specified times during fiscal that coincide with the installation and successful operation of the new equipment 
other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities on the condition that we can continue to improve our cash flows generated from operating activities  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  redemptions of preferred stock  purchases of our common stock  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources products we sell planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that are primarily sold through our csbu channels 
training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in strategic execution  leadership  productivity  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
these training programs and services are primarily sold through our osbu channels 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sale transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  sales arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the sales contract meet the following criteria the delivered training or product has value to the client on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
if the fair value of all undelivered elements exits  but fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total contract consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for the company s existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products and support to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the majority of the company s software sales have elements  including a license and post contract customer support pcs 
currently the company does not have vsoe for either the license or support elements of its software sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred until the only undelivered element is pcs and the total arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the support period 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a directly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate the company s content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell the company s training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of the licensee s sales 
the company recognizes royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to the company from the licensee 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation effective september   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods financial results 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after september  and prior to but not yet vested as of september   in accordance with sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
 and accordingly  we generally recognized compensation expense from stock options only when we granted options with an exercise price below the market price on the date of grant or made modifications to stock option terms which increased the fair value of the award 
during fiscal  we granted performance based compensation awards to certain employees in a board of director approved long term incentive plan ltip 
these performance based share awards grant each participant the right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based upon the achievement of specified financial goals at the end of a predetermined performance period 
the ltip awards granted during fiscal cliff vest on august   which is the completion of a three year performance period 
the number of shares that are finally awarded to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of a combination of performance objectives related to sales growth fiscal sales compared to fiscal sales and cumulative operating income during the performance period 
due to the variable number of shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate the ltip on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon financial results of the company as compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are based upon estimated future performance and are made on a cumulative basis at the date of adjustment based upon the probable number of shares to be awarded 
actual results could differ from estimates made during the service  or vesting  period 
the compensation committee initially granted awards for  shares target award of common stock and the number of shares finally awarded will range from zero shares  if a minimum level of performance is not achieved  to percent of the target award  if specifically defined performance criteria is achieved during the three year performance period 
the minimum sales growth necessary for participants to receive any shares under the ltip is percent and the minimum cumulative operating income is million 
the percentage of target shares awarded is based upon the combination of these factors as shown below sales growth percent of target shares awarded cumulative operating income millions based upon fiscal financial performance and estimated performance through the remaining service period  the number of performance awards granted during fiscal was reduced at august  to  shares  which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to our fiscal operating results of million 
the compensation cost of the ltip grant was million in fiscal and the total compensation cost of the ltip will be equal to the number of shares finally issued multiplied by per share  which was the fair value of the common shares determined at the grant date 
we estimate the value of our stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
however  the company did not grant any stock options in fiscal years or and at august  the remaining cost associated with our unvested stock options was insignificant 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances past due over days  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  handheld electronic devices  stationery  training products  and other accessories 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we make judgments regarding future demand requirements and compare these assessments with current and committed inventory levels 
inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the osbu and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars  international licensee royalties  and related products 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
based upon our fiscal evaluation  our trade name related revenues and licensee royalties would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair the covey trade name 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
the evaluation of long lived assets requires us to use estimates of future cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes the company regularly evaluates united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
the tax benefits of tax exposure items are not recognized in the provision for income taxes unless it is probable that the benefits will be sustained  without regard to the likelihood of tax examination 
a tax exposure reserve represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the tax exposure reserve is classified as a component of the current income taxes payable account 
the company adds interest and penalties  if applicable  each period to the reserve which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
the company recognizes the benefits of the tax exposure items in the financial statements  that is  the reserve is reversed  when it becomes probable that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  the company considers all available positive evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence will not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for internal revenue service audits  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
the company continually assesses the need for valuation allowances against its deferred income tax assets  considering recent profitability  known trends and events  and expected future transactions 
for several years prior to the year ended august   our history of significant operating losses precluded us from demonstrating that it was more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards would be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on the majority of our deferred income tax assets 
in fiscal we reversed the majority of these valuation allowances 
due to improved operating performance  business models  and expectations regarding future taxable income  the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits of domestic operating loss carryforwards  together with the benefits of other deferred income tax assets will be realized 
thus  we reversed the valuation allowances on certain of our domestic deferred income tax assets  except for million related to foreign tax credits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments the company is exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency related issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts do not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expire on a quarterly basis  are recognized currently and are used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated income statements and had the following net impact on the periods indicated in thousands year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net gain loss on foreign exchange contracts at august   the fair value of these contracts  which was determined using the estimated amount at which contracts could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 
the notional amounts of our foreign currency sell contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting were as follows at august  in thousands contract description notional amount in foreign currency notional amount in us dollars japanese yen australian dollars mexican pesos net investment hedges during fiscal and  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts that were designed to manage foreign currency risks related to the value of our net investment in directly owned operations located in canada  japan  and the united kingdom 
these three offices comprise the majority of our net investment in foreign operations 
these foreign currency forward instruments qualified for hedge accounting and corresponding gains and losses were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal and  we recognized the following net losses on our net investment hedging contracts in thousands year ended august  losses on net investment hedge contracts gains on net investment hedge contracts net losses on investment hedge contracts as of august   we had settled our net investment hedge contracts and we did not utilize any net investment hedge contracts in fiscal however  we may continue to utilize net investment hedge contracts in future periods as a component of our overall foreign currency risk strategy 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in united states interest rates primarily as a result of the cash and cash equivalents that we hold 
at august   our debt balances consist of a financing obligation from the june sale of the corporate campus and one variable rate mortgage on certain of our buildings and property located in canada 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a lease arrangement with an interest rate of percent 
our variable rate mortgage has interest charged at the canadian prime rate plus one percent percent at august  and requires payments through january a one percent increase in the interest rate on our canadian mortgage would increase our total interest expense by million over the term of the mortgage 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
