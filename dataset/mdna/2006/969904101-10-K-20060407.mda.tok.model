in williams sonoma home  the increased catalog circulation and the opening of three new prototype stores in september and october including an  square foot flagship store in los angeles drove these results 
in addition  throughout the year  we saw a positive consumer response to our expanded merchandise assortment  with particular strength in furniture and bedding 
in january  we decided to transition the merchandising strategies of our hold everything brand into our other existing brands by the end of fiscal in connection with this transition  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal these costs primarily included the initial asset impairment and lease termination costs associated with the shutdown of the hold everything retail stores  the asset impairment of the e commerce website  and the write down of impaired merchandise inventories 
of this pre tax charge  approximately  is included in cost of goods sold and approximately  is included in selling  general  and administrative expenses

on our weeks of supply inventory management initiative  we made gradual progress throughout the year in optimizing the flow of our merchandise through the supply chain 
we improved our order fulfillment rates and reduced customer back orders 
the full benefit of this initiative  however  will not be realized until we have fully implemented our new inventory management system 
fiscal in fiscal  in an effort to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to focus on our long term strategic initiatives of driving profitable top line sales growth and increasing our pre tax operating margin

comparable stores exclude new retail concepts until such time as we believe that comparable store results in those concepts are meaningful to evaluating the performance of the retail strategy 
for fiscal  our total comparable store sales exclude the west elm concept  which  at year end  had only four stores operating for more than one year 
one west elm store was excluded in fiscal by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a history of being open for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes store remodelings  expansions and closings 
percentages represent changes in comparable store sales versus the same period in the prior year 
percent increase decrease in comparable store sales fiscal fiscal fiscal williams sonoma pottery barn pottery barn kids hold everything outlets total various factors affect comparable store sales  including the number  size and location of stores we open  close  remodel or expand in any period  the general retail sales environment  consumer preferences and buying trends

among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

table of contents may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications

consolidation of memphis based distribution facilities our memphis based distribution facilities include an operating lease entered into in july for a distribution facility in memphis  tennessee

howard lester  james a 
mcmahan and two unrelated parties

as of february   the company adopted fin r  which requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities under fin r due to their related party relationship and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities were consolidated by us as of february  as of january   the consolidation resulted in increases to our consolidated balance sheet of  in assets primarily buildings   in debt  and  in other long term liabilities 
consolidation of these partnerships did not have an impact on our net income 
however  the interest expense associated with the partnerships debt  shown as occupancy expense in fiscal  is now recorded as interest expense

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and specific identification 
we generally reserve  based on inventory aging reports  for of the cost of all inventory between one and two years old and of the cost of all inventory over two years old 
if actual obsolescence is different from our estimate  we will adjust our provision accordingly 
specific reserves are also recorded in the event the cost of the inventory exceeds the fair market value 
in addition  on a monthly basis  we estimate a reserve for expected shrinkage at the concept and channel level based on historical shrinkage factors and our current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  off site storage locations  and our third party transportation providers 
prepaid catalog expenses prepaid catalog expenses consist of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the decision to close  relocate  remodel or expand a store prior to the end of its lease term can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life of the long lived assets 
for any store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
however  most store closures occur upon the lease expiration 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all 
table of contents stores for which current cash flows from operations are negative  or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term typically to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis 
reserves for self insurance liabilities are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns  net of cost of goods sold  are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and awards granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
no 
table of contents compensation expense has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for stock options  as we grant all stock options with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant  however  stock compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated financial statements for restricted stock unit awards 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  however  requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share as if we had adopted the fair value method 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models 
these models require subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which affect the calculated values 
our calculations are based on a single option valuation approach  and forfeitures are recognized as they occur 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r will require us to measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
we expect to adopt this statement using the modified prospective application transition method beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we anticipate the adoption of this statement to result in a reduction to our diluted earnings per share of approximately for fiscal in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires us  beginning on january   to expense all rental costs associated with our operating leases that are incurred during a construction period 
prior to this date  rental costs incurred during the construction period were capitalized until the store opening date 
we anticipate the adoption of this staff position to result in a reduction to our diluted earnings per share of approximately for fiscal in september  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination  which requires us to amortize leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after the beginning of a lease term over the shorter of the useful life of the assets  or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assumed at the date the leasehold improvement is purchased 
this eitf did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our credit facility  industrial development bond and the bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of january   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of january   any currency risks related to these transactions were not significant to us 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
as of january   we have retail stores in canada  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as necessary  we have utilized day foreign currency contracts to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with intercompany assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary 
these contracts are accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market and recognizing any gain or loss in selling  general and administrative expenses in each reporting period 
we did not enter into any new foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal any gain or loss associated with these types of contracts in prior years was not material to us
