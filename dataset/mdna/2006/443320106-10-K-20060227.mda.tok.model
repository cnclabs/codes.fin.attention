net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was million and related primarily to capital expenditures made to enhance our information system capabilities 
assuming the comtrak acquisition closes  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately to million in if the deal does not close  we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   was million 
uses of cash related to the purchase of million of treasury stock 
we generated cash from stock options being exercised of approximately million 
on march   we entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to million 
the interest rate ranges from libor plus to or prime plus 
the revolving line of credit expires on march  the financial covenants require a minimum net worth of million and a cash flow leverage ratio of not more than to the commitment fees charged on the unused line of credit are between and per annum 
in february  we amended the revolving credit agreement to provide for unsecured borrowing up to million 
no other terms of the credit agreement were amended 
our unused and available borrowings under our bank revolving line of credit at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants at december  we have standby letters of credit that expire from to as of december  our letters of credit were million 
in  we added  new containers to our psn fleet 
we financed these  containers with operating leases 
these arrangements are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations as of december  are minimum rental commitments 
minimum annual rental commitments  at december   under noncancellable operating leases  principally for real estate  containers and equipment are payable as follows in thousands and thereafter critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in certain circumstances  those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and estimates 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers after a review of each customer s credit history 
an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging  an assessment of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the current economic conditions 
to be more specific  we reserve every account balance that has aged over one year  certain customers in bankruptcy and account balances specifically identified as uncollectible 
in addition  we provide a reserve for accounts not specifically identified as uncollectible based upon historical trends that are updated routinely 
the allowance is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from management s estimates due to changes in future economic  industry or customer financial conditions 
recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with eitf  revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time 
further  we report revenue on a gross basis in accordance with the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we are the primary obligor and are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer 
the customer views us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service 
service requirements may include  for example  on time delivery  handling freight loss and damage claims  setting up appointments for pick up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit 
we have discretion in setting sales prices and as a result  our earnings vary 
in addition  we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers 
finally  we have credit risk for our receivables 
these three factors  discretion in setting prices  discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk  further support reporting revenue on the gross basis 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of  related to state tax net operating losses and other state credits for which valuation allowances have been established 
in the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future  a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we utilize a third party independent valuation firm to assist in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment testing 
these valuations are based on market capitalization  discounted cash flow analysis or a combination of both methodologies 
the assumptions used in the valuations include expectations regarding future operating performance  discount rates  control premiums and other factors which are subjective in nature 
actual cash flows from operations could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
should estimates differ materially from actual results  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
new pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as permitted by statement  prior to january  we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt statement r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
we expect the impact of the adoption of statement r to be between 
and 
per share 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flow and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million and million in and  respectively 
outlook  risks and uncertainties business combinations divestitures we believe that future acquisitions or dispositions that we make could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net income and our debt level 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire comtrak  inc the closing is subject to certain customary closing conditions and approvals 
hub will pay million in cash at closing  which is expected to occur during the first quarter of the purchase price will be subject to adjustment based on comtrak s working capital at closing 
in addition  the agreement provides for an earn out for and  consisting of two cash payments  each of which will not exceed million 
we expect this acquisition to increase revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  general and administrative expense  depreciation and also impact net income 
if we do not close this transaction or if comtrak s future results do not approximate their projections  our earnings could be negatively impacted 
on november   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  hub group distribution services  llc hgds  entered into the purchase option and right of first refusal agreement pursuant to which hgds granted an entity controlled by william j 
mckenna the exclusive option to purchase all or substantially all of the assets of hgds for a cash purchase price of million subject to adjustment on the closing date  plus the assumption of certain hgds liabilities 
mr 
mckenna agreed to serve as president of hgds effective december  mckenna s company may exercise the option during the period the option period commencing on november   and ending on the earlier to occur of i march   and ii the date on which mckenna s employment with hgds terminates  provided  however  that this period may be extended for up to days depending on the circumstances of the termination of mckenna s employment 
additionally  hgds granted mckenna s company a right of first refusal with respect to any acceptable third party offers that we or hgds receive during the option period for all or substantially all of the assets of hgds 
during the option period  we and hgds agreed that  except as required by law  we would not solicit or initiate discussions or negotiations with any person other than mckenna s company relating to the sale of hgds or its assets 
excluding the comtrak acquisition  financial results may be impacted by additional factors as discussed below 
revenue we believe that the performance of the railroads and a severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence our revenue growth rate 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry causing a service disruption  we believe our intermodal business would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be a significant service disruption  we expect that there may be some customers who would switch from using our intermodal service to other transportation services 
we expect that these customers may choose to continue to utilize other services even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence our growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new web based competitors  customer retention  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
our installation services business  hgds  is a project based business with significant customer concentration 
any decrease in the demand from these customers or our failure to secure new project business could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
gross margin we expect fluctuations in the gross margin as a percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in the core transportation business mix  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  fuel costs  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  accessorials  competition and accounting estimates 
unlike other service offerings  our distribution services are comprised of certain higher margin projects 
there can be no assurance these higher margin projects will continue in the future 
salaries and benefits we estimate that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between volume increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements  changes in our operating structure and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
general and administrative we believe there are several factors that could cause general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of our information systems and related platforms  we believe there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
other factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in insurance premiums and outside services expense 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment we estimate that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will remain relatively consistent in assuming we close the comtrak acquisition 
if we do not acquire comtrak  depreciation and amortization expense will likely decrease in impairment of property and equipment and goodwill on an ongoing basis  we assess the realizability of our assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  management estimates that the write down of specific assets could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense we estimate that interest income will likely decrease compared to since we have entered into an agreement to purchase comtrak 
other factors that could cause a change include  but are not limited to funding working capital needs  funding capital expenditures and buying back stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our bank line of credit which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through our regular operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
no derivative financial instruments are outstanding at december  we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce our total funding cost and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile
