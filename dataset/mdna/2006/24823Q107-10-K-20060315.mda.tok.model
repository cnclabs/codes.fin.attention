item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that harness the immune system to fight cancer 
our portfolio includes active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
the product candidates most advanced in development are active immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient s immune system for the treatment of cancer 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge sipuleucel t  an active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge and other product candidates we may develop 
we anticipate that we will not generate revenue from the sale of our potential commercial therapeutic products during the next year 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources  future equity offerings and with license fees and milestone payments received from our collaborators 
the timing and level of funding from our existing or future collaborations will fluctuate based upon the success of our research programs  our ability to meet milestones and receipt of approvals from government regulators 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of increased clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with operating our new jersey manufacturing facility 
in january  we announced the realignment of our resources to focus on achieving regulatory approvals for provenge as expeditiously as possible and to reduce operating costs 
the majority of our resources have now been deployed to complete the bla during and prepare for the commercialization of provenge 
we anticipate net cash utilized for operating and capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
in addition  clinical trial costs may grow at a faster rate compared to research and other preclinical expenses as we continue our ongoing clinical trials 
provenge sipuleucel t in september  we announced plans to submit a bla to the fda to market provenge 
this decision followed a pre bla meeting in which we reviewed safety and efficacy data with the fda from our two completed phase clinical trials  d and da 
in these discussions the fda agreed that the survival benefit observed in the d study in conjunction with the supportive data obtained from study da and the absence of significant toxicity in both studies is sufficient to serve as the clinical basis of a bla submission for provenge 
we anticipate submitting a bla for provenge to the fda in on a rolling basis 
we own commercialization rights for provenge worldwide 
provenge has fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of asymptomatic patients with metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer 
our first phase clinical trial of provenge  d  was a randomized double blind placebo controlled study in men with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer 
the trial was designed to measure a delay in time to disease progression 
time to the onset of disease related pain was a secondary endpoint that was to be evaluated in concert with the results from a second  identical companion trial  d after disease progression  placebo patients were given the option to receive salvage therapy of provenge on a separate open label study 
the protocols for both trials required patients to be followed for survival for three years after enrollment 
trial d approached  but did not meet  its primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant delay in time to disease progression in the overall patient population in the study 
the trial results did  however  identify a group of patients  those with tumors that had been classified as gleason score or less  who appeared to benefit most significantly by treatment with provenge compared to patients who received placebo 
gleason score is a common measure of the aggressiveness of a patient s tumor and ranges in score from to in these men  provenge appeared to delay disease progression 
our second phase trial  d  was still underway when the d results on progression were obtained and the survival follow up was still ongoing 
based on discussions with the fda  we amended d to contain two parts d part a da included those patients enrolled regardless of gleason score  and part b db  which initially restricted enrollment to those patients most like the group of patients that appeared to benefit in d  those with gleason scores of or less 
we completed the planned three year follow up for survival on the d patients and disclosed in february that a significant survival advantage was seen in those patients who had been randomized to the provenge arm compared to those who had been randomized to receive placebo 
according to the final three year intent to treat analysis  patients who received provenge had a median survival of months compared to months for patients in the placebo arm  a month or improvement p value  hazard ratio 
this hazard ratio implies that patients who received placebo have a relative risk of dying that is percent higher than that of patients who received provenge 
in addition  percent of patients who received provenge were alive at months compared to percent of patients who received placebo 
the survival benefit seen with provenge was independent of a patient s gleason score 
a cox multivariate regression analysis was used to test the validity of the survival benefit seen in this study 
the results showed that patients who received placebo had a relative risk of dying more than twice as high as that of patients who received provenge p value  adjusted hazard ratio 
in october  we disclosed results from the second randomized phase trial  da 
trial da also did not meet its primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant delay in time to disease progression 
in the da study  the three year final survival analysis in the intent to treat population of the double blind  placebo controlled study of provenge in men with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer showed those patients who received provenge had a median survival of months compared to months for patients in the placebo arm  a month or improvement p value  hazard ratio 
a cox multivariate regression analysis of overall survival  which adjusts for the same prognostic factors known to influence survival utilized in d  met the criteria for statistical significance p value  adjusted hazard ratio 
the hazard ratio observed in this analysis was similar to that seen in our d trial 
in addition  at the three year final follow up  percent of patients who received provenge were alive compared to only percent of the patients who received placebo  a percent improvement in the survival rate 
an integrated analysis of the survival data from these two companion phase clinical studies  d and da  showed a statistically significant survival benefit in the overall intent to treat population of patients 
in this analysis  those patients who received provenge had a median survival of months compared to months for patients in the placebo arm p value  hazard ratio 
a cox multivariate regression analysis of the integrated data for overall survival also met the criteria for statistical significance p value  adjusted hazard ratio 
in addition  at the three year final follow up  percent of patients who received provenge were alive compared to only percent of the patients who received placebo 
in both studies  provenge was generally well tolerated 
we are currently conducting another phase clinical trial of provenge  db 
based on the results of the two completed phase studies  d and da  we met with the fda and have amended the db spa protocol to open the trial to men regardless of gleason score and to elevate survival to the primary endpoint 
approximately men will be enrolled and men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease are eligible for the study 
we expect to complete enrollment in the db study  now known as the impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study  prior to any prospective approval of provenge by the fda 
we recently disclosed that enrollment has been completed in a phase double blind placebo controlled trial called protect provenge trial of early prostate cancer treatment p in androgen dependent prostate cancer 
neuvenge lapuleucel t neuvenge is our investigational active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december  we announced results from two phase studies of neuvenge indicating that neuvenge stimulated an immune response and may provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced  metastatic her neu positive breast cancer 
we are evaluating future development plans for neuvenge 
preclinical research and development programs in addition to other active immunotherapies in preclinical research and development  we have monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates in preclinical research and development programs 
these also include product candidates being developed with our collaborators 
our collaboration with genentech  inc targets the development of product candidates directed against trp p  an ion channel found in prostate cancer cells 
we are currently engaged in discovering  evaluating and developing small molecule therapeutics that modify trp p function 
we have discovered selective trp p small molecule agonists that induce cell death and inhibit the growth of trp p positive tumors in animals 
lead compounds are orally bio available and potent agonists of trp p function 
our collaboration with abgenix  inc is focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibody candidates against a membrane bound serine protease 
under the terms of the collaboration  abgenix  inc will use its human antibody technologies to generate and select antibodies against this serine protease 
both dendreon and abgenix will have the right to co develop and commercialize  or  if co development is not elected  to solely develop and commercialize  any antibody product candidates discovered during the collaboration 
the companies will share equally in the product development costs and any profits from sales of products successfully commercialized from co development efforts 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we also recognize license revenue from intellectual property and technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
license fees license fees from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which we have continuing obligations  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones  revenue is recognized as if the payment was an up front fee 
personnel supported research funding under these agreements  research and development activities are performed by designated full time equivalent personnel fte during a specified service period 
the fte funding rate is an agreed upon rate comparable to other rates for similar research and development services 
payments received in advance of the research and development activities performed are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the related service period 
our performance is on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success 
product sales revenue from product supply agreements is recorded when the product is shipped  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  amounts are deemed to be collectible and all other obligations under the agreements are met 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products  and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  sfas our research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable upfront fees and milestones become due  whichever occurs first 
the value of acquired in process research and development is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and related overhead costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb  issued staff position no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities  as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and earlier application is permitted 
we adopted this new pronouncement in the fourth quarter of the adoption of fsp did not have an impact on our working capital  stockholders equity or cash flows 
the required disclosures pursuant to fsp are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
we are required to adopt sfas in our results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted by sfas if we implement changes in accounting principles that are addressed by the standard or correct accounting errors in future periods 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a legally required conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred  if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the new interpretation in the fourth quarter of the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in december  the fasb enacted sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas r  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  are effective no later than the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june  we will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method in the first quarter of  which ends march  there will be no impact on our working capital  stockholders equity or cash flows 
in addition to the recognition of expense in the financial statements  under sfas r  any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow rather than as an adjustment of operating activity in the statements of cash flows 
based on our current analysis and information available as of january   we have estimated that the impact of adopting sfas r will result in an increase of net loss and we expect basic and diluted net loss per share to be increased by approximately for the year ended december  results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue was  in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was due to revenue recognized in in connection with our license agreement with nuvelo  inc for our novel anticoagulant  recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c rnapc and all other rnapc proteins 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the termination of our collaboration with kirin brewery co  ltd 
in november in november  we licensed to kirin worldwide patent rights relating to the use of certain hla dr antibodies being developed by kirin for which kirin agreed to pay us million and released its rights to our active immunotherapy product candidates including our lead product candidate  provenge  in asia and pacific rim countries 
this agreement ended our collaboration with kirin 
the million is to be paid to us in cash in four installments  of which million was paid in december  million was paid in each of november and november and million is to be paid in november we recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of of million related to this agreement  representing proceeds received and to be received  net of a discount of for interest 
in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of monoclonal antibody  small molecule and potentially other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
we are jointly responsible with genentech for conducting preclinical and clinical work 
genentech will fund a majority of these expenses for products that reach phase clinical trials 
genentech will also be responsible for all manufacturing of resulting products 
the agreement provides for profit sharing and commercialization in the united states 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term  which represents an estimate of our continuing obligations under this collaboration 
genentech will make other option and milestone payments to us upon achievement of product development goals 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue of   and  respectively  related to this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the and increases compared with were primarily due to costs of contract manufacturing to support the db clinical trial and to prepare for commercial level production runs  personnel related costs  clinical expense due to increased patient enrollment and other costs associated with the db clinical trial  consulting fees related to the commercialization of provenge and contract research fees related to our trp p program 
financial data from our research and development related activities is compiled and managed by us as follows clinical programs  and discovery research 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs cancer cardiovascular from our acquisition of corvas indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes  and other employee related expenses including rent  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  our discovery research program costs are not assigned to specific projects 
the aggregate costs of our research and development collaborative agreements include discovery research and clinical efforts where drug technology is developed across our active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule technology platforms 
our collaborative partners benefit from the discoveries and knowledge generated across these platforms 
the majority of our collaborative agreements involve an exchange of potential rights in the territories and indications or field of science  as defined in the respective agreements  in exchange for cash payments 
our collaborative agreements track deliverables based on measures around scientific progress to which we and our partners agree on a periodic basis 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
acquired in process research and development during the twelve months ended december   we recognized an expense of million associated with the write off of the acquired in process research and development ipr d related to the corvas acquisition 
the million of ipr d represents the purchase price allocation to ipr d based on an estimate of the fair value of in process technology for projects of corvas that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses in were primarily comprised of salaries and wages  consulting fees  marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
the increase in compared with was primarily due to costs associated with the closure of our san diego facility of approximately million  increased patent legal fees due to an increase in our patent portfolio as a result of the corvas acquisition  increased consulting and audit fees to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  personnel costs  non cash board compensation expenses of  consulting fees and a retirement agreement with a former chairman resulting in cash compensation of  and non cash compensation of  interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher average interest rates  offset by a decrease in interest income earned on short and long term receivables and a declining cash and investment balance 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term investments  as well as an increase in interest income related to an outstanding receivable balance 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average capital lease balance in compared to the decrease in compared with was primarily due to lower average capital lease balances 
foreign tax benefit expense during the year ended december   we reversed our deferred foreign income tax liability and recognized a tax benefit of million based on a new tax treaty entered into between the united states and japan on march  the new treaty eliminated withholding taxes on all royalties  certain interest income and other inter company dividends 
foreign income tax expense was million in  million of which was reversed in income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based employee compensation expense in  and consisted of the amortization of deferred stock based employee compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices less than the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date  grant of restricted stock awards and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange for services and stock option modifications 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of  in  million in and  in we recorded stock based consulting expense of  and  in  and  respectively  related to grants to non employees 
we granted stock purchase rights to employees hired after august   including those involved in the corvas acquisition  which were not qualified under the employee stock purchase plan and were considered compensatory 
we recognized stock based compensation charges of approximately million and  of accrued payroll tax when the rights were exercised during the year ended december  of the million non cash stock based compensation  million was recorded as research and development expense and  as general and administrative expense 
we recorded an additional  charge in the year ended december   representing payroll and federal income tax payments made on behalf of the affected employees 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities  cash receipts from collaborative agreements  interest income earned and debt instruments 
we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of our equity securities since january   of which million resulted from our december common stock offering 
in connection with the july  acquisition of corvas  we acquired million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
on november   we entered into construction agreements with the henderson corporation and aes clean technology to perform construction improvements to our facility in hanover  new jersey 
both construction agreements are guaranteed maximum price contracts and provide for maximum payments to the henderson corporation and aes clean technology of million and million  respectively 
in february  we entered into an amendment to the construction agreement with aes clean technology in order to reflect a phased approach to the construction improvements to our hanover  new jersey facility 
we are also negotiating a similar amendment to the construction agreement with the henderson corporation 
on october   we entered into a second amendment to our bioprocessing services agreement originally dated march  with diosynth rtp  inc pursuant to this agreement  diosynth has undertaken to produce the antigen used in provenge  our investigational therapeutic active immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer  at commercial manufacturing levels to support a bla filing 
pursuant to the second amendment  diosynth will perform studies to verify the manufacturing process for the antigen and will manufacture the antigen at commercial scale to validate the manufacturing process 
the total contract price payable by us for this work is million 
if we terminate the agreement without cause  or if diosynth were to terminate in the event of our default  we would be obligated to pay diosynth a cancellation fee equal to a portion of the remaining uninvoiced contract amount 
as of december   this amount would not exceed million 
on october   we issued  shares of our common stock  priced at per share  the average closing price of our stock over the trading days preceding the amendment  in satisfaction of our initial million payment obligation under the amendment to the bioprocessing services agreement 
for accounting purposes  these shares were valued based on the fair market value of at issuance date  resulting in a charge of million 
the stock was registered under an existing shelf registration statement and the stock may be resold by diosynth without restriction 
on december   we entered into a supply agreement with diosynth covering the production of the antigen to be used in connection with provenge 
our first binding order to diosynth for commercial scale quantities of the antigen was placed on the same day to commence production in january this order is noncancelable and obligates us to pay diosynth million over the next months 
in december  we entered into the first two of a series of anticipated promissory notes the notes  with general electric capital corporation ge capital  for the purchase of equipment and associated build out costs for our hanover  nj manufacturing facility 
the notes  one with a principal amount of million bearing interest at per year and one with a principal amount of  bearing interest at  are to be repaid in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest 
the notes are secured by a master security agreement the security agreement  and two security deposit pledge agreements the pledge agreements 
pursuant to the pledge agreements  we deposited an aggregate of million as a security deposit for the repayment of the million  which finances the soft costs such as leasehold improvements and designs  and will be released pro rata upon the repayment of the loan or upon receipt of fda approval of our active immunotherapy product  provenge 
there is a material adverse change clause in the security agreement which may accelerate the maturity of the notes upon the occurrence of certain events 
we do not believe a material adverse change in our financial condition has occurred 
the million security deposit is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in restricted cash and long term restricted cash 
on january   we entered into a commitment letter with ge capital wherein ge capital has committed to make a series of loans to us up to an aggregate original principal amount of million 
this loan facility expires on july  as of december   we had financed million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment under several leases with ge life sciences and technology financings 
in  we entered into a capital lease with oracle corporation to finance our enterprise resource planning system 
the amount of remaining lease payments due under these leases as of december  was approximately million 
on august   we entered into an agreement to lease  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in hanover  new jersey 
the lease term is seven years and we have the option to extend the lease for two ten year periods and one five year period  with the same terms and conditions except for rent  which adjusts to market rate 
we intend to outfit this facility to meet the anticipated clinical and commercial manufacturing needs for provenge and our other immunotherapy product candidates in development 
property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of construction in progress related to the build out and construction of the new jersey facility 
the lease required us to provide the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit  which is recorded as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition to the letter of credit  the restricted cash balance includes a collateral amount of  which is required by wells fargo  the bank that issued the letter of credit on our behalf 
on august   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to sell up to million of our common stock from time to time 
the sec declared this registration statement sec file no 
effective in october in december  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million  or million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
as of december   million of common stock is available to be sold under this registration statement 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
in  and  these expenditures were partially offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators including license fees from kirin of million in and million in each of and and from nuvelo of  in we expect cash used in operations to increase in the future as a result of increased contract manufacturing and clinical trial activity  costs associated with operating our new jersey manufacturing facility and the ongoing development of a commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and cash generated from our collaboration arrangements  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months  including  among other things supporting our submission of a bla for provenge  manufacturing scale up and infrastructure development related to the commercialization of provenge  supporting additional clinical trials of provenge  and continuing internal research and development 
however  we may need additional financing prior to that time 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of our common stock under our shelf registration statement  or otherwise  should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials and this could adversely impact our intent to submit a bla for provenge during the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with supply agreements  debt and lease obligations  including interest and unconditional purchase obligations in thousands payment due by period contractual commitments total year years years thereafter capital lease obligations including interest operating leases facility lease obligation including interest a debt obligations including interest unconditional purchase obligations b other contractual commitments b a refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short and long term investments at december   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our financings by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
