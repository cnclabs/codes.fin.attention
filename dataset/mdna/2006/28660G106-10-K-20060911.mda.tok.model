item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this document 
on june   our board of directors approved a change in fiscal year end from january to june  effective as of june  the change was implemented to better reflect our business cycle and to enhance business planning relative to our customers retail calendars 
as a result  the financial periods presented and discussed will be as follows i the year ended june  represents the twelve months ended june   ii the year ended june  represents the twelve months ended june   iii the five month transition period represents the five months ended june   and iv the year ended january  represents the twelve months ended january  overview we are a global prestige beauty products company 
we sell our fragrance  skin care and color cosmetic products to retailers in the united states in department stores and mass retailers  as well as internationally in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance  skin care and cosmetic brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
in addition to the over prestige brands we own and license  we also distribute over additional prestige fragrance brands principally to mass retailers in the united states 
our portfolio of owned and licensed fragrance brands includes the elizabeth arden fragrance brands red door  elizabeth arden th avenue  elizabeth arden green tea  and elizabeth arden provocative woman  the elizabeth taylor fragrance brands white diamonds and elizabeth taylor s passion  the britney spears fragrance brands curious britney spears and fantasy britney spears  the hilary duff fragrance with love hilary duff  the danielle steel fragrance danielle by danielle steel  the fragrance brand white shoulders  the men s fragrances daytona  gant adventure  hummer tm fragrance for men  and ps fine cologne for men  the designer fragrance brands of alfred sung  badgley mischka  bob mackie  lulu guinness  nanette lepore  cynthia rowley  geoffrey beene s grey flannel and the halston fragrance brands halston and z our skin care brands include ceramide  eight hour cream and prevage  and our cosmetics products include the elizabeth arden brand lipstick  foundation and color cosmetics products 
our business strategy to increase net sales  operating margins and earnings is based on a growing the sales of our existing brand portfolio through new product launches and increased advertising and marketing activities  b acquiring control of additional prestige brands through licensing opportunities and acquisitions  c expanding the offering of prestige fragrance products that we distribute on behalf of other beauty companies to mass retail customers  d pursuing opportunities to improve our cost structure and working capital efficiencies  and e developing emerging markets 
we manage our business by evaluating net sales  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data and working capital utilization including through the levels of inventory and accounts receivable and operating cash flow 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered as described in item a risk factors and in the section management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
on august   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of sovereign sales  llc 
sovereign sales has been a distributor of prestige fragrances to mass retail customers in north america for over years 
we expect this acquisition to expand our north american fragrance business and increase our market share with our mass retail customers 
in addition  on june  logo 
table of contents  we acquired the brand licenses and certain assets of riviera concepts inc the acquired brands include the designer fragrance brands of alfred sung  badgley mischka  nanette lepore  cynthia rowley  lulu guinness and bob mackie and the hummer fragrance for men 
we believe the acquisition of these fragrance brands will complement our elizabeth arden fragrance portfolio 
our ability to integrate these acquisitions will be a factor impacting our financial results in the fiscal year ending june  our financial results for the fiscal year ending june   also will depend on our ability to successfully launch new products  particularly our new fragrance launches for hilary duff  danielle steel  mariah carey and a new elizabeth arden fragrance 
new product introductions require additional upfront spending for marketing  development and promotional expenses 
to the extent one or more of our new product introductions are not as successful as we had planned  it could result in a reduction of profitability and cash flow 
in the year ended june   net sales increased compared to the prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  the increase was 
sales related to initial brand launches  including the fantasy britney spears fragrance and the prevage skin care line were partially offset by lower sales of distributed brands as a result of the loss of distribution of certain brands previously manufactured by unilever cosmetics  and lower sales of brands launched last year 
gross margins decreased to in the current year period from in the prior year period as a result of proportionately higher sales of owned and licensed fragrances into mass retail channels of distribution and higher promotional sales 
product costs of new launches have also increased 
consolidation of certain retailers  primarily resulting from the federated department stores and the may company combination  and certain customers implementing inventory control initiatives also negatively affected our financial results 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june  compared to the prior year period  primarily due to an increase in royalty costs related to higher sales of licensed brands and product development costs  partially offset by lower promotional costs 
cash flow from operations improved by for the year ended june  compared to the prior year period primarily due to a reduction in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable collections 
this improvement in cash flow from operations was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses  and lower earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding our operating results and financial condition 
for additional policies  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies for the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that require more judgment is determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we often obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
logo 
table of contents our intangible assets generally consist of exclusive brand licenses and trademarks 
we do not carry any goodwill 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we periodically review intangible assets  at least annually or more often as circumstances dictate  for impairment and the useful life assigned using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks acquired in the january acquisition of the elizabeth arden business have indefinite useful lives  as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
in the third quarter ended march   we performed our annual impairment testing of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the analysis and assessments of these assets indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns represents management s estimate of future returns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for certain promotional product 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
hedge contracts 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire

table of contents stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment  sfas r  which replaced sfas and superseded apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after june  effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized during the year ended june   includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the awards vesting period 
compensation cost for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the market based restricted stock awards was determined using a monte carlo simulation model  and the fair value of all other restricted stock awards was based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
prior to july   we accounted for our stock incentive plans under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
as a result  no expense was recognized for options to purchase our common stock that were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant and no expense was recognized in connection with purchases under our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended june   the five month transition period ended june  and the year ended january  we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide accurate data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
for the year ended june   we recorded additional costs related to the adoption of sfas r  which include the effects of any grants made during the year  of approximately million approximately million  net of taxes or per basic share and per diluted share 
included in the million of total costs recorded is a charge of approximately million relating to a change in the valuation method of certain restricted stock awards as a result of the adoption of this standard 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination

table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales increased for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
the sales increase was mainly driven by million of sales related to initial brand launches  including the fantasy britney spears fragrance and the prevage skin care line  partially offset by million of lower sales of distributed brands  including as a result of the loss of distribution of brands previously manufactured by unilever cosmetics  and million of lower sales of brands initially launched last fiscal year  primarily the curious britney spears and elizabeth arden provocative woman fragrances 
the consolidation of certain retail customers  such as federated department stores and the may company  and retail customers implementing inventory control initiatives also negatively affected net sales 
we expect retailer inventory control initiatives will continue to affect net sales in the short term 
pricing changes had an immaterial effect on the net sales increase 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  gross margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  primarily as a result of proportionately higher sales of owned and licensed fragrances into mass retail channels of distribution and higher promotional sales

see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june   primarily due to higher amortization costs resulting from the addition of the prevage license and the acquisition of intangible assets from our former distributors in the people s republic of china and taiwan 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the small decrease is primarily due to lower average monthly borrowings on our revolving credit facility offset  in part  by higher interest rates on our revolving credit facility and on the interest rate swap agreement prior to our termination of that agreement in march debt extinguishment costs 
on february   we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due at the redemption price of of their par amount plus accrued interest 
as a result of the redemption  we incurred a pre tax debt extinguishment charge of approximately million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  due to lower income from operations and a lower effective tax rate 
the annual effective tax rate decreased from in the year ended june   to in the year ended june   due to increased earnings contribution from international affiliates  which generally have tax rates lower than the us federal statutory tax rate 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in the year ended june   approximately of our net sales were made during the first half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers  sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
increased sales of skin care and cosmetic products relative to fragrances can reduce the seasonality of our business 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory levels from july to october and peak receivable balances from september to december 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the months of december  january and february of each year  cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received

net cash provided by operating activities improved by approximately million for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  the improvement was primarily due to a reduction of inventory that generated approximately million of additional cash as compared to the prior year and accounts receivable generated approximately million of additional cash as compared to the prior year 
this improvement was partially offset by a logo 
table of contents decrease in accounts payables and other payables and accrued expenses of approximately million  and lower earnings of approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in the year ended june  compared to the year ended january  the decrease was primarily due to higher receivables related to timing of sales in the year ended june  versus the year ended january  and higher inventory levels largely as a result of the launch of the curious britney spears fragrance  partially offset by higher operating income and lower interest expense 
net cash used in operating activities decreased for the five month transition period ended june  compared to the five months ended june  the decrease for the five month transition period ended june  was primarily due to lower interest expense  a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from improved collection efforts  a lower increase in prepaid expenses and other costs and an increase in accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  the increase in net cash used in investing activities is a result of the acquisition of the brand licenses and certain assets of riviera concepts inc in june  higher capital expenditures and the acquisition of distributor assets in the people s republic of china and taiwan  partially offset by the sale of the miami lakes facility and related equipment that closed on august  and resulted in approximately million of cash proceeds 
we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures in the year ending june   primarily for in store counters  testing units  tools  dies and molds  computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements

table of contents future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  including brand development and marketing expenses  new product launches  additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements  capital expenditures and debt service 
in addition  we may use funds to repurchase our common stock 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance  our needs primarily through internally generated funds  our revolving credit facility and external financing 
we collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms 
we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  for which jpmorgan chase bank is the administrative agent  which provides for borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million set at million after december  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
on november   we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility that i extends the maturity of the revolving credit facility to december from june  ii reduces the interest rates and commitment fees based on our debt service coverage ratio  iii permits us to increase the size of the revolving credit facility up to million without the consent of all of the banks  and iv permits us to pay cash dividends on our common stock  repurchase our common stock or make other distributions to the common shareholders if we maintain borrowing availability after the applicable payment of at least million from june to november and at least million from december to may the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and december through may of eligible finished goods inventory and are collateralized by a first priority lien on all of the our us accounts receivable and inventory 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility rank senior to our senior subordinated notes due on august   we entered into another amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of sovereign sales  llc to i increase the revolving credit facility from million to million until december   following which the limit will be set at million  ii amend the definition of the borrowing base through december  to increase the borrowings on eligible inventory and provide for a temporary increase in borrowing availability of million  and iii include the indebtedness issued or assumed pursuant to the acquisition of certain assets of riviera concepts inc and the indebtedness issued pursuant to the acquisition of certain assets of sovereign sales  llc under permitted indebtedness as defined in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has only one financial maintenance covenant  which is a debt service coverage ratio that must be maintained at not less than to if average borrowing availability declines to less than million million from december through may 
no financial maintenance covenant was applicable for the year ended june  the revolving credit facility restricts us from incurring additional non trade indebtedness other than refinancing and certain small amounts of indebtedness 
borrowings under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the applicable margin  which is determined by reference to a specific financial ratio 
at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the reference ratio for determining the applicable margin is a debt service coverage ratio 
as a result of the november amendment to the revolving credit facility  the interest rates charged on libor loans and prime rate loans were reduced to a range of to from a range of to for libor loans  and to from a range of to for prime rate loans 
as of june   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 
as a result of the august amendment to our revolving credit facility  the interest rate charged on the first million of borrowings will be at libor plus through november  or december  depending on our borrowing availability

table of contents based upon our internal projections  we believe that the revolving credit facility  as currently amended and restated  provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  we may not remain in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio and would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  a default under our revolving credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default on our senior subordinated notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our revolving credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
as of june   we had million in outstanding borrowings and approximately million in letters of credits under our revolving credit facility and approximately million of eligible receivables and inventories available as collateral under the credit facility  resulting in remaining borrowing availability of approximately million 
we used approximately million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of certain assets of sovereign sales  llc 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or new product launches or distribution arrangements
