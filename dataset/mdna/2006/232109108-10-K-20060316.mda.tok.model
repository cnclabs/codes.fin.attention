executive summary company description 
we are a global medical device company specializing in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and other light based aesthetics system to the professional aesthetic market 
our easy to use families of products coolglide  xeo and solera enable dermatologists  plastic surgeons  gynecologists  primary care physicians and other qualified practitioners to perform safe  effective and non invasive aesthetic procedures for their patients 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory  sales  marketing and administrative activities 
outside the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  germany  japan  spain  switzerland and the united kingdom 
as of december   we had direct sales employees worldwide  a global network of distributors located in more than countries  and a distributor relationship in the united states with pss world medical 
pss s physician sales and service business operates medical supply distribution service centers with approximately sales representatives serving physician offices in all of the united states 
products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  product upgrades  amortization of pre paid service contracts  revenue from out of warranty services  and titan handpiece refills 
product revenue represents the sale 
table of contents of a system console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser or other light based module  control system software  high voltage electronics  and one or more handpieces 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications as their practice grows 
this enables customers to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue  which we classify as product upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of pre paid maintenance and support contract revenue and receipts for services on out of warranty products 
titan handpiece refill revenue is associated with our titan handpiece  which requires a periodic refilling process  which includes the replacement of the optical source  after a set number of pulses has been performed 
significant business trends 
we believe that revenue growth has been and will continue to be primarily attributable to the following investments made in our global sales and marketing infrastructure  including the expansion of our sales force and improved productivity  to increase our market penetration in an expanding aesthetic laser market 
continuing introduction of new aesthetic products and applications 
marketing to physicians outside the core dermatologist and plastic surgeon specialties  including the medi spa market 
during  our business continued to experience significant growth 
net revenue for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared to  while net revenue for increased by million  or  compared to on a geographical basis  for  compared to  our us revenue increased by million  or  and our international revenue increased by million  or 
we experienced stronger u 
s growth  versus international growth  due primarily to our increased sales and marketing efforts and our higher concentration of direct sales employees in the united states 
the slower international growth was partly attributable to reduced revenue to a national chain of clinics in japan  who purchased systems for all their members beginning in early and ending in the first quarter of our revenue is seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and accounted for and of our net revenue for and  respectively 
due to our patent litigation set for trial on may  see item legal proceedings we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase to million in each of the quarters ending march  and june  after the trial is completed  anticipated for june  we expect our general and administrative expenses to be in the range of of revenue for the remainder of starting from january   we will recognize compensation expense for employee stock options using the fair value based method see the section on recent accounting pronouncements below 
as a result  for the year ending december   we expect stock based compensation expense to increase to approximately million 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of stock based awards our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price  employee stock option exercise behaviors  and interest rates 
factors that may impact future performance 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation  including the regulation by the united states food and drug administration 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in item a risk factors section above 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize distributor and non distributor revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectibility has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
total deferred revenue for service contracts was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   was  compared with  as of december  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
allowance for inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a monthly basis and updated annually and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
our inventory balance was million as of december   compared with million as of december  our inventory allowances as of december  were  compared with  as of december  we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory allowances are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer 
table of contents demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product is sold 
warranty reserve the liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  our products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
product warranty cost is based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties by considering historical material  labor and overhead expenses and applying the experience rates to the outstanding warranty period for products sold 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates and warranty costs 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
for more information on warranty reserves  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we have stock option plans to reward our employees 
we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
and related interpretations and apply the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
we have recorded stock based compensation expense for the fair market value of restricted stock granted to employees in  and the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the option exercise price with respect to stock options granted to employees prior to our initial public offering in we amortize employee stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting terms of the underlying options 
we issue stock options to non employees  generally for services  which we account for under the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
these options are valued using the black scholes option valuation model and are subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying options vest 
changes in fair value are amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
provision for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and other foreign jurisdictions  where we have a presence 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as any related net interest 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  state taxes  benefits from disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option exercises  tax exempt interest income  and the tax impact of foreign operations 
our effective tax rate was  and for the year ended december   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue 
table of contents service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries of approximately  at december   are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
contingencies we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
as disclosed in part i  item legal proceedings  we are involved in patent litigation with palomar medical technologies  inc since the outcome of this litigation is unpredictable  no expense has been recorded with respect to the contingent liability associated with this matter 
legal fees in connection with loss contingencies are recognized as the fees are incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb originally issued sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will require companies to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record such expense in their financial statements  including grants of employee stock options 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r  as amended  is effective for public companies for the first annual period beginning after june  accordingly  the provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective january  for us 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 topic share based payment 
sab no 
addresses the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab no 
was effective immediately 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the amounts disclosed within our consolidated financial statement footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our consolidated financial statement footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to increase our cost of goods sold and operating expenses by approximately million in based upon employee stock options outstanding as of december  and estimated option grants to employees 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant impact on our consolidated income statements and the presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r also requires excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options to be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity rather than an operating activity  as currently presented 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change 
table of contents in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas further requires a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations

during the year ended december   we granted  shares of restricted stock units that vest in four equal  annual installments on the anniversaries of the date of grant 
we recorded  of deferred stock based compensation for these restricted stock unit grants  which is being amortized over a four year expected service period of the employees 
as of december   we had million of deferred stock based compensation cost related to non vested stock options and restricted stock awards  that will be expensed over the next three and a half years 
during each of the years ended december   and  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation

as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  municipal bonds and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for auction rate securities and variable 
table of contents rate demand notes of generally less than eighteen months 
for maturities of our marketable investments  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially declined by  we have international subsidiaries and operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
we cannot assure that there will not be a material impact in the future 
although the majority of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion
