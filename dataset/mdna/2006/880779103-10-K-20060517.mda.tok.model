overview terex is a diversified global manufacturer of capital equipment focused on delivering reliable  customer relevant solutions for the construction  infrastructure  quarry  mining  shipping  transportation  refining and utility industries 
the company historically has grown primarily through acquisitions  however  the company s recent increases in net sales are mainly due to organic growth from existing businesses and are attributable to a recovering end market and market share gains 
terex is in the process of building the terex brand name and concentrating on streamlining the company s processes and interfaces with the customer  including sales  marketing and accounting functions 
typically  the company s selling proposition versus the competition is that the company s equipment delivers equal or better returns on the customers equipment investment versus that offered by terex s competitors 
the company continues to be encouraged by current trends and its performance in specifically  in  the company experienced strong sales and earnings growth over the prior year  despite operational challenges such as imbalances between the company s input costs  mainly related to steel  and its pricing to customers and certain supplier issues resulting from terex s significant volume growth 
net sales in grew over the prior year 
a significant factor in the company s performance was the improved economic condition in many of the company s end markets  which was also reflected in increased backlog in a majority of the company s business segments 
backlog at december  was approximately  million  an increase of approximately million  or  from the level of backlog at december  in addition  business integration measures and cost savings initiatives put in place over the past few years are beginning to yield positive results 
the company has noted signs of improvement in some of its underperforming businesses and expects its stronger businesses to continue to post solid results in for example  the company expects opportunities for continued growth in the compact construction  aerial work platforms and materials processing and mining businesses  continuing to build on the economic recovery in these areas that took shape in and continued during however  the roadbuilding business  and other products manufactured by the company related to infrastructure improvement  have lagged the recovery somewhat  as these products rely heavily on us federal and municipal funding for their revenue base 
the company anticipates that the impact of the us federal infrastructure funding bill that was passed in will pave the way for end market improvements in as there are indications of improvement in non residential construction figures  the company anticipates that the terex cranes segment will continue to show improved end market demand and substantially better performance in 
back to index during  the company will continue to emphasize margin improvement initiatives  including pricing and cost reduction activities  as well as maintaining a focus on cash generation and debt reduction 
the company s terex business system initiative is aimed at improving the company s internal processes and benefiting the company s customers  team members and stakeholders 
the company will concentrate on the implementation of best practices across its locations  and the company will continue to strive in for a target of working capital investment as a percentage of revenue  driven mainly by inventory turn improvement 
restructuring the company continually evaluates its cost structure to ensure that it is appropriately positioned to respond to changing market conditions 
given recent economic trends  the company initiated fewer restructuring programs in and than it had in previous years  as the company s facilities were generally operating at satisfactory capacity levels 
in  the company initiated programs to reduce duplicative operating facilities  including those arising from the company s acquisitions  and to respond to specific market conditions 
the company will continue to study its options to optimize facility utilization while maintaining flexibility to respond to changing market conditions 
see note f restructuring and other charges in the company s consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s restructuring programs  including the reasons  timing and costs associated with each such program 
results of operations compared with terex consolidated of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income from operations during  the company continued to focus on external growth and on internal process improvement actions 
increasing demand for the company s products from general economic recovery in several end markets  as well as increasing penetration in new and existing markets  contributed to strong sales growth 
growth in income from operations from increased sales volume was dampened by cost pressures experienced in many purchased commodities and components  mainly steel  as well as certain internal inefficiencies arising from significantly increased production levels 
the company also generated approximately million of cash from operations and reduced its net debt defined as total debt less cash by approximately million during net sales for were  million  an increase of  million when compared to the company continued to realize the benefits of end market recoveries  the integration of its businesses  cost savings initiatives put in place over the prior three years  and the impact of the terex business system 
net sales increased in all segments when compared to the terex aerial work platforms segment experienced an increase in sales reflecting strong demand by the rental equipment market 
net sales in the terex construction segment improved relative to as a result of strong demand for products in most of the businesses 
net sales in the terex materials processing mining segment benefited relative to from sustained improvements in commodity prices  mainly coal and iron ore  and incremental sales of million from the reedrill acquisition completed at the end of net sales in the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment increased relative to across all product lines 
while sales of roadbuilding products improved over levels  they remain low relative to historic levels  and future improvements are dependent on increased state and federal funding for road projects 
net sales in the terex cranes segment improved from levels  driven by a robust tower crane market and a recovering north american rough terrain and boom truck crane marketplace 

back to index gross profit for was million  an increase of million when compared to improvements relative to were realized in all segments of the company from higher sales volume  despite sustained higher steel costs and other component issues 
the company initiated price increases across many of its businesses  accounting for some of the gross margin improvement 
the company will continue to design and implement plans to mitigate the impact of future increases in component prices  including the use of alternate suppliers  leveraging the company s overall purchase volumes to obtain favorable costs and increasing the price of the company s products 
gross profit also benefited from several of the programs initiated as part of the terex business system  as well as from restructuring initiatives launched over the prior three years 
total selling  general and administrative costs sg a increased in by million when compared to sg a costs increased as a result of compensation and related costs due to increased sales levels  as well as engineering costs due to product development efforts

during  the company incurred approximately million of external professional fees related to its accounting review of prior periods 
in addition  the acquisition of reedrill increased sg a by million 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a fell to in from in during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill in the atc reporting unit of the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment  as the atc reporting unit was determined to have a carrying value in excess of its projected discounted cash flow  due mainly to a reduction in anticipated military vehicle contracts and the impact of continued funding delays from the company s minority partner in atc 
income from operations increased by million in when compared to the terex aerial work platforms and terex construction segments income from operations improved relative to as a result of an improving economy in north america and europe 
income from operations improved in the terex material processing mining segment as a result of increased demand driven by improved commodity price levels and the acquisition of reedrill  which added million 
income from operations in the terex cranes segment grew as a result of increased demand for tower cranes  as well as improving rough terrain and boom truck crane businesses in north america 
while the concrete mixing truck and utility businesses provided positive growth in income from operations for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment  this segment incurred an impairment charge of million during related to atc and additional costs related to a reduction in the fleet size of the rental program and operating inefficiencies at utility distribution sites 
terex construction of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales in the terex construction segment increased by million in when compared to  and totaled  million 
net sales increased across most of the businesses in this segment  as improved economic conditions in the united states and europe  as well as an emerging asian construction equipment business  have driven demand for construction equipment 
net sales of heavy construction equipment remained strong during  driven primarily by demand for off highway trucks and scrap handling equipment 
the scrap handling equipment business benefited from the high price of steel globally 
the compact construction equipment operation experienced sales growth in telehandler and mini excavator equipment and the mobile crushing screening business reported double digit growth across all business units 
gross profit increased to million in  an increase of million when compared to gross profit was positively impacted by sales volume and price increases 
these favorable items were partially offset by increases in steel and other commodity costs  certain increased costs related to higher manufacturing volume  foreign currency movement and inventory charges 
sg a costs for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to sg a costs were related mainly to increased resources needed to support sales growth  while financial infrastructure and product development costs also increased over the prior year 

back to index income from operations for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to million in increased income from operations  and the resulting increased margin as a percentage of net sales  reflects the positive impact of pricing actions taken in the marketplace and the benefit of increased production levels  which helped to partially offset steel cost increases 

back to index terex cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the terex cranes segment for increased by million and totaled  million when compared to  million in the strong increase in net sales was due to a general improvement in all businesses and product categories  with particular strength in the tower crane group  when compared to net sales also increased due to price increases introduced for north american crane products in the fourth quarter of in reaction to increasing cost pressures 
gross profit for increased by million relative to and totaled million 
gross profit from the european rough terrain crane business  the container stacker business and the north american lattice boom crane business improved in as compared to levels 
the benefits of increased sales volume more than offset the negative impact of steel cost increases 
negatively impacting gross profit for was the expiration of favorable long term steel pricing contracts  mainly in the german crane operation  as well as the impact of a five week strike at the waverly  iowa cranes facility 
a field retrofit program had a million negative impact 
additionally  the north american operations incurred costs to increase production to satisfy heightened product demand  resulting in some production inefficiencies 
sg a costs for totaled million  an increase of million over sg a as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in overall  costs increased due to staffing and related costs required to address the increased sales and production volume 
income from operations for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to million in the increase was due to increased sales volume  particularly from the segment s tower cranes  which was partially offset by the increased cost of steel and increased staffing and related costs at the north american operations 
terex aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the terex aerial work platforms segment in were  million  an increase of million when compared to demand improved on a worldwide basis  with particular strength in asia and the americas 
net sales increased when compared to as a result of stronger demand from the rental channel in the united states and  to a lesser extent  improved parts sales 
rental market demand increased relative to as rental channel customers continued to buy new equipment to reduce the age of their fleets and address increased utilization of their existing fleets 
net sales of material handler products increased when compared to  due to the use of the overall genie sales and marketing approach through the same rental distribution channels as the aerial work platforms products 
light construction products also contributed to the sales growth over the prior year along with additional order activity generated to replace lost or damaged equipment resulting from hurricane katrina 
gross profit for was million  an increase of million when compared to while gross profit benefited from increased sales  this was partially offset by higher steel costs and a delay in the impact of pricing actions taken in late due to the substantial backlog that existed entering in addition  the segment experienced some inefficiencies associated with additional manufacturing resources required to respond to the significant product demand 

back to index sg a costs for were million  an increase of million when compared to the increase was due primarily to staffing and related costs arising from the significant volume increase 
income from operations for was million  an increase of million when compared to the increase was due to higher sales volumes  offset somewhat by the impact of increased steel costs and costs to ramp up production 
terex materials processing mining of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales in the terex materials processing mining segment increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase in sales was attributable to the overall strong demand for mining products  mainly the mining hydraulic excavators manufactured in dortmund  germany and electric drive mining trucks  as well as million due to the acquisition of reedrill in the fourth quarter of gross profit increased by million in when compared to and totaled million 
gross profit improved as a result of increased volume and higher margin earned on the sale of new machines 
the performance of reedrill added million of gross profit and improvement in the materials processing business also contributed to the increase in gross profit 
this improvement was partially offset by increased steel costs 
sg a expense increased by million in relative to  to million 
the increase in sg a was mainly due to costs related to additional resources needed to address higher net sales and million due to the inclusion of reedrill 
income from operations for the terex materials processing mining segment was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was a result of higher demand for the segment s products resulting primarily from improved commodity pricing relative to  the additional income from operations of million related to reedrill and improved performance in the materials processing business  offset to some degree by increased steel costs 
terex roadbuilding  utility products and other of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income from operations net sales for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment in were million  an increase of million when compared to growth was achieved in most business units  especially in the concrete mixer truck business 
gross profit in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to gross profit generally improved across all businesses 
the gross profit in this business segment was negatively pressured by steel cost increases  as steel is a major material component for many of this group s products  as well as continued weak end markets in the roadbuilding and utility areas 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by operating inefficiencies at utility distribution sites regarding installation of products and additional costs for the specialty vehicle businesses  including inventory charges and rental fleet reduction costs 
sg a costs for the segment in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to the increase in sg a costs compared to is mainly due to the sales volume increase  additional proposal activities and product development efforts 

back to index during the fourth quarter of  a goodwill impairment in the atc reporting unit was recognized due to an evaluation of carrying value in excess of its projected discounted cash flow  due mainly to a reduction in anticipated military vehicle contracts and the impact of continued funding delays from the company s minority partner in atc 
income from operations for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment in was million  an increase of million when compared to the positive change reflects strong performance by the concrete mixer truck business and the improvement initiatives taken over the past few years 
this was partially offset by the impact of increased steel costs and the additional costs for the specialty vehicle businesses 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income from operations net sales eliminations increased in over the prior year  due mainly to the efforts to cross sell terex products through existing distribution channels  largely terex construction and terex cranes products being distributed through the terex aerial work platforms segment channels 
the decrease in income from operations in was due mainly to external professional fees related to the company s investigation and audit of its historical accounting of approximately million  increased costs associated with long term incentive programs  and additional expenses resulting from increases in internal staffing to support ongoing efforts to address financial reporting weaknesses 
net interest expense during  the company s net interest expense increased by million to million as compared to net interest expense of million in the prior year 
higher interest rates more than offset the decrease in debt balances 
other income expense net other income expense net for was income of million as compared to income of million for the prior year 
the primary drivers of other income in were the gains related to the sale of fixed assets and the allocation of equity income loss to minority interests  which more than offset the amortization of debt acquisition costs 
in  million of other income expense net related primarily to the gain on sale of idle facilities and a favorable settlement related to the acquisition of the o k mining shovel business  which was offset partly by amortization of debt acquisition costs 
income taxes during the year ended december   the company recognized income tax expense of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to income tax benefit of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was higher than the prior year due mainly to the release of a valuation allowance of million on us deferred tax assets in  resulting from improved performance in several us businesses indicating that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized 
the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the release of valuation allowances in certain of the company s german businesses as a result of activities to simplify the legal entity structure and the improved performance of these businesses that indicated that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized 
also in  the company repatriated certain non us earnings from controlled foreign subsidiaries  pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of this partially offset the valuation allowance release impact on the tax rate in excluding the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets in of million  the effective tax rate for was 

back to index compared with terex consolidated of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income from operations during  the company continued to focus on external growth and on internal process improvement actions 
increasing demand for the company s products from general economic recovery in several end markets  as well as increasing penetration in new and existing markets  contributed to strong sales growth 
growth in income from operations from the increased sales volume was dampened by cost pressures experienced on many purchased commodities and components  mainly steel 
the company also generated approximately million of cash from operations and reduced its net debt defined as total debt less cash by million during net sales for were  million  an increase of  million when compared to the growth was driven primarily by strength in the terex aerial work platforms  terex construction and terex materials processing mining segments 
these product areas all experienced sharp end market recoveries during additionally  revenues were positively impacted by currency translation 
approximately of the company s sales in were made by businesses that operate primarily in currencies other than the us dollar 
during  the value of the us dollar declined relative to many of these foreign currencies  and as a result  when these sales denominated in foreign currencies were translated into us dollars  there was an increase in net sales of approximately million when compared to due solely to the variation of the exchange rates 
total gross profit for was million  an increase of million when compared to however  gross margin did not reflect the full benefit of the net sales growth  as commodity and purchased component cost increases substantially offset the company s operating efficiencies gained through fixed cost absorption 
during  the company incurred approximately million of restructuring and other costs  a decrease of approximately million over the prior year excluding a million goodwill impairment charge taken in  primarily related to costs incurred in the terex cranes  terex construction and terex materials processing mining segments to complete projects initiated in and  as well as costs to complete the exit of product lines and consolidate manufacturing facilities at the company s germany and uk locations 
sg a in increased by million when compared to the impact of a weaker dollar relative to the british pound and euro accounted for the majority of the increase in sg a in when compared to the full year effect of the acquisitions of tatra and atc increased sg a by approximately million in income from operations in increased to million  an increase of million over levels  due mainly to increased volume 
income from operations in also included a million impairment charge for goodwill 
terex construction of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations 
back to index net sales in the terex construction segment increased by million for when compared to and totaled  million 
approximately of the increase in sales over was due to the translation effect from a weaker us dollar relative to the british pound and euro 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation  sales increased mainly in the compact construction equipment product category  the scrap handler business and the powerscreen mobile crushing and screening product category when compared to specifically  the compact construction equipment businesses have benefited from the early stages of a north american recovery and stronger end markets in certain european countries  mainly the united kingdom 
scrap handling machines  sold primarily to metal scrap yards  have shown a sharp increase in demand mainly due to the higher market prices for steel  leading customers to increase their production capacity in order to benefit from these higher market prices 
the company continues to focus on increasing sales in north america by expanding its presence in the compact equipment market and by using genie sales leadership to penetrate the north american rental markets 
gross profit in the terex construction segment increased by million in when compared to and totaled million 
gross margin has been unfavorably impacted by the continued weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro and british pound in and remained basically flat at in as compared to in gross margin improved significantly in the compact construction product area in  however  as sales expansion in both europe and north america overcame pressures from raw material costs and a weaker us dollar relative to the european currencies 
additionally  gross profit relative to increased as a result of improved sales of fuchs products in the united states  benefiting from the increased demand of the scrap metal and recycling business 
overall  gross profit was negatively impacted by the impact of the weak u 
s 
dollar on products exported from europe into the united states 
sg a costs totaled million in  an increase of when compared to the increase in sg a costs was due primarily to the impact of a weaker us dollar on sg a costs reported in euro and british pounds and an increase in costs associated with investments made in sales and marketing activities 
in  the terex construction segment incurred million of restructuring and other charges as compared to million of such charges in income from operations in rose to million or of sales when compared to income from operations of million or of sales in terex cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the terex cranes segment in increased by million and totaled  million when compared to  million in the increase was mainly due to a strong tower crane business  as well as good performance in the company s stacker product line 
sales in the company s tower cranes business increased by approximately relative to  reflecting increased global activity for these cranes  especially in asia where the demand had been weak for many years 
sales of cranes and boom trucks in the united states remained flat relative to  a result of the continued weak demand for cranes in north america in the construction  infrastructure improvement and crane rental markets 
the company continues to focus on expanding sales by expanding its market share and distribution throughout europe and asia 
in north america  the company continues to focus on maintaining market share and positioning itself for an anticipated market recovery in late or gross profit in increased by million relative to and totaled million 
gross profit earned in increased relative to primarily due to the improved performance of the tower crane business  as well as general strength in international markets 
these gains were partially offset by continued pricing and cost pressure in the north american crane business 
this low level of margin performance was a result of continued weak demand for cranes and boom trucks in the united states and the resulting impact on selling margins and factory productivity 
restructuring and other non recurring items totaled a gain of million in these were primarily related to the completion of the restructuring program at the peiner tower crane facility in trier  germany and the completion of the restructuring program at the cork  ireland aerials facility 
restructuring and other costs totaled million in these costs related primarily to the closure of the peiner facility and rationalization of products offered under the peiner name  costs associated with the closure of the boom truck facility in olathe  kansas and inventory value adjustments related to discontinuance of products offered under the ppm brand that duplicated products added through the acquisition of the demag cranes business 

back to index sg a costs in totaled million  an increase of over the same period in total currency impact on the terex cranes group sg a accounted for approximately million of the total million increase 
income from operations for the twelve months ended december  totaled million compared to million for the same period in terex aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the terex aerial work platforms segment in totaled million  an increase of million when compared to the increase was a result of stronger demand from the rental channel in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the rental channels in europe  australia and asia 
rental market demand increased relative to  primarily as customers continued to replace aging equipment  however  customer fleet expansion activity also began to impact sales 
notably  net sales of the segment s material handler business increased by approximately when compared to  largely due to marketing the product as part of the overall genie offering to these same rental distribution channels 
gross profit for the terex aerial work platforms segment for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to segment gross margins were lower in than in the prior year as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher steel costs  especially during the last two quarters of however  gross margin realized by the us telehandler business did improve relative to  benefiting from improved factory productivity and additional sales leverage through the genie distribution system 
total sg a costs for totaled million  an increase of million from  although sg a costs as a percentage of sales decreased in when compared to the aggregate increase was due primarily to higher compensation and related costs  as well as increased sales and marketing activities accompanying the higher sales levels 
income from operations for the terex aerial work platforms segment for was million  an increase of million from  with a better operating margin of experienced in versus in the aggregate increase was due primarily to the significantly higher sales volumes  partially offset by cost increases from many suppliers  particularly steel 
terex materials processing mining of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income loss from operations net sales in the terex materials processing mining segment increased by million to million in compared to million in this growth in net sales reflects a robust demand for surface mining equipment in reaction to substantially higher metal and commodity prices versus a year ago 
additionally  a distribution agreement entered into with caterpillar for the company s hydraulic mining shovels has begun to positively impact the business 
parts sales were also positively impacted as more equipment was in use at mine sites 
mining equipment usage drives a strong parts business  up to of this segment s net sales are derived from parts and service revenue 
demand for the terex materials processing mining segment s products is dependent on expectations within the mining industry of future commodity prices  including those for coal and iron ore 

back to index gross profit increased by million relative to and totaled million 
gross profit in benefited from increased order activity of higher margin parts and hydraulic mining shovels  as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  there were no restructuring charges in  while there were million of restructuring and other charges in sg a expense increased by million in relative to  to a total of million 
this increase is primarily attributed to the weakening of the us dollar relative to the euro  south african rand and the australian dollar and the increase in sales costs resulting from the significant increase in sales volume 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge with respect to its roadbuilding reporting unit  as described in more detail below under terex roadbuilding  utility products and other 
at that time  the materials processing business was included in the roadbuilding reporting unit 
of the overall goodwill impairment of million  million related to the materials processing business 
as a result of the realignment of the company s segments during the quarter ended september   the materials processing business is now consolidated in the terex materials processing mining segment  and  as a result  this million portion of the goodwill impairment charge is now included in this segment s results 
income from operations for the terex materials processing mining segment was million in or of sales  an increase of million from an operating loss of million in this improvement in operating income is a result of a substantially better equipment demand environment from the impact of the higher commodity prices  the elimination of the one time impact of a goodwill write down in  and foreign currency fluctuations 
terex roadbuilding  utility products and other of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a goodwill impairment income loss from operations net sales for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment for were million  an increase of million when compared to the acquisitions of tatra and atc in august increased sales relative to by approximately million 
sales of roadbuilding products in increased modestly  but remained at a relatively low level reflecting the continued reduced activity in infrastructure projects 
the us federal government had yet to approve a new long term infrastructure spending bill  which is expected to result in the design and release of large infrastructure improvement projects 
this decline was partially offset by rental revenues generated by terex s rental business in the united states 
the utility business experienced modest growth in compared to gross profit for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to it should be noted that was impacted by restructuring and other charges totaling million  or of sales  which related primarily to inventory reductions to reflect a decrease in forecasted demand and to exit certain economically unviable niche product lines 
gross profit for also benefited from the inclusion of tatra and atc for a full fiscal year 
these gains were offset by lower margins realized in the roadbuilding and utility businesses in when compared to sg a costs for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment for totaled million  an increase of million when compared to restructuring and other charges in totaled million  primarily as a result of the product line exits described above 
again  the inclusion of tatra and atc for a full fiscal year in increased sg a costs versus during the second quarter of  the company determined that the business performance during the first six months of in the roadbuilding reporting unit which at the time included the roadbuilding business and the materials processing business would not meet the company s performance expectations that were used when goodwill was last reviewed for impairment as of october  funding for road projects had remained at historically low levels as federal and state budgets had been negatively impacted by a weak economy and the war in iraq 
in response to the revised business outlook  management initiated several changes to address the expected market conditions  including a change in business management  discontinuance of several non core products  work force furloughs and reductions  and an inventory write down based on anticipated lower sales volume 
based on the continued weakness in the reporting unit  the company initiated a review of the long term outlook for the reporting unit 
the revised outlook for the reporting unit assumed that funding levels for domestic road projects would not improve significantly in the short term 
in addition  the outlook assumed that the company would continue to reduce working capital invested in the reporting unit to better match revenue expectations 

back to index based on this review  the company determined the fair value of the roadbuilding reporting unit using the present value of the cash flow expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
the cash flow was determined based on the expected revenues  after tax profits  working capital levels and capital expenditures for the reporting unit 
the present value was calculated by discounting the cash flow by the company s weighted average cost of capital 
the company  with the assistance of a third party  also reviewed the market value of the roadbuilding reporting unit s tangible and intangible assets 
these values were included in the determination of the carrying value of the roadbuilding reporting unit 
based on the revised fair value of the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment of million was recognized during the second quarter of of the overall goodwill impairment  million related to the roadbuilding business and is included in the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment  while million related to the materials processing business and is now included in the terex materials processing mining segment 
income from operations for the terex roadbuilding  utility products and other segment for improved to million compared to a loss of million for the aforementioned goodwill impairment reduced operating profit in by million  substantially all of the favorable comparison when compared to corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income from operations net sales eliminations increased in over the prior year  due mainly to efforts to cross sell terex products through existing distribution channels  largely terex construction products being distributed through the terex aerial work platforms segment channels 
income from operations for included approximately million of costs related to the company s investigation of its historical accounting  which was more than offset by a reduction in costs associated with changes made in the company s deferred compensation plan relative to net interest expense net interest expense for totaled million  a decrease of million when compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in debt balances as the company continued to reduce outstanding obligations  partially offset by a reduction in the benefits recognized related to interest rate hedges 
other income expense net other income expense  including loss on retirement of debt  for was income of million compared to an expense of million for this change was primarily the result of the inclusion in of the income from the sale of certain facilities recognized in the second quarter of  namely  the former fermec facility in manchester  england  the former aerial platform facility in cork  ireland  the former tower crane facility in trier  germany and the former boom truck facility in olathe  kansas  along with the impact in the second quarter of of a favorable settlement reached related to the acquisition of the o k mining shovel business 
loss on retirement of debt the company initiated three debt reductions during on june   the company prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under its bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  the company recorded a related non cash charge of million 
on july   the company prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under its bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  the company recorded a related non cash charge of million 
on december   the company prepaid million aggregate principal amount of term debt under its bank credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  the company recorded a related non cash charge of million 
the non cash charges in related to the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs 

back to index the company initiated two debt reductions during on june   the company redeemed million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due the notes 
in connection with this redemption  the company recognized a loss of million 
the loss was comprised of the payment of an early redemption premium million  the write off of unamortized original issuance discount million and the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs million  which were partially offset by the recognition of deferred gains related to fair value interest rate swaps previously closed on this debt million 
on november   the company sold and issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  together with cash on hand of approximately million  were used to retire the remaining million aggregate principal amount of the notes and prepay approximately million of the company s existing bank term loans 
in connection with these retirements of debt  the company recognized a loss of million 
the loss was comprised of the payment of an early redemption premium million  the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs million and original issue discount million  which were partially offset by gains related to fair value interest rate swaps million 
income taxes during  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to an income tax expense of million on a loss before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the effective tax rate is lower than statutory rates and higher than the prior year due mainly to the release of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets that was established in  due to improved performance in several us businesses indicating that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized  the release of the valuation allowance in the fermec business due to its strong financial performance indicating that it was more likely than not that the company would realize the benefits of certain deferred tax assets  the successful resolution of a tax audit covering multiple reporting periods  the favorable determination on interest deductibility in a jurisdictional review  and the favorable resolution of certain state tax reviews 
the effective tax rate includes the establishment of a valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets  as it was determined  based on available evidence  that more likely than not the us earnings would be insufficient to realize the assets  a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the second quarter of that is partially non deductible for income tax purposes and the benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to the profitability of the company s german operations indicating that it was more likely than not that the company would realize the benefit of certain tax assets 
excluding the impact of the establishment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets in of million and subsequent reversal in  the effective tax rates for the periods would have been in and in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the company s financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that the following are among its most significant accounting polices which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of the company s accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out fifo method 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires the company to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events which could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  competitive actions including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
at december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 

back to index accounts receivable management is required to make judgments relative to the company s ability to collect accounts receivable from the company s customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors which cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
guarantees the company has issued guarantees to financial institutions of customer financing to purchase equipment as of december  the company must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party finance  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
to date  losses related to guarantees have been negligible 
customers of the company from time to time may fund the acquisition of the company s equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  the company may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company  by which the company agrees to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
the maximum liability of the company is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  the company is generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment with the company realizing the benefits of any net proceeds in excess of the remaining payments due to the finance company 
as of december   the company s maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag and genie of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally does not exceed five years 
given the company s position as the original equipment manufacturer and its knowledge of end markets  the company  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  generally has been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any  to the company 
the company issues residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note r litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  genie s maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december   with total residual value guarantees issued by the company including genie of million 
the company is able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
the company from time to time guarantees that it will buy equipment from its customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   the company s maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
the company is able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging its access to the used equipment markets provided by the company s original equipment manufacturer status 
beginning in  upon implementation of the financial accounting standards board the fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 and and rescission of fin  the company recorded a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued 
the company recognizes a loss under a guarantee when the company s obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if the company s payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value the company can expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
the company has recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  revenue recognition revenue and costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from the company to its customers which occurs upon shipment when terms are fob shipping point which is customary for the company and upon delivery when terms are fob destination 
the company also has a policy requiring it to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements 
back to index a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the company has no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  the company has the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  the company retains title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that the company can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where the company only retains title to secure its recovery in the event of customer default  the company also has a policy which requires it to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e the company has no significant obligations for future performance  and f the company is not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and has no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or the company has otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  the company analyzes factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
in limited circumstances  certain new units may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that the company hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under the company s customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from the company s inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and the company has no further obligations under the order 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
the company routinely sells equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if the company does not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if the company does retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price paid in the acquisition of a business and the fair value of the assets  both tangible and intangible  and liabilities acquired by the company 
the company reviews the value of its recorded goodwill annually to determine if it is potentially impaired  and more frequently as circumstances warrant 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that the company develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
the company relies on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the estimate also includes a determination of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by the company s equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of goodwill as well as the overall expected value of a given business 

back to index impairment of long lived assets the company s policy is to assess its ability to realize on its long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the company relies on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
accrued warranties the company records accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on the company s prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability the company records accruals for product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience  accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of the company s director of product safety 
the company provides accruals for estimated product liability experience on known claims 
the company does not accrue for reported incidents until such time as a claim is made against the company 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
pension benefits pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   the company maintained four defined benefit pension plans in the us covering certain domestic employees and a supplemental executive retirement plan that provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company 
the benefits for the plans covering the salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation 
the benefits for the plans covering hourly employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
it is the company s policy generally to fund the us plans based on the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the company maintains defined benefit plans in germany  france  ireland and the united kingdom for some of its subsidiaries 
the plans in germany and france are unfunded plans 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds  and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets held are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the foreign funded plans  approximately of the assets held are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
this allocation is reviewed periodically and the company expects to increase the allocation of fixed income securities for the foreign plan assets 
because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments  significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company s plans 
the company uses the services of several independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the three most significant variables in the models are expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors including employee turnover  retirement age and mortality which are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
the company s management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which the company operates 
the expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for us plans and for international plans at december  these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 

back to index the company s strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plan is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
while the company examines performance and future expectations annually  it also views historic asset portfolios and performance over a long period of years 
in the short term there may be fluctuations of positive and negative yields year over year  but over the long term  the actual return is expected to match the expected assumptions 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect the recognized pension expense or benefit and the company s pension obligation in future periods 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to for international plans at december  the discount rate enables the company to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for the company s pension plans were for us plans and to for international plans at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
the company has recorded the unfunded benefit obligation the minimum pension liability as a liability and reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily decreases in the discount rate for the us plans and foreign plans  resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligation of million and million  respectively 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of the plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of the plan s benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plan s estimated accumulated benefit obligation could increase  requiring an additional minimum liability and a reduction in stockholders equity 
the company expects that any future obligations under its plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if the company s contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover its future obligations  the performance of the assets in its plans does not meet expectations or assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected which would reduce the cash available for the company s business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states could require the recording of additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
the assumptions used in computing the company s net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation foreign plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of million net of valuation allowances of million 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  the company estimates income taxes based on diverse and complex regulations that exist in various jurisdictions where it conducts business 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary timing differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 

back to index the company evaluates deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the utilization of its deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type capital gain vs 
ordinary income as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income generated by the company 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated and is important because certain of the company s net operating losses expire if not used within an established time frame based on the jurisdiction in which they were generated 
a significant portion of the company s deferred tax assets are comprised of net operating losses nols generated in the united states by the company 
the company had a history of generating tax losses in the united states and has accumulated federal nols of million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  the company evaluated its ability to utilize its nols generated in the united states 
the company included the following information in its analysis the three year historical earnings of the us businesses 
the acquisitions of genie and terex advance mixer in added significantly to the company s us based income generation 
in addition  the company has continued to see an increase in demand for genie products as rental markets have demonstrated significant expansion since genie was acquired in the acquisition of reedrill at the end of in the terex materials processing mining segment also will contribute to united states based income generation 
the actual results in and increasing backlog levels evidencing improved performance 
the company has undergone significant restructuring in the united states to address market conditions in its north american crane business as well as its roadbuilding businesses 
the company believes that these businesses will benefit from improving economic conditions and that their respective end markets are showing signs of improvement 
the company has begun implementation of royalty agreements with its foreign business units  consistent with the terex branding strategy 
based on these facts  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that expected future us earnings will be sufficient to utilize certain of the company s us deferred tax assets 
in addition to its domestic nols  the company has accumulated million of foreign nols at december  during the fourth quarter of  the company also evaluated its ability to utilize these nols on a country by country and entity by entity basis 
in performing this analysis  the company reviewed the past and anticipated future earnings for each foreign entity  and  where necessary  a valuation allowance was provided for foreign nols which the company believed were not more likely than not to be realized in the future 
as of december   the total valuation allowance provided for foreign deferred tax assets was million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company released valuation allowances associated with certain of its german businesses as activities to simplify the legal entity structure and improved performance of these businesses indicated that it was more likely than not that the assets would be realized 
considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing possible exposures related to tax matters 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions taken by the company 
the company s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for probable tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  if applicable 
as the company s business has grown internationally  so has its international tax profile and the potential application of uncertain tax law 
given the subjective nature of certain areas of tax law  the results of any tax authorities audit of the company s returns could have an adverse impact on the company s net income 
the company believes it records and or discloses tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets

liquidity and capital resources the company s main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from the company s bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provides the company with adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and debt service requirements 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in addition  the company had million available for borrowing under its revolving credit facilities at december generating cash from operations depends primarily on the company s ability to earn net income through the sales of the company s products and to manage its investment in working capital 
during  the company s focus shifted from a largely acquisition oriented growth approach to improving its operating performance 
the company in introduced goals of improving operating earnings and net income as a percentage of sales and reducing the relative level of working capital needed to operate the business 
in  the focus on improving income from operations and working capital management continued 
the company is improving its liquidity through the collection of receivables in a more timely manner 
consistent with past practice  each quarter the company sells receivables to various third party financial institutions through a series of established pre arranged facilities 
the discontinuance of these facilities could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of and  the company sold  without recourse  accounts receivable approximating and of its fourth quarter revenue in and  respectively  to provide additional liquidity 
the company is reducing inventory by sharing  throughout the company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that various of its business units have used successfully 
these initiatives are expected to reduce the levels of raw materials and work in process needed to support the business and enable the company to reduce its manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing the company s working capital requirements 

back to index the company s ability to generate cash from operations is subject to the following factors a substantial number of the company s customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies 
finance companies extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of the company s equipment 
changes in either the customers credit profile or in used equipment values may impact the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
as the company s sales levels increase  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support the business may increase with a corresponding reduction in cash generated by operations 
the initiatives described above are intended to reduce the relative increase in working capital 
as described above  the company insures and sells a significant portion of its accounts receivable to third party finance companies 
these third party finance companies are not obligated to purchase accounts receivable from the company  and may choose to limit or discontinue further purchases from the company at any time 
changes in customers credit worthiness  in the market for credit insurance or in the willingness of third party finance companies to purchase accounts receivable from the company can impact the company s cash flow from operations 
the company purchases material and services from its suppliers on terms extended based on the company s overall credit rating 
changes in the company s credit rating may impact suppliers willingness to extend terms and increase the cash requirements of the business 
sales of the company s products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and foreign currency fluctuations  and other such factors that in many cases are outside the company s direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  many of the company s customers have tended to delay purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
traditionally  the company s customers peak buying periods are in the first half of a calendar year as a result of their need to have new equipment available for the spring  summer and fall construction season 
therefore  historically  the company s sales have tended to be seasonal  with more than half of the company s sales typically being generated in the first two quarters of a calendar year 
however  in  first and second half sales were relatively equal  as of the company s sales occurred in the first half of the year and of the company s sales were in the second half of the year 
this resulted from a number of factors  including price increases that were instituted by certain of the company s business in the second half of increasingly taking effect  and increased deliveries being accepted later in the year than typical because of increased demand and wait times arising from high levels of backlog in the terex aerial work platforms segment 
for  the company expects sales in the first half of the year to be slightly greater than sales in the second half of the year 
sales in the first half of are expected to be driven by the desire of the company s customers for delivery of new equipment from march through july in order to have such equipment available for the spring  summer and fall construction seasons in the northern hemisphere 
sales in the second half of are anticipated to reflect high demand for backlog orders in the aerial work platforms and mining businesses that will be accepted late in the year  an expected increase in roadbuilding orders arising later in the year as that business recovers  and anticipated orders for new products to be introduced by the terex construction segment in mid year  leading to a ramp up in sales for that group in the second half of the year 
as a result of its traditional seasonality  the company has tended to use cash to fund its operations during the first half of a calendar year and generate cash from operations during the second half of the year 
in  the company used cash to fund its operations in the first quarter of the year and generated cash in the final three quarters of the year  due largely to improved working capital efficiency and increased first half sales 
the company expects cash from operations in to be similar to the pattern 
to help fund its traditional seasonal cash pattern  the company maintains a significant cash balance and a revolving line of credit in addition to term borrowings from its bank group 
the company maintains a bank credit facility that originally provided for million of term debt maturing in july and a revolving credit facility of million that is available through july the facility also includes provisions for an additional million of term borrowing by the company on terms similar to the current term loan debt under the facility  of which the company has used million of additional term borrowings 
during  the company prepaid million principal amount of its bank term loans 
the company can borrow under its existing bank credit facilities if the company complies with a number of covenants 
these covenants require the company to meet certain financial tests  including a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio test  a consolidated interest ratio test  a consolidated fixed charge ratio test  a pro forma consolidated senior secured debt leverage ratio test and a capital expenditures test 
these covenants require quarterly compliance and became more restrictive through the third quarter of the company has significant debt service requirements  including semi annual interest payments on its senior subordinated notes and monthly interest payments on its bank credit facilities 
other than a default under the terms of the company s debt instruments  there are no other events that would accelerate the repayment of the company s debt 
in the event of a default  these borrowings would become payable on demand 
the company has stated that it would like to be in a position to redeem the million outstanding principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due following its call date of april  and to restructure its bank credit facilities in 
back to index the company is currently in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its bank credit facilities 
the company s future compliance with its financial covenants will depend on its ability to generate earnings and manage its assets effectively 
the company s bank credit facilities also have various non financial covenants  both requiring the company to take certain actions  such as keeping in good standing its corporate existence  maintaining insurance  and providing its bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis  and requiring the company to refrain from taking certain actions  such as incurring certain types of prohibited indebtedness and granting liens not permitted under the facilities 
the company obtained a waiver from its bank lending group allowing the company until may   to provide its lenders with its financial info rmation for the year ended december   including the information contained in the consolidated financial statements included herein 
the company s future ability to provide its bank lending group with financial information on a timely basis will depend on its ability to file its periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner 
the interest rates charged under the company s bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on the company s consolidated pro forma leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding portion of the revolving credit component of the company s bank credit facility was at december  the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt through interest rate derivatives 
over the long term  the company believes this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix without substantially increasing risk 
the company continues to review its alternatives to improve its capital structure and to reduce debt service costs through a combination of debt refinancing  issuing equity  asset sales and the sale of non strategic businesses 
the company s ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to the company and some impacted by general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
the company s ability to access the capital markets is also subject to its timely filing of its periodic reports with the sec  and the company s recent failure to file certain of its periodic reports on a timely basis will limit the ability of the company to access the capital markets using short form registration for a period of twelve months from the date the company becomes current with all of its sec filings 
in addition  the terms of the company s bank credit facility and senior subordinated notes restrict the company s ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of its assets
