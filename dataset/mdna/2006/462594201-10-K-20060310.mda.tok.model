item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in items and herein 
overview general we are the largest provider of wireline local exchange telecommunications services to residential and business customers in rural iowa  serving over communities across the state 
we are the second largest local exchange carrier in iowa 
iowa telecom currently operates telephone exchanges as the incumbent or historical local exchange carrier and is currently the sole telecommunications company providing wireline services in approximately of the exchanges where we serve as the incumbent 
together with our competitive local exchange carrier subsidiaries  we provide services to approximately  access lines in iowa 
our core businesses are the provision of local telephone service and network access to other telecommunications carriers for calls originated or terminated on our network 
in addition to these core activities  which generated of our total revenues in  we provide long distance service  dial up and dsl internet access and other communications services 
in  as part of our strategy of pursuing low cost growth beyond our current service area  we began to compete for customers in adjacent markets in iowa through our competitive local exchange carrier subsidiary  iowa telecom communications  inc itc 
it communications  llc it communications was formed as a subsidiary of itc in and began operations in january of together  itc and it communications are referred to as the clec or our clec operations 
factors affecting our operating performance we believe that a number of industry and company specific factors have affected and will continue to affect our results of operations 
these factors include the following the effect on our revenues of declining numbers of access lines resulting from competition and other factors and our strategic response to this trend  which includes efforts to introduce enhanced local services and additional services like dial up and dsl internet access and long distance service and to cross sell these services to our subscriber base  the effect on our revenues of our rate and pricing structure  including recent and potential future changes in rate regulation at the state and federal levels  the effect of the implementation of the iowa utilities board order deregulating retail local service rates in exchanges and the effect of the statewide election we made  effective july   to begin offering certain retail local services at deregulated rates in accordance with the new iowa law enacted in march  our ability to control our variable operating expenses  such as sales and marketing expense  and the development of our competitive local exchange carrier strategy 
access line trends the number of access lines served is a factor which can affect a telecommunications provider s revenues 
consistent with a general trend in the rural local exchange carrier industry in the past few years  the number of access lines we serve as an incumbent local exchange carrier has been gradually decreasing 
we expect that this trend will continue 
because substantially all of our revenues result from our relationships with customers who utilize our access lines and the level of activity recorded on those lines  the access line trend has an adverse impact on our revenues 
our response to this trend will have an important impact on our future revenues 
our primary strategy to respond to this trend is to leverage our strong incumbent market position to increase revenue per access line by selling additional services to our customer base  and to promote our dsl internet access 
table of contents service offering  which is often used in lieu of additional access lines devoted to internet usage 
in addition  we expect to add new access lines as we pursue expansion of our service area through our competitive local exchange carrier subsidiaries and  potentially  through selected acquisitions of lines from other telecommunications companies 
however  we believe that the number of access lines served is not the sole meaningful indicator of our operating prospects and that  given our relatively stable subscriber base and ability to offer additional services  average revenue per access line is also a meaningful indicator for us 
the table below indicates the total number of access lines served by us  the number of customers subscribing to the indicated types of service  and average revenue per access line  as of the dates and for the periods shown as of and for the year ended december  incumbent local exchange access lines competitive local exchange carrier access lines total access lines long distance subscribers dial up internet subscribers dsl subscribers average monthly revenue per access line includes lines subscribed by our incumbent local exchange carrier retail customers and lines subscribed by our wholesale customers who are competing local exchange carriers 
wholesale access lines include lines subscribed by our local exchange carrier competitors pursuant to interconnection agreements on an unbundled network element basis  for which the competitive local exchange carrier pays us a monthly fee  lines that we provide to competitive local exchange carriers for resale to their subscribers  for which the competitive local exchange carrier pays us a monthly fee equal to what we would charge our customers for local service less an agreed discount  and shared lines  for which a competitive local exchange carrier pays us a monthly fee to provide dsl service to its customers 
we had  wholesale lines subscribed at december    at december   and  at december  access lines subscribed by retail customers of our competitive local exchange carrier subsidiary  itc 
our other competitive local exchange carrier  it communications  did not begin operations until january average monthly revenue per access line is computed by dividing the total revenue for the period  excluding revenue collected in prior periods subject to refund recognized in the period  by the average of the access lines at the beginning and at the end of the period 
including the million in revenue collected in prior periods subject to refund recognized in  the average monthly revenue per line would have been 
we intend to continue our strategy of increasing revenues by cross selling services to our existing customer base  in the form of both bundled service packages and individual additional services 
between december  and december   total long distance service subscribers increased by  total dsl internet access service subscribers increased by  and total dial up internet access service subscribers decreased by  with some of the decrease in total dial up subscribers being a reflection of customer migration from dial up to dsl service 
thus  while our total access line count fell by in and increased by only in  average revenue per access line for the period grew by from to we believe the primary contributors to our ability to maintain our revenue stream during a time of decreasing access lines have been our success at selling additional services and our ability to increase our pricing 
the following is a discussion of the major factors affecting our access line counts cyclical economic and industry factors 
we believe that the general downturn in economic conditions since has had a negative effect on our access line counts 
we expect that improved performance in the iowa 
table of contents economy will stabilize this cyclical factor 
in addition  incumbent local exchange carriers generally experienced an unusual increase in access line demand during the late s  as households purchased additional lines devoted to dial up internet access 
in our view  this spike in access line demand in the late s was not sustainable over the long term  and current access line levels are more indicative of underlying demand 
competition 
competitive local exchange carriers are offering service or are in the process of beginning to offer service in approximately of the incumbent local exchange communities that we currently serve 
of these communities  were subject to competition at the time of the acquisition of the iowa property from gte in we believe that most of these competitive local exchange carrier incursions and subsequent line losses were related to customer dissatisfaction with the previous provider s service 
since  we believe we have slowed significantly the loss of customers to competitive local exchange carriers by providing additional service offerings  focusing our marketing efforts and implementing competitive pricing 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing some line losses due to competition from wireless providers  but cannot precisely quantify the effect of this competition on us 
we are responding proactively to the threat of wireless competition by offering bundled service packages that include blocks of long distance minutes 
these packages are designed to meet the demand of our customers who wish to purchase both local and long distance services in a package  as is typically offered by wireless providers 
as a result of the competition that we face in specific iowa communities  regulation of rates we charge for retail local exchange service in communities has been eliminated 
in december  the iowa utilities board determined that effective competition existed in exchanges where we operate as the incumbent local exchange carrier and issued an order deregulating the pricing of local service in these exchanges 
we implemented this order in the first quarter of and are offering deregulated pricing in these markets 
in addition  on december   the iowa utilities board deregulated our otherwise still regulated single line flat rated residential and business service in more exchanges in which we face competition 
we implemented that deregulation effective january  we believe implementation of these orders will enhance our ability to compete and regain market share in these exchanges 
we elected  effective july   to deregulate our rates for all retail local exchange services except for single line flat rated business and residential service and extended area services in accordance with legislation enacted by the iowa general assembly in march under this law  single line flat rated business and residential service and extended area services will also be deregulated as of july  unless the iowa utilities board determines that the public interest requires it to extend its jurisdiction over such services to july  this legislation also provides us the opportunity to increase rates for services that remain price regulated  as discussed in more detail below 
we believe that the gradual deregulation of our business will enable us to better respond to competitive offerings by other providers 
exchange sales 
we currently have agreed to two exchange sale transactions  subject to certain regulatory approvals and conditions  in which we will sell approximately  lines 
in each of these cases  we believe the sale price makes the disposal economically compelling 
we expect that the two pending sales will result in million of net cash  and as part of one transaction we have already purchased the buyer s dial up and dsl internet businesses since this component of the transaction did not require regulatory approval 
additionally  we completed the sale of one exchange with less than access lines in february ancillary effects of our data businesses 
part of our decreasing line count has been an ancillary effect of our strategic focus on growing our dial up and dsl internet access service business 
as our internet service provider business expanded  some competitors have cancelled their connections to our network 
these connections had historically been counted as access lines 
moreover  as we increase dsl internet access service penetration  customer demand for second lines for dial up internet access service decreases accordingly  because dsl internet access service obviates the need for a second line dedicated to internet usage 
we believe that the revenue generated by our dial up and dsl internet access services outweighs the effect of these types of access line loss 

table of contents our retail local rate and pricing structure basic business and residential telephone service  intrastate switched access  extended area services to the extent offered in conjunction with single line flat rate service  and e services  white pages directory listings and dual party relay service are all regulated as basic communications services by the iowa utilities board 
the iowa statutory price regulation plan pursuant to which we operated before july  provided a mechanism to adjust our rates for basic communications services to reflect the impact of inflation 
on april   we entered into a settlement agreement relating to an iowa utilities board rate proceeding we had initiated in as a result of the settlement agreement  effective april   our monthly charges for basic local service in all of our exchanges were consolidated and  on average  were increased 
pursuant to our settlement agreement relating to the iowa utilities board rate proceeding  most of the resulting incremental regulated local basic service revenues we receive as a result of these rate increases must be expended on capital improvements to our network 
our rates for other non basic services we provide  including local services like caller id  call waiting  call forwarding  voice messaging  centrex station lines  private lines and directory assistance  long distance services and data services like dial up and dsl internet access  are not price regulated 
as described under overview competition above  effective july   the rates for all of our retail local exchange service except for single line flat rated business and residential service and extended area services were deregulated 
beginning july   monthly rates for single line services remaining under price regulation may be adjusted annually by one dollar for residential lines and two dollars for business lines  up to a monthly rate cap of for residential lines and for business lines 
rates may be further adjusted annually to reflect the effect of inflation 
if the iowa utilities board decides to continue price regulation to  the annual rate increase caps will be doubled to two dollars and four dollars and the overall rate caps of and will be eliminated 
effective january   our regulated monthly single line flat rated business rate became 
effective february   our regulated monthly single line flat rated residential rate became 
both rates are exclusive of charges for extended area services  taxes  fees and regulatory surcharges 
deregulation of retail local service rates we offer a variety of bundled packages on a deregulated basis  particularly in our competitive markets 
in addition  we have also exercised our ability to modify prices on single line flat rated residential and business service in the exchanges in which such offerings are deregulated 
the ability to offer these services on a deregulated basis provides us with the flexibility to more quickly respond to new competition and enhances our ability to regain market share in previously competitive exchanges 
in addition  it allows us flexibility to create bundled packages that can more effectively compete against wireless and other competitors 
our ability to control operating expenses we strive to control expenses in order to maintain our operating margins 
we anticipate that operating expenses generally will remain stable in line with revenue growth 
because many of our operating expenses  such as those relating to sales and marketing  are variable  we believe we can calibrate expenses to growth in the business to a significant degree 
development of our competitive local exchange carrier strategy part of our business strategy is to use our competitive local exchange carrier subsidiaries  itc and it communications  to pursue customers in markets adjacent to our rural local exchange carrier markets 
we plan to continue this strategy by seeking growth opportunities on a low cost  selective basis 
as of december   our clec operations served approximately  business and  residential access lines 
itc accounted for of iowa telecom s total access lines as of december  as of december   our net investment in the clec was million  the majority of which relates to customer acquisition and marketing expense 
throughout  we plan to maintain this limited investment approach as we continue to grow our competitive local exchange carrier business 

table of contents revenues we derive our revenues from four sources local telephone services 
we receive revenues from providing local exchange telephone services 
these revenues include monthly subscription charges for basic service  as well as charges for extended area services a mandatory expanded calling service to selected nearby communities at a flat monthly rate  local private line services and enhanced calling features  such as voice mail  caller id and way calling 
during we also received revenues from expanded local calling plans optional service to additional selected nearby communities at an additional flat monthly rate 
we discontinued expanded local calling plans in the third quarter of network access services 
we receive revenues from charges established to compensate us for the origination  transport and termination of calls generated by the customers of long distance carriers and for calls transported and terminated for the customers of wireless carriers 
these include subscriber line charges imposed on end users  and switched and special access charges paid by carriers 
in addition  we receive federally administered universal service support  representing approximately of our total revenue in  as a result of the interstate switched access support provisions of the fcc s calls order to which the company became subject in switched access charges for long distance services within iowa are based on rates approved by the iowa utilities board 
switched and special access charges for interstate and international services are based on rates approved by the fcc 
the transport and termination charges paid by wireless carriers are specified in interconnection agreements negotiated with each individual wireless carrier 
toll services 
we receive revenues for providing toll  or long distance  services to our customers 
this revenue category also includes fees relating to our provision of directory assistance  operator assistance and long distance private lines 
other services and sales 
we receive revenues from monthly recurring charges for dial up and dsl internet access services 
other services and sales also include revenues from directory publishing  inside line care and the sale and maintenance of customer premise equipment 
the following table summarizes our revenues and sales from these sources revenue and sales for year ended december  of total revenues and sales for year ended december  dollars in thousands local services network access services toll services other services and sales total local services revenue for includes the recognition  as a result of our rate settlement with the iowa utilities board in april  of million of revenue collected in prior periods subject to refund

selling  general and administrative expense 
this includes expense for salaries  wages and benefits and contract service payments eg  legal fees relating to customer and corporate operations  recruiting costs  expenses for travel  lodging and meals  internal communications costs  insurance premiums  and supplies and postage

table of contents local services 
local services revenues decreased million  or  for  as compared to  primarily due to million of revenue collected subject to refund in prior periods and recognized during our new rates established under the settlement agreement with the iowa utilities board became effective on april  also contributing to the decrease was the loss of million in revenues resulting from the discontinuance of the expanded local area calling plans during the third quarter of  as more fully described below  and the decrease in total access lines 
these reductions were partially offset by the benefit of the april  rate increase for the entire period of  which resulted in additional revenue of million 
in addition  we experienced an increase in revenue from enhanced local services of million for as compared to  due to the growth of bundled product offerings 
from december  to december   total access lines decreased by  including the loss of  incumbent local exchange carrier lines and an increase in lines served by our competitive local exchange carriers of  our historical ability to provide expanded local calling plans at favorable margins depended on the existence of an agreement for mutual exchange of traffic with another telecommunications provider 
that agreement terminated on july  as a result  we discontinued the expanded local calling plans and encouraged customers who subscribed to our expanded local calling plans to replace those plans with substitute services 
the termination of the agreement for mutual exchange of traffic and discontinuance of our expanded local calling plans have affected several of our revenue streams and our costs of services and sales 
local services revenue for included million from the expanded local calling plans that have been discontinued 
while that revenue stream has ended  we have increased our long distance and access revenues as subscribers migrate from our expanded local calling plans to toll plans 
network access services 
our network access services revenues increased million  or  for as compared to revenues from switched access services increased approximately million  due primarily to an increase in access minutes per line which is due in part to the elimination of the expanded local calling plans 
toll services 
our toll services revenues increased by  or  for as compared to this revenue growth was attributable to an increase in the number of long distance customers of approximately  or  partially offset by a decrease in average minutes of use per customer and average revenue per minute 
other services and sales 
other services and sales revenues increased by million  or  for as compared to the revenue increase was primarily due to growth in the number of dsl internet customers 
dsl internet access service revenues increased million  or  due primarily to customer growth 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in dial up internet revenues of million and a decline in revenue from customer premise equipment sales of  we believe the decline in dial up internet access service customers is generally the result of customer migration to broadband products such as our dsl service

cost of services and sales increased million  or  for as compared to the increase in long distance customers  coupled with the termination of the historical agreement for the exchange of traffic related to our discontinued local calling plans  resulted in approximately million of additional cost to deliver long distance traffic 
as a result of customer growth  we experienced an increase in competitive local exchange carrier access lines which  in turn  raised costs for providing this service by million for as compared to selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  for as compared to the period includes a million favorable impact resulting from past access disputes with other carriers 
offsetting this favorable impact was a million increase in salary  wages and benefits  million of external costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance and other costs related to being a publicly traded company 
salary  wages and benefits for includes a pension settlement charge of approximately million for distributions related to amendments to the pension plan during the second quarter of the amendments to the plan will reduce our future pension obligations 
also contributing to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits was additional non cash equity based compensation expense of million related to exercise price reductions on vested outstanding stock options under the stock incentive plan to reflect the dividends on our common stock and expense for the unvested shares issued under the stock incentive plan 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  for as compared to this was primarily due to higher average property  plant and equipment balances relating mainly to additions to our network facilities

table of contents income tax expense a valuation allowance has been provided at december  for our deferred tax assets that expire over time to the extent that they exceed the net deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from reversing temporary differences 
prior to fiscal  we had not paid income taxes 
during fiscal  we paid  of alternative minimum tax 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance  including our consideration of our ability to generate sustainable future taxable income 
to the extent we continue to generate taxable income in future years and it is determined that such valuation allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit of the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time 
as of december   the balance of the valuation allowance was approximately million 
our unused tax net operating loss carryforward was approximately million  and will expire between and as of december  we have a  alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the amt credit carryforward due to its indefinite life 
our initial public offering resulted in an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code  and consequently our ability to utilize our net operating losses will be subject to limitation each year 
we currently anticipate that  as a result of such ownership change  we will generally be limited by section to utilizing approximately million of our pre transaction net operating losses annually 
however  internal revenue code section may allow for an increase in this allowance for tax periods ending in through after  the internal revenue code section limitation will apply 
furthermore  we expect that we will continue to be able to take deductions related to the amortization of intangibles in excess of the amount recorded for book purposes in the amount of approximately million annually through redemption of preferred stock on march   we repurchased our series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock and related accrued dividends for an aggregate purchase price of million

the increase in information technology expenditures was due to information technology system replacements  most significantly our end user billing system 
the reduction in other was due to our transition to providing dial up and dsl internet access service internally  partially offset by higher dsl spending 
pursuant to the terms of our april iowa utilities board rate proceeding settlement  we were obligated to spend million of the basic service revenues that we collected while the rate proceeding was pending on capital improvements to our network  in accordance with a network improvement plan approved by the iowa utilities board on may  this million was in addition to our baseline level of network capital expenditures  assumed for purposes of implementing the settlement to be million per year  and were to be expended in calendar year to the extent practical and feasible 
the iowa utilities board settlement agreement also required that substantially all additional revenues generated by the new rates approved pursuant to the agreement  except for revenues resulting from inflation adjustments  be invested in capital improvements identified in the network improvement plan  in addition to our baseline level of network capital expenditure 
our capital investment in our network and support assets as a result of the settlement agreement was million in  approximately million in and is expected to be approximately to million dependent on regulated access lines in each subsequent year until i we have expended million of the additional revenues generated by the rates approved in the settlement agreement or have completed all projects described in the network improvement plan  whichever occurs later  ii our local service rates are deregulated  or iii we submit a price regulation modification proposal  which we have agreed not to do until we have invested  cumulatively  at least million in network improvements in addition to our baseline level of network capital expenditures 
after we have spent the required million of cumulative capital expenditures in excess of our baseline level  the capital spending commitment will increase or decrease consistent with access line changes 
we remain subject to these investment commitments to the extent we continue to offer retail local exchange service on a regulated basis 

table of contents in accordance with our rate settlement with the iowa utilities board  we will invest in our network under our network improvement plan for through that was approved by the iowa utilities board in january we expect to invest in our network in a variety of ways  including network technology upgrades in the form of switch upgrades and replacements and the installation of fiber cable  the further deployment of dsl capacity throughout our service area  and upgrades in our central offices 
we expect that total capital expenditures will be approximately million to million in fiscal we expect to fund all of these capital expenditures through cash generated by our operations 
our capital expenditures can fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and are impacted to some extent by factors beyond our control  such as customer demand  the level of construction activity in our region  and weather 
we believe that the deregulation of local retail services will reduce our capital expenditure obligations pursuant to our rate settlement agreement 
on august   the fcc released an order increasing the obligations of carriers to report service outages to the fcc 
most significantly  the order required us to report certain non customer affecting events related to our fiber optic transmission facilities 
as part of an industry wide effort requesting that the fcc reconsider this requirement  we stated to the fcc  in industry wide hearings held on november   that compliance would cause iowa telecom to incur at least million of additional capital expenditures over a period of three to five years 
as a result of the industry efforts  on december   the fcc delayed the effectiveness of the rule until the fcc reconsiders the matter 
at this time  we cannot predict the result of this fcc reconsideration  or the impact the final rules may have on our operations 
on september   the fcc released an order determining that facilities based broadband providers and providers of interconnected voice over internet protocol voip services must be prepared to accommodate law enforcement wiretaps pursuant to the communications assistance with law enforcement act calea by may  this order is currently under appeal by a variety of organizations and entities 
the fcc intends to issue a further order delineating the details of the obligation established in its september  order in  but is also considering establishing exemptions for small and rural entities in addition to or as part of calea s existing process for considering carrier specific compliance extensions and exemptions 
at this time  we cannot predict the specific nature of any new broadband and voip related calea obligations that may ultimately become and remain applicable to us

the credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets  properties and revenues as well as those of all of our current and future subsidiaries 
the credit facilities are guaranteed by all of our current and future subsidiaries 
the credit facilities permit us to pay dividends to holders of our common stock  however  they contain significant restrictions on our ability to do so

the purpose of the swap agreements is to adjust the interest rate profile of our debt obligations and to achieve a targeted mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
as a result of these arrangements  the effective all in interest rate on million of indebtedness under term loan b for the period beginning august  and ending november  is 
the previous swap arrangements that we entered into on november   effectively fixed the interest rate we would have paid on specified portions of our indebtedness under term loan b

as of december   no letters of credit were outstanding 
we currently project that cash provided by operations will be adequate to meet our foreseeable operational liquidity needs for the next months 
however  our actual cash needs and the availability of required funding may differ from our expectations and estimates  and those differences could be material 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  the demand for our services in our existing markets and regulatory  technological and competitive developments 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical  as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial statements and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
the following is a summary of certain policies considered critical by management impairment of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we reduce the carrying amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment  and to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  we consider historical operating results  as adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by us in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets resulted from the annual valuation of goodwill we conducted in august revenue recognition 
revenues are recorded based upon services provided to customers 
we record unbilled revenue representing the estimated amounts customers will be billed for services rendered since the last billing date through the end of a particular month 
the unbilled revenue estimate is reversed in the following month when actual billings are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects reserves for customer receivables to reduce receivables to amounts expected to be collected 
in estimating uncollectible amounts  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical customer payment trends and anticipated customer payment trends 
while we believe our process effectively addresses our exposure for doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may require adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded by us 
income taxes 
management calculates the income tax provision  current and deferred income taxes  along with the valuation allowance based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not they will not be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  for our deferred tax assets that expire over time to the extent that they exceed the net deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from reversing temporary differences 
prior to fiscal  we had not paid income taxes 
during fiscal we paid  of alternative minimum tax 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the related 
table of contents valuation allowance  including our consideration of our ability to generate sustainable future taxable income 
to the extent we continue to generate taxable income in future years and it is determined that such valuation allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit of the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time 
as of december   the balance of the valuation allowance was approximately million 
our unused tax net operating loss carryforward was approximately million  and will expire between and as of december  we have a  alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the amt credit carryforward due to its indefinite life 
at december   our unused tax net operating loss carryforward was million  and will expire between and the amount of net operating loss allowable to offset income after a change in ownership is limited under internal revenue code irc section however  irc section may allow for an increase in this allowance for the periods ending in through irc section will continue to apply after furthermore  we expect that we will continue to be able to take deductions related to the amortization of intangibles in excess of the amount recorded for book purposes in the amount of approximately million annually through employee related benefits 
we incur certain employee related benefits associated with pensions and other postretirement health care benefits opeb 
we use third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expenses associated with these employee related benefits 
in order to measure the expense associated with these employee related benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses  compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated healthcare costs 
the estimates used by management are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
different estimates could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different time periods 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors the discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our expected benefit payments  the expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions  and the healthcare costs trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following table presents the key assumptions used to measure pension and opeb expense for and the estimated impact on pension and opeb expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb jan may  june december  discount rate expected return on plan assets na healthcare costs trend rate current na na level in na na increase in expense for sensitivities pension opeb in thousands decrease in discount rate decrease in expected return on plan assets na increase in healthcare costs trend rate na off balance sheet risk and concentration of credit risk the company has no known off balance sheet exposure or risk 

table of contents certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
these financial instruments consist primarily of trade receivables and cash and temporary cash investments 
we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
we also periodically evaluate the credit worthiness of the institutions with which we invest 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the interest rate profile of our debt obligations and to achieve a targeted mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
the floating rate payers under the interest rate swap agreements are nationally recognized counterparties 
while we may be exposed to losses due to non performance of the counterparties or the calculation agents  we consider the risk remote and do not expect the settlement of these transactions to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and to record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a rule that defers the effective date for adoption to the first fiscal year beginning after june  adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows because all of our outstanding stock options were fully vested at the date of issuance of sfas r 
grants of stock based awards under the stock incentive plan or modifications to outstanding stock options after the effective date of the standard may result in additional compensation expense pursuant to the provisions of sfas r 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on the financial results of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our short term excess cash balance  if any  is typically invested in short term commercial paper 
we do not invest in any derivative or commodity type instruments 
accordingly  we are subject to minimal market risk on our investments 
under the terms of our credit facilities as amended  our long term secured debt facilities will mature november our million of indebtedness under term loan b  maturing in  bears interest per year at either a libor plus or b a base rate plus 
on august   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with nationally recognized counterparties for the purpose of fixing the interest on a portion of these borrowings 
pursuant to the swap agreement  we will pay a fixed rate of interest on term loan b on a notional million from august  through november  we pay interest at a fixed rate on all borrowings under term loans c and d through november thereafter  we expect our interest rates under term loans c and d to convert to the rural telephone finance cooperative variable rate then in effect  as provided in the credit facilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk  resulting primarily from fluctuations in libor  with respect to million of borrowings under term loan b through november similarly  changes in libor will be the primary source of interest rate risk we face with respect to the million of borrowings drawn under the revolving credit facility at december  with respect to our million of borrowings under terms loan c and d  we are exposed to interest rate risk  resulting primarily from fluctuations in the rural telephone finance cooperative s variable rate  from november through maturity in november a one percent change in the underlying interest rates for the variable rate debt that was outstanding on december  would have an impact of approximately  per year on our interest expense while our fixed rates and swaps are in place
