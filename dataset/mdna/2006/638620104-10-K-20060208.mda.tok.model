item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview to facilitate your review and understanding of this section of our report and the financial statements that follow  we are providing an overview of what management believes are the most important considerations for understanding our company and its business the key factors that drive our business and the principal associated risks 
the company we are a public equity reit that invests in health care properties  to date primarily senior housing and long term care properties 
passive investments our investments are passive ie  we do not operate the properties  investor flexibility liquidity investors desiring to invest in this real estate sector can do so with an investment flexibility and liquidity that is not available in most direct real estate investments  and no double taxation our income is not taxed at the corporate level as long as we continue to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income and meet other reit tax requirements 
business purpose our long term corporate goal is to provide stockholders with an attractive total return based on a secure dividend 
our business model for achieving this goal is based on a foundation of proactive capital and portfolio management and quality ffo growth 
we invest passively in geographically diversified health care properties to date primarily assisted and independent living facilities and skilled nursing facilities  drawing on our management expertise and operational experience in this real estate sector 
our focus remains on the health care sector because we believe in its growth potential  as evidenced by the favorable demographics of a rapidly growing elderly population and the corresponding recognized need for additional and improved senior housing  long term care and other health care alternatives 
operations we primarily make our investments by acquiring an ownership interest in facilities and leasing them to unaffiliated tenants under triple net master leases that pass all facility operating costs insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance  capital improvements  etc 
through to the tenant 
in addition  but intentionally to a much lesser extent because we view the risks of this activity to be greater  from time to time we extend mortgage loans and other financing to tenants 
currently  about of our revenues are derived from our leases  with the remaining from our mortgage loans and other financing 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it excludes the effect of depreciation and gains losses from sales of facilities both of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
additionally  funds from operations is widely used by industry analysts as a measure of operating performance for equity reits 
we therefore discuss funds from operations  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate funds from operations in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 

table of contents last three years after investing only about million in  during the last two years we have been very active in the investment market 
in we announced  of new investments  of which  closed in  approximately  of which closed on january  with the balance expected to close in february this follows  of new investments that were completed in during  we successfully completed a restructuring of the debt portion of our capital structure 
as part of our restructuring plan  we repurchased  of our senior unsecured notes with interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from november to march issued  of senior notes at a fixed rate of with a ten year maturity that was used for acquisitions during the year and to finance the note repurchases replaced our  credit facility with a new  credit facility comprised of a  revolving facility with a three year term and an option to extend for an additional year and a  five year term loan 
in addition to expanding the amount available under the credit facility  we were able to reduce the all in cost of our debt by basis points 
in  we focused on de leveraging the balance sheet by raising approximately  in net new equity with a combination of common stock and preferred stock 
in we began the de leveraging process by raising approximately  of proceeds from the issuance of new common stock 
in connection with that offering  we made an approximately reduction in our dividend 
the overall goal in all three years has been to balance the debt and equity components of our capital structure  to enhance our credit statistics  preserve and strengthen our investment grade credit ratings moody s investors service baa  standard poor s ratings services bbb and fitch ratings bbb  increase our net income and ffo and improve our cost of capital to position ourselves to do accretive acquisitions in an increasingly competitive market 
purchase option exercises and mortgage loan payoffs have negatively impacted our revenues and ffo growth over the last few years  especially in and  and we expect they will adversely impact us to an even greater extent in in certain situations we provide purchase options to our tenants or the ability to prepay a loan to our borrowers 
while some of the purchase option exercises and loan payoffs that have occurred over the last few years or are expected to occur in resulted from ordinary course negotiations  a significant portion were due to concessions made in the late s and early s when many skilled nursing and assisted living operators  including many of our tenants  faced significant financial problems brought on by capital market excesses  government reimbursement issues and  in the case of assisted living  overbuilding 
while our risk profile was improved as a result of these repayments  our net income was negatively impacted by redeploying the capital into lower yielding new investments or using it to pay down the balance on our credit facility 
focus and outlook for in we will focus on improving our net income and ffo on an absolute and per share basis 
we expect rent escalators in our leases to generate net income growth of over and ffo growth of over in while the market remains extremely competitive  we continue to see potentially attractive investment opportunities that we will carefully evaluate 
we will also explore alternative property types  capital sources and investment structures that would enable us to compete more effectively in the markets in which we currently invest 
this would potentially include additional joint ventures much like the one through which we made our first investment in medical office buildings in january we believe that any growth in net income or ffo from acquisitions and escalators will be at least partially offset by dilution from purchase options being exercised and mortgage loan repayments during the year 

table of contents in management s view  there continue to be four principal near term challenges we face in achieving our business objectives 
the first is the continued availability of competitively priced capital 
this in turn is largely dependent on external factors such as interest rates and equity market volatility 
short term interest rates rose significantly in and we believe some additional increase is likely in longer term rates were relatively flat for the year  and while many experts expect them to remain so for  it is certainly possible these rates may increase as well 
in addition  we saw high equity market volatility in as well 
if these capital sources end up being more expensive than we expect in  it could adversely impact our ability to grow 
the second challenge is increasing interest in assets traditionally owned in our sector from a number of foreign and domestic capital providers in addition to our health care reit competitors  including some of our operators 
this increased competition is reducing rent yields relative to our cost of capital and limiting our ability to successfully compete for attractive investment opportunities 
the third principal challenge is possible consolidation at the reit level and continued consolidation at the operator level which is likely to result in better capitalized competitors and fewer customers 
finally  there may end up being more serious operator financial problems that lead to more extensive restructurings or tenant disruptions than we currently expect 
this could be unique to a particular operator or it could be industry wide  such as further federal or state governmental reimbursement reductions in the case of our skilled nursing facilities as governments work through their budget deficits  reduced occupancies for our assisted and independent living facilities due to general economic and other factors and increases in liability insurance premiums or other expenses 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that impact our most critical accounting policies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our rental revenue is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
among other authoritative pronouncements 
these pronouncements require us to account for the rental income on a straight line basis unless a more appropriate method exists 
we believe that the method most reflective of the use of a health care facility with fixed rate increases is the straight line method 
straight line accounting requires us to calculate the total fixed rent to be paid over the life of the lease and recognize that revenue evenly over that life 
in a situation where a lease calls for fixed rental increases during the life of a lease or there is a period of free rent at the beginning of a lease  rental income recorded in the early years of a lease is higher than the actual cash rent received which creates an asset on the balance sheet called deferred rent receivable 
at some point during the lease  depending on the rent levels and terms  this reverses and the cash rent payments received during the later years of the lease are higher than the rental income recognized  which reduces the deferred rent receivable balance to zero by the end of the lease 
the majority of our leases do not contain fixed increases or provide for free or reduced rent at the beginning of the lease term 
however  certain leases for facilities we have constructed have had free rent for the first three to six months and certain leases we entered into  primarily for facilities returned to us by tenants in bankruptcy have had reduced or free rent in the early months of the lease or fixed increases in future years 
we record the rent for these facilities on a straight line basis in accordance with sfas no 
however  we also assess the collectibility of the deferred portion of the rent that is to be collected in a future period in accordance with sab no 
this assessment is based on several factors  including the financial strength of the lessee and any guarantors  the historical operations and operating trends of the facility  the historical payment pattern of the facility and whether we intend to continue to lease the facility to the current tenant  among others 
if our 
table of contents evaluation of these factors indicates we may not receive the rent payments due in the future  we provide a reserve against the current rental income as an offset to revenue  and depending on the circumstances  we may provide a reserve against the existing deferred rent balance for the portion  up to its full value  that we estimate will not be recovered 
this assessment requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating the future rent payments may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the rent that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding a lease change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the rental revenue recognized and or deferred rent receivable balance 
we recognized  of cash received in excess of revenues during   of cash received in excess of revenues during and  of revenues in excess of cash received during deferred rent receivables  net of reserves  totaled  at december   and  at december   recorded under the caption other assets in the balance sheet 
we evaluate the collectibility of the deferred rent balances on an ongoing basis and provide reserves against receivables we believe may not be fully recoverable 
the ultimate amount of deferred rent we realize could be less than amounts recorded 
additional rents are generally computed as a percentage of facility revenues in excess of base amounts or as a percentage of the increase in the consumer price index 
we do not straight line rent contingent on revenue increases or increases in the consumer price index 
additional rents are generally calculated and payable monthly or quarterly  and most of our leases contain provisions such that total rent cannot decrease from one year to the next 
while the calculations and payments of additional rents contingent upon revenue are generally made on a quarterly basis  sab no 
does not allow for the recognition of this revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
most of our leases with additional rents contingent upon revenue are structured as quarterly calculations so that all contingencies for revenue recognition have been eliminated at each of our quarterly reporting dates 
depreciation and useful lives of assets we calculate depreciation on our buildings and improvements using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging up to years  generally from to years 
a significant portion of the cost of each property is allocated to buildings generally approximately 
the allocation of the cost between land and building  and the determination of the useful life of a property  are based on management s estimates 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on equipment and lease costs using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of up to five years or the lease term  whichever is appropriate 
we review and adjust useful lives periodically 
if we do not allocate appropriately between land and building or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our assets  our computation of depreciation and amortization will not appropriately reflect the usage of the assets over future periods 
if we overestimate the useful life of an asset  the depreciation expense related to the asset will be understated  which could result in a loss if the asset is sold in the future 
asset impairment we review our long lived assets individually on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

indicators may include  among others  the tenant s inability to make rent payments  operating losses or negative operating trends at the facility level  notification by a tenant that it will not renew its lease  a decision to dispose of an asset or changes in the market value of the property 
for operating assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we compare the undiscounted cash flows from the expected use of the property to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is higher than the current net book value  in accordance with sfas no 
 we conclude no impairment exists 
if the sum of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows is lower than the current net book value  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
to the extent we decide to sell an asset  we recognize an impairment loss if the current net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
the above analyses require us to determine whether there are indicators of impairment for individual assets  to estimate the most likely stream of cash flows from operating assets and to 
table of contents determine the fair value of assets that are impaired or held for sale 
if our assumptions  projections or estimates regarding an asset change in the future  we may have to record an impairment charge to reduce or further reduce the net book value of such asset 
during the year ended december   we recognized impairment of assets charges of   of which related to two skilled nursing facilities and  related to one facility that will no longer be operated as a skilled nursing facility 
the latter impairment includes the write down of the facility to its estimated fair value less costs to sell  a reserve against a receivable from the tenant of the facility and the write off of certain capitalized lease costs 
in addition  we had an impairment of  against one land parcel in assets held for sale 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of assets charge of  in discontinued operations related to one of our assets held for sale 
collectibility of receivables we evaluate the collectibility of our mortgage loans and other receivables on a regular basis 
we evaluate the collectibility of receivables based on factors including  among others  payment history  the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors  the value of the underlying collateral  the operations and operating trends of the underlying collateral  if any  and current economic conditions 
if our evaluation of these factors indicates we may not recover the full value of the receivable  we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate will not be recovered 
this analysis requires us to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that will not be collected 
if our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of a receivable change in the future  we may have to record a reserve to reduce or further reduce the carrying value of the receivable 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb released sfas no 
revised share based payment 
in we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
in we adopted the original sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and have recognized all stock based compensation in our income statement since that time 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
r was not material to our financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force released issue no 
determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf creates a framework for evaluating whether a general partner or a group of general partners controls a limited partnership or a managing member or a group of managing members controls a limited liability company and therefore should consolidate the entity 
eitf states that the presumption of general partner or managing member control would be overcome only when the limited partners or non managing members have certain specific rights as outlined in eitf eitf is effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified 
eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired in  facilities acquired during and rent increases at existing facilities 
the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us during interest and other income decreased  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of ten mortgage loans during  partially offset by two new mortgage loans receivable funded during interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or  over the increase was primarily due to interest on the  of senior notes issued in may  the assumption of 
table of contents  of secured debt during the first half of and  during  an increase in the interest rates on our floating rate debt and an increase in the average balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  of senior notes during the third quarter  the prepayment of  of secured debt during the third quarter  the repayment of  of secured debt during the third quarter and the repayment of  of senior notes during the third quarter general and administrative expenses increased  or  over primarily due to amortization of restricted stock grants and increases in general corporate expenses 
during  we recognized an impairment of assets charge of  in continuing operations  related to a receivable from a tenant that operated two of our facilities 
the  relates to the facility the tenant continues to operate while discontinued operations reflects an impairment of  related to the other building which was closed and transferred to assets held for sale during during the year ended december   we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of  due to the repurchase of  of senior notes in the third quarter 
prior to our acquisition of jer senior housing  llc s jer interest in our joint venture in may of  income from unconsolidated joint venture represented our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
the decrease of  or  from is due to the recognition of only four months of income in prior to our acquisition and the recognition of our share  equal to  of a gain on the sale of one of the joint venture s facilities of  partially offset by charges related to the refinance of the joint venture s debt  consisting of the write off of deferred finance charges  our share of which was  and a prepayment fee  our share of which was  compared to twelve months of income in please see the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the formerly unconsolidated joint venture 
discontinued operations decreased  or  versus the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  is comprised of impairment charges of  depreciation of  and  of general and administrative expenses  partially offset by rent revenue of  and gain on sale of  the income for the year ended december  is comprised of  of rental income and  of gain on sale  partially offset by  of depreciation and amortization and  of general and administrative expenses 
the difference in the composition of the loss from discontinued operations was primarily caused by the impairments in and the fact that the facilities sold in had income in but do not have income in  while the assets held for sale generate expenses but generally do not produce income 
any future income or loss in discontinued operations would result from future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale 
we expect to receive increased rent and interest at individual facilities because our leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
if revenues at our facilities and or the consumer price index do not increase  our revenues may not continue to increase 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgage loans receivable would serve to offset revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this could reduce revenues 
our leases could renew below or above the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may cause a decrease or an increase in the total rent we receive 
we currently have only eight leases covering facilities expiring in the exercise of purchase options by tenants or the sale of facilities as part of our portfolio management program would also cause a decrease in the total rent we receive 
we believe our tenants may exercise certain purchase options and we may sell certain facilities as part of our portfolio management program during we believe these potential sales could result in proceeds of up to  during that time 
however  we do not have any control over whether  or in certain cases when  our tenants will choose to exercise any available purchase options 
we currently have one scheduled mortgage loan maturity at the end of december additional investments in health care facilities would increase rental and or interest income 
at this time we expect to make acquisitions during  although the quantity and timing of any such acquisitions cannot be accurately forecast 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense will also increase 
we expect any such increases to be at least partially offset by rent or interest income associated with the investments 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  rental income increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to rental income from facilities acquired and one facility that was completed during and rent increases at existing facilities 
the increase was partially offset by rent reductions on certain facilities that were returned to us during and reserves against certain receivables that may not be collectible 
interest and other income decreased  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the early payoff of eight mortgage loans  the payoff at maturity of two mortgage loans  and partial repayments of four others during interest and amortization of deferred financing costs decreased  or  in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes in  the payoff of  of fixed rate medium term notes during and a decrease in the weighted average balance on our unsecured credit facility as compared to the decrease was almost entirely offset by interest related to  of assumed mortgage debt secured by eight facilities acquired during and interest on a  mortgage secured by one existing building financed during the third quarter depreciation and amortization increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily related to depreciation on the facilities acquired and one facility that completed development during general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to a one time charge of  for retirement compensation related to our retiring chief executive officer   of expense related to the lease up of a restructured skilled nursing facility  the addition of a chief portfolio officer position  an increase in legal fees  sarbanes oxley related expenses and increases in other general corporate expenses 
income from unconsolidated joint venture represents our share of the income generated by the joint venture and our management fee of of the revenues of the unconsolidated joint venture 
please see the caption investment in unconsolidated joint venture below for more information regarding the unconsolidated joint venture 
discontinued operations reflects income of  in versus income of  in discontinued operations consists of gain loss on sale of facilities and income loss from discontinued operations 
the gain on sale of facilities in of  resulted from the sale of two skilled nursing facilities  two assets held for sale and one land parcel for total cash proceeds of  and the recognition of  of deferred gain upon the payoff of three mortgage loans 
the loss on sale of facilities in of  resulted from the sale of ten facilities  four buildings held for sale and four land parcels held for sale 
the income for is comprised of revenues of  less depreciation on the facilities sold in of  and  of general and administrative expenses related to assets held for sale 
the income for is comprised of  of rental income offset by  of depreciation and amortization   of general and administrative expenses and an impairment of assets charge of  related to three assets held for sale 
the difference in the composition of the loss from discontinued operations was primarily caused by the fact that the facilities sold in had income in  but do not have income in  the facilities sold in had income in but had income for only a portion of and the assets held for sale generate expenses  but generally do not produce income 
any future income loss in discontinued operations would result from future sales of facilities or reclassifications of facilities to assets held for sale 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture during  we entered into a joint venture with jer senior housing  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of jer partners  an institutional investor 
the joint venture was established to invest up to  of which over  was invested in health care facilities similar to those already owned by us 
the financial statements of the joint venture were not consolidated with our financial statements and our investment was accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents on may   we acquired jer s interest in our joint venture  jer nhp senior housing  llc  for approximately  as part of this transaction  we assumed the secured debt the joint venture had in place of approximately  approximately  of which represented jer s share  resulting in a payment to jer of approximately  net of other costs and fees related to buying out their interest of approximately  as a result of this acquisition  we now own of the assisted living facilities in states that are leased to brookdale senior living  inc formerly alterra healthcare corporation under two cross defaulted master leases with initial terms expiring in from the transaction date forward  the operations of jer nhp senior housing  llc have been consolidated with our existing operations 
during  prior to our acquisition of jer s interest  the joint venture sold one facility for net cash proceeds of  resulting in a gain of  included in discontinued operations of the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased  or  over this was primarily due to increased income from new acquisitions and the existing portfolio prior to non cash impairment charges and changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities 
there have been no significant changes in the underlying sources and uses of cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities during  we acquired skilled nursing facilities and assisted and independent living facilities in eight separate transactions for an aggregate investment of  including the assumption of  of mortgage financing 
in addition  we exchanged two facilities plus  for two different facilities owned by american retirement corporation 
we also funded  in expansions  construction and capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with existing lease provisions 
such expansions  construction and capital improvements generally result in an increase in the minimum rents earned by us on these facilities 
the acquisitions  expansions  construction and capital improvements were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and by cash on hand 
at december   we had committed to fund additional expansions  construction and capital improvements of approximately during  we sold five skilled nursing facilities of which three were sold to the tenants of the facilities pursuant to purchase options  two assisted and independent living facilities and two land parcels for cash proceeds of  these sales resulted in a gain of  that is included in gain on sale of facilities in discontinued operations 
during  we funded two mortgage loans secured by two skilled nursing facilities in the amount of  in addition  one fully amortizing mortgage loan receivable was repaid at maturity 
financing activities during  we issued  of fixed rate notes that will mature on may  and bear interest from may  that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  we repurchased  of fixed rate medium term notes that bore interest at a weighted average rate of during the third quarter 
we also repaid  of fixed rate medium term notes that bore interest at a weighted average rate of at maturity during the first quarter 
the repayments were funded by borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility  the million note issuance discussed above and by cash on hand 
as part of the joint venture acquisition  we assumed secured debt of approximately  with a floating rate equal to libor plus  of which approximately  represented jer s share 
this debt was subsequently refinanced with a five year term loan at a fixed rate of 

table of contents during  we prepaid  of secured debt with an average interest rate of and repaid  of secured debt at maturity 
we anticipate repaying medium term notes at maturity with a combination of proceeds from borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility and cash on hand  however  there are no medium term notes currently maturing until november  when  mature 
borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility could be repaid by potential asset sales or mortgage loans receivable payoffs  the potential issuance of debt or equity securities under the shelf registration statements discussed below or cash from operations 
our medium term notes have been investment grade rated since our current credit ratings are baa from moody s investors service  bbb from standard poor s ratings services and bbb from fitch ratings 
during august we repurchased  shares of our series a cumulative preferred step up reit securities that pay dividends at a rate of through september and at a rate of thereafter 
the amount paid to repurchase the shares was  plus accrued dividends 
the repurchase resulted in a charge of   of which represents the original issue discount on these shares 
during  we adopted a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
this plan enables existing stockholders to purchase additional shares of common stock by automatically reinvesting all or part of the cash dividends paid on their shares of common stock 
the plan also allows investors to acquire shares of our common stock  subject to certain limitations  including a maximum monthly investment of  at a discount ranging from to  determined by us from time to time in accordance with the plan 
the discount during and at december  was 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately  shares of common stock  at an average price of  resulting in net proceeds of approximately  that were used to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
at december   we had  available under our new  unsecured credit facility 
on october  we replaced our previous  credit facility with our new  credit facility that is comprised of a  revolving facility with a three year term that we may extend at our option for one additional year and a  five year term loan 
at our option  borrowings under the agreement bear interest at prime at december  or libor plus at december  
we pay a facility fee of per annum on the total commitment under the agreement 
the revolving facility matures october  which we may extend for an additional year and the term loan matures october  the financial covenants are detailed below covenant requirement minimum net asset value cap rate is  previously maximum total indebtedness to capitalization value minimum fixed charge ratio maximum secured indebtedness ratio minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum unencumbered asset value ratio as of december   we were in compliance with all of the above covenants 
we believe we have sufficient margin in the various debt covenants that we expect to remain in compliance throughout in january  we issued  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share 
this issuance resulted in net proceeds of approximately  after underwriting discounts and legal and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay all of the then outstanding borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility of  and the remaining proceeds of approximately  were initially invested as cash and cash equivalents and ultimately used to fund acquisitions subsequent to the public offering and for other general corporate purposes 
in july  we issued  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share 
the issuance resulted in net proceeds of approximately  
table of contents after underwriting discounts and other fees of approximately  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder at an initial conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events  including our stock reaching a price of per share 
we may redeem the series b preferred stock after july  at the redemption price of per share  reducing each year by  until reaching par  or in july at december   we had a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue up to  of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
in addition  at december   we had approximately  shares available for issuance under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
financing for future investments and for the repayment at or prior to maturity of the obligations and commitments noted above may be provided by borrowings under our revolving credit facility discussed above  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity either under the shelf registration statement discussed above or under new registration statements  potential asset sales or mortgage loans receivable payoffs  the assumption of secured indebtedness  obtaining mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we anticipate the possible sale of certain facilities  primarily due to purchase option exercises  and the potential repayment of certain mortgage loans receivable during in the event that there are facility sales or mortgage loan receivable repayments in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
we anticipate using the proceeds from any facility sales or mortgage loans receivable repayments to provide capital for future investments  to reduce the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility or to repay other borrowings as they mature 
any such reduction in debt levels would result in reduced interest expense that we believe would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
we believe the combination of the available balance on our new  unsecured credit facility and the availability under the shelf registration statements provides sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain our current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity  for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements subsequent to our acquisition of jer s interest in our joint venture we did not utilize any other off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any unconsolidated subsidiaries 
contractual obligations and cash requirements as of december   our contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total in thousands contractual obligations long term debt interest expense operating leases commitments capital expenditures the long term debt amount shown above includes our senior notes  our notes and bonds payable and the balances on our unsecured credit facility comprised of a revolving portion of  with a three year term that expires on october  and a term loan portion of  with a five year term that expires on october  at our option  we may extend the three year facility for one additional year 
prior to  or upon expiration  we expect to replace the credit facility rather than repay the outstanding balances 

table of contents interest expense shown above is estimated assuming the balances on the three year term and five year term portions of our unsecured credit facility remain constant until their respective maturities and that the interest rates in effect at december  remain constant for the unsecured credit facility and the  of floating rate notes and bonds payable

table of contents we provide mortgage loans to tenants of health care facilities as part of our normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
eight of our mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rates are equal to the then current rates 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
we utilize debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in health care facilities 
historically  we have made short term borrowings on our variable rate unsecured credit facility to fund our acquisitions until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of our secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain health care facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by us on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with this variable rate secured debt 
during the twelve months ended december   the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility have increased from  to for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt other than the housing revenue bonds described above  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
we generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amounts and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity 
maturity date thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable  net average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate unsecured revolving credit facility average interest rate
