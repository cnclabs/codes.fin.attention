fm appraisals has historically provided these services to first mariner mortgage and will begin marketing appraisal management services to outside lenders in critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
when applying accounting policies in such areas that are subjective in nature  management must use its best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
one of the most critical accounting policies applied is related to the valuation of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral and the timing of loan charge offs 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio taken as a whole 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of bank regulators and independent loan review firms  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and peer comparisons are also factors 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction and change in the interest rate environment  which may impact a borrower s ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking and financial services industry and economic conditions specific to our service areas 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used in determining the allowance for loan losses and a detailed discussion of factors influencing possible changes in this critical accounting estimate is included in the credit risk management section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion compares our financial condition at december  to the financial condition at december  and results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and related notes as well as statistical information included in this report 
performance overview we continued to achieve significant growth in loans and deposits while producing a record profit in  leveraging our infrastructure to produce significant increases in revenue while maintaining the growth rate of our operating expenses 
this resulted in higher levels of net income  earnings per share  and improved return on average assets and average equity 
we recorded net income of million for compared to million for  an increase of  marking our highest net income for any year since first mariner s formation  and the fifth consecutive year of record profits 
diluted earnings per share were also the highest in our history  totaling per share for  an increase of from per diluted share in the growth in net income and earnings per share resulted as our gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income increased million or  while our noninterest expenses  the provision for loan losses  and income tax expense increased by million or 
our largest category of revenue  net interest income  grew million or due to growth in average earning assets of 
noninterest income increased million or due to higher levels of mortgage banking revenue of million and higher insurance sales commissions of  we experienced higher fee income from most other major sources of operating noninterest income 
our increase in total expenses resulted from higher noninterest expenses of million and an increase in our income tax expense of  our provision for loan losses also increased by million 
noninterest expense growth was primarily the result of higher salaries and benefit costs 
the increase in income tax expense reflects lower levels of tax exempt interest income for income tax purposes relative to total pretax income and higher levels of pretax net income 
the increase in our provision for loan losses is largely a function of our loan growth and resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to of total loans as of december  from as of december  return on average assets was for compared to for return on average equity for was compared to for average equity to average assets was for compared to for our total assets increased by million or  reflecting a significant increase in loans and loans held for sale  which were funded by increases in deposits and borrowed funds 
loans outstanding increased by million or and loans held for sale increased by million or  while our deposits grew by million or 
stockholders equity increased million or reflecting the retention of s earnings and shares sold and issued for the exercise of options  warrants  and our employee stock purchase plan 
these items were offset somewhat by the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase plan  and the reduction in other comprehensive income driven by the decline in the market value of securities classified as available for sale 
we continued to enjoy favorable asset quality in our allowance for loan losses was increased to million and totaled of nonperforming assets as of december   compared to as of december  our ratio of net chargeoffs to average total loans was in  compared to in our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to at december  from at december  capital adequacy levels remained strong  exceeding the levels we are required to maintain for well capitalized status as defined by banking regulation 
december  ratios for our capital leverage  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets were   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at december  our regulatory capital levels increased as the growth rate of regulatory capital exceeded growth rates in total and risk adjusted assets 
results of operations net interest income margins our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income we earn is determined mostly by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
net interest income for totaled million  an increase of over million for the improvement in net interest income during was due in large part to an increase in our average earning assets from the level of billion to the level of billion 
our yield on earning assets also increased  from for to for the benefit realized from increased yields on earning assets was more than offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings  which increased from for to for as a result  the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets decreased to for  as compared to for the comparable period in net interest margin is the key performance measure for our net interest income 
our net interest margin is affected by our loan pricing  our mix of earning assets  and our distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
the yields we earned on average total earning assets increased by basis points  while the cost of interest bearing deposits and borrowings we paid increased by basis points 
interest income 
total interest income increased by million primarily due to growth in average loans and loans held for sale 
average loans outstanding increased by million  with increases in almost every loan category 
average loans held for sale increased million 
yields on earning assets for the period increased to from due to the higher mix of loans and loans held for sale which carry higher yields than investments and other earning assets and increases in market interest rates 
the yield on total loans including loans held for sale increased from to and was primarily driven by increased commercial and residential construction rates and consumer rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  due to increases in both average interest bearing liabilities  which increased by million  and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  which increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in average interest bearing deposits of million was driven by increases in savings  money market  and time deposits 
an increase in average borrowings of million was due to additional short term advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta the fhlb 
the increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was a result of increased mix of borrowings as a percentage of interest bearing funding sources and higher interest rates

our noninterest income for the year ended december  totaled million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
higher revenue from our mortgage banking activities  and an increase in insurance sales commissions were the primary causes of the increase in noninterest income 
gains on sales of loans  which are derived from both the volume of loans sold and the pricing at which they are sold  increased by million or compared to the year ended december  total volume of mortgage loans we sold into the secondary market increased 
the higher revenue from increased volume was somewhat offset by modestly tighter pricing margins and increases in forfeited revenue for early prepayments and defaults 
our other mortgage banking fees increased by  or 
origination related income increased by  while our mortgage servicing revenue decreased  the increase in our origination related income occurred primarily due to the growth in volume of mortgage originations 
income from reinsurance  appraisal and inspection activities increased by  service fees on our deposit accounts increased by  or as we increased the number of demand deposit accounts by  or 
we increased our pricing on some of our deposit service charges  such as monthly maintenance fees  during compared to our atm fees increased by  or  due to increased customer transaction volume 
we did not realize any net gains from the sale of investment securities in  compared to net gains of  for income from bank owned life insurance decreased by  in due to a decline in crediting rates on policies held 
commissions earned on the sale of nondeposit investment products primarily fixed annuities decreased  due to lower rates offered by insurance carriers  which reduced demand for these products  which led to our reduced production of these products 
commissions from the sale of other insurance products primarily insurance products offered through finance maryland increased  due to expansion of finance maryland s locations and increased loan origination activity

the tax incentives we earned total million based upon a confirmation received from the maryland department of business and economic development 
we will realize the benefits of the incentives in our reported earnings as the credits can be utilized  in accordance with accounting standards that govern the recognition of investment tax credits 
the amount of the credit that we can utilize will be determined by the level of maryland taxable income for the bank only  and will be recognized as a reduction in our income tax expense 
any unused one maryland credits can be carried forward and will expire in the job creation tax credit can be carried forward for five years 
we expect the bank to fully realize the full value of the credits before their expiration 
we have utilized all prior net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december  our net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes approximated million and can be offset by the future state taxable income of first mariner bancorp only 
operating loss carry forward tax benefits are in addition to the tax credits discussed above 
currently  we believe that it is more likely than not that the future operations of first mariner bancorp will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the potential utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforward of  to reflect this uncertainty 
financial condition at december   our total assets were billion as compared to billion at december   an increase of 
earning assets increased million or to billion from billion 
the growth in assets was primarily due to growth in loans outstanding million and higher levels of loans held for sale million offset by a decrease in investment securities million 
premises and equipment increased million primarily due to the purchase of our headquarters building 
growth in total assets was funded by an increased level of customer deposits of million and by a net increase in borrowed funds including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and repurchase agreements of million 
we continued to achieve growth through the development of our bank branching and mortgage loan office network  expansion of our commercial and retail business development efforts  our expansion of finance maryland  and successful development and marketing of our deposit and loan products 
investment securities available for sale our investment portfolio at december   is comprised of highly marketable securities  with over secured by the us government or us government agencies 
the maturity structure of our investment portfolio is significantly influenced by the level of prepayment activity on mortgage backed investments 
at december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was years  longer than the average duration of years at december  this is largely the result of an increase in interest rates  which has extended the expected maturity of mortgage backed investment securities 
we utilize the investment portfolio as part of our overall asset liability management practices to minimize structural interest rate and market valuation risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we continually monitor the credit risk associated with corporate investments  the risk is diversified  as the maximum exposure to any one corporate issuer is slightly more than of total investment securities 
total investment securities declined million due to normal principal payments on mortgage backed securities  scheduled maturities of other investments  and a decline in market values 
at december   our net unrealized loss on securities classified as available for sale totaled million  compared to  at december  we consider the decline in market values to be temporary largely due to increases in interest rates  and do not expect to realize losses on any of the securities currently in the investment portfolio 
our investments in trust preferred securities  corporate obligations  and common stocks totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  there were no securities sold during the year ended december   and purchase activity amounted to million 
the investment portfolio composition is as follows as of december dollars in thousands mortgage backed securities trust preferred securities us government agency notes us treasury securities obligations of state and municipal subdivisions corporate obligations equity securities foreign government bonds other investment securities the amortized cost  estimated fair values  and weighted average yields of debt securities at december   by contractual maturity  are shown below

mortgage backed securities are assigned to maturity categories based on their final maturity 
loans our loan portfolio is expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume and mix of loans and the volume and mix of loans as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of our net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio as of december dollars in thousands commercial loans and lines of credit commercial residential construction commercial mortgages residential construction consumer residential mortgages consumer total loans total loans increased million during the underlying economic strength in our core market  affordable interest rates  and continued emphasis on business development all contributed to the continued growth in loans 
the largest increase in our loan portfolio occurred in the commercial residential construction category  which increased by million  and in the commercial mortgages category  which increased by million 
growth in these types of our commercial loans reflected successful marketing and sales efforts of the bank s commercial lending unit  a strong regional economy  as well as the continuation of a favorable interest rate environment 
our consumer loans increased by million due to successful marketing campaigns  a favorable economic and interest rate environment  growth in consumer finance receivables generated by finance maryland  and successful cross selling of home equity products to first mortgage customers 
residential construction loans to consumers decreased million as our origination activity in this product line decreased due to increased competition 
our residential real estate loans  which consist primarily of and year adjustable rate mortgages  decreased by  approximately of our loans have adjustable rates as of december  compared to approximately at december   including adjustable rate first mortgages indexed to either us treasury obligations or libor and variable home equity lines of credit tied to the prime interest rate 
our variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  our interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall  the interest we earn would decline  thus impacting our interest income 
see our discussion in interest rate sensitivity later in this section for more information on interest rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for our loan portfolio at december  some of our loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  the following table should not be used as a forecast of our future cash collections 
maturing in one year or less after through years after years dollars in thousands fixed variable fixed variable fixed variable total commercial loans and lines of credit commercial residential construction commercial mortgages residential construction consumer residential mortgages consumer total loans credit risk management we attempt to manage the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio through various control processes  such as credit evaluation of borrowers  establishment of lending limits  and application of lending procedures  including the holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances 
however  we seek to rely primarily on the cash flow of our borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies are designed to minimize our risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio  as well as general and regional economic conditions 
our allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses continually based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due  and other loans that we believe require special attention 
the allowance consists of three elements specific reserves for individual credits  general reserves for types or portfolios of loans based on historical loan loss experience  judgmentally adjusted for current conditions and credit risk concentrations  and unallocated reserves 
combined specific reserves and general reserves by loan type are considered allocated reserves 
all outstanding loans are considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance does not provide for estimated losses stemming from uncollectible interest because we generally require all accrued but unpaid interest to be reversed once a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
we deploy a systematic methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses that includes a quarterly review process and adjustment to our allowance 
our process includes updates on all loans that we have rated for risk 
our commercial loans are generally reviewed individually  while large groups of homogeneous loans are reviewed as pools 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both qualitative and quantitative 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience by loan type  collateral values  financial condition of borrowers  and other factors 
qualitative factors include judgments concerning general economic conditions that may affect credit quality  credit concentrations  the pace of portfolio growth  and delinquency levels  these qualitative factors are evaluated in connection with our unallocated portion of our allowance for loan losses 
we periodically engage outside firms and experts to independently assess our methodology  and perform various loan review functions 
our methodology employs management s judgment as to the level of future losses on existing loans based on our internal review of the loan portfolio  including an analysis of the borrowers current financial position  the consideration of current and anticipated economic conditions and their potential effects on specific borrowers 
in determining our ability to collect certain loans  we also consider the fair value of any underlying collateral 
however  our determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions we make about future events  which we believe are reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that our charge offs in future periods will not exceed our allowance for loan losses or that we will not need to make additional increases in our allowance for loan losses 
the process of establishing the allowance with respect to our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios begins when a loan officer initially assigns each loan a risk grade  using established credit criteria 
risk grades are subject to review and validation annually by an independent consulting firm  as well as periodically by the our internal credit review function 
management reviews  on a quarterly basis  current conditions that affect various lines of business and may warrant adjustments to historical loss experience in determining the required allowance 
adjustment factors that are considered include the level and trends in past due and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures or underwriting standards  and the experience and depth of lending management 
historical factors by product type are adjusted each quarter based on actual loss history 
management also evaluates credit risk concentrations  including trends in large dollar exposures to related borrowers  and industry and geographic concentrations 
all nonaccrual loans in the commercial and nonresidential real estate portfolios  as well as other loans in the portfolios identified as having the potential for further deterioration  are analyzed individually to confirm the appropriate risk grading and accrual status  and to determine the need for a specific reserve 
consumer and residential mortgage loans are segregated into homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics 
trends and current conditions in retail and residential mortgage pools are analyzed and historical loss experience is adjusted accordingly 
adjustment factors for the retail and residential mortgage portfolios are consistent with those for the commercial portfolios 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for losses that are not identified when establishing the specific and general portions of the allowance and is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
such conditions include general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in delinquencies and nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio categories  recent loss experience in particular loan categories  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  findings of internal loan examiners  and management s judgment with respect to various other conditions including loan administration and management and the quality of risk identification systems 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly 
we have risk management practices designed to ensure timely identification of changes in loan risk profiles  however  undetected losses may exist inherently within the loan portfolios 
the judgmental aspects involved in applying the risk grading criteria  analyzing the quality of individual loans and assessing collateral values can also contribute to undetected  but probable  losses 
our provision for loan losses is a charge applied to earnings in the current period to maintain our allowance at a level we have determined to be adequate based upon factors noted above 
we increased the amount of our allowance in primarily due to loan growth 
our allowance for loan losses to our total loans was as of december   up from as of december  our provision for loan losses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our allowance for loan losses at december  totaled million  as compared with the december  balance of million  an increase of million or 
we recognized net charge offs of million and million for and  respectively 
our net charge offs as a percentage of our average loans were for compared to in our net charge off levels for the bank were  in compared to  in  reflecting lower charge offs associated with construction loan and residential mortgage loans 
finance maryland net charge offs totaled million of average consumer finance loans in compared to  of average consumer finance loans in we consider the allowance to be sufficient to address the credit losses inherent in the current loan portfolio

management may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a day past due loan that is both well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan remains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest or when past due payments are received in cash in the case of finance maryland consumer loans and the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current 
as a result of our ongoing review of the loan portfolio  we classify loans as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrowers financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
we recognize interest on nonaccrual loans only when it is received 
the following table provides information concerning nonperforming assets and past due loans dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans real estate acquired by foreclosure total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more and accruing as of december   we had million in nonaccrual loans  as compared with million at december  we held other real estate owned of  at december   compared to  at december  our nonperforming assets  the total of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned  decreased to of our total assets at december  from of our total assets at december   reflecting the decrease in our total level of nonperforming assets and an increase in total assets 
our allowance for loan losses represented of nonperforming assets as of december  compared to as of december  our loans past due days or more and accruing decreased significantly  ending at  compared to million at the end of potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  however  management has designated these assets as potential problem loans due to concerns about the ability of the obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms that may result from the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the above table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million 
two of the loans of total potential problem loans are commercial relationships that are well secured by commercial real estate and other business assets that are considered sufficient to collect all amounts due in the event of deterioration in the customer s financial condition 
the remaining six loans of total potential problem loans are consumer residential construction loans that are well secured by property with residential real estate as the highest and best use and have an appraised value in excess of the carrying value of the loan 
the average relationship was  and the largest relationship was million 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 
a loan is determined to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if we expect to collect all amounts due  including past due interest 
we generally consider a period of delay in payment to include delinquency up to days 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 we measure impaired loans  i at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii at the observable market price  or iii at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses 
sfas no 
does not apply to larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as consumer installment  residential first and second mortgage loans  and credit card loans 
these loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans we consider impaired at december  totaled million compared to million at december  at december  and   and million  respectively  of total impaired loans were real estate collateral dependent 
real estate collateral dependent loans are measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
the valuation allowance for impaired loans was approximately  at december  and million at december  an impaired loan is charged off when the loan  or a portion thereof  is considered uncollectible 
deposits we use deposits as the primary source of funding of our loans 
we offer individuals and businesses a wide variety of deposit accounts 
these accounts include checking  savings  money market  and certificates of deposit and are obtained primarily from communities we serve 
we have no brokered deposits 
deposits totaled million as of december   increasing million or from the december  balance of million 
the increase in deposits is attributable to management s growth strategy  which includes significant marketing  promotion  and cross selling of existing customers into additional products 
continued successful marketing campaigns have maintained a strong mix of noninterest checking accounts  now  and money market accounts 
the following table details the average amount and the average rate paid for each category of deposits as of december average average average average average average dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate now accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits noninterest bearing demand deposits total deposits the following table provides the maturities of certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more at december dollars in thousands maturing in months or less over months through months over months through months over months core deposits represent deposits which we believe will not be affected by changes in interest rates  and therefore  will be retained regardless of the movement of interest rates 
we consider our core deposits to be all noninterest bearing  now  money market accounts less than  and saving deposits  as well as all time deposits less than  that mature in greater than one year 
as of december   our core deposits were million 
the remainder of our deposits could be susceptible to attrition due to interest rate movements 
borrowings our borrowings consist of short term promissory notes issued to certain qualified investors  short term and long term advances from the federal home loan bank at atlanta fhlb  a mortgage warehouse line of credit  long term repurchase agreements with callable options  a mortgage loan  a long term line of credit  and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
our short term promissory notes are in the form of commercial paper  which reprice daily and have maturities of days or less 
our advances from the fhlb may be in the form of short term or long term obligations 
short term advances have maturities for one year or less and can be paid without penalty 
long term borrowings through the fhlb have original maturities up to years and generally contain prepayment penalties 
long term borrowings consist of advances from the fhlb  a mortgage loan on our headquarters building  and a line of credit and totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the long term line of credit is used to fund finance maryland s lending business 
as of december   total borrowings under this line were million  up from million at december  in march of  we purchased our headquarters building and assumed the existing mortgage loan on the property 
as of december   the balance on the loan was million 
short term borrowings consist of short term promissory notes  short term advances from the fhlb  and a mortgage warehouse line of credit secured by certain loans held for sale 
short term borrowings increased million  from million at december  to million at december   reflecting increased borrowing required as growth in earning assets exceeded growth in deposits 
our repurchase agreements may be short term or long term  are priced at origination  and cannot be prepaid without penalty 
during the  we repaid million in repurchase agreements 
junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures as an ongoing part of our funding and capital planning  we issue trust preferred securities from statutory trusts  which are wholly owned by first mariner bancorp 
the proceeds from the sales of trust preferred securities  combined with our equity investment in these trusts  are exchanged for subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
we currently maintain seven of these trusts with aggregated debentures of million as of december  compared to as of december  on august   we formed mariner capital trust vii  which issued million of trust preferred securities at an initial variable interest rate of  where the interest rate will reset quarterly 
these debentures  which have a maturity date of september   may be redeemed at any time after september   and require quarterly distributions by the trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities 
on december   we formed mariner capital trust viii  which issued million of trust preferred securities at an initial fixed interest rate of 
the rate will remain fixed for a five year term  then convert to a variable rate  resetting quarterly 
these long term borrowings  which bear a maturity date of december   may be redeemed at any time after december   and require quarterly distributions by the trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities 
the notes under both trusts are subordinated to the prior payment of any other indebtedness of the company that  by its terms  is not similarly subordinated 
the trust preferred securities issued by both trusts qualify as tier capital  subject to regulatory guidelines that limit the amount included to an aggregate of of tier capital 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning our borrowings  repurchase agreements  and junior subordinated deferrable trust debentures 
capital resources stockholders equity increased million in to million as of december  from million as of december  accumulated other comprehensive loss deteriorated by million due to the decrease in market values of securities classified as available for sale  which occurred as increases in market interest rates further devalued the available for sale securities portfolio 
retained earnings grew by the retention of net income of million for common stock and additional paid in capital increased by million due to the sale of stock through the exercise of options and warrants million  and shares issued through the employee stock purchase plan  offset by stock repurchases by the company of million 
banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher defined credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
to date  we have provided for our capital requirements mainly through the funds we received from stock offerings and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the future  we may consider raising capital from time to time through an offering of common stock or other securities 
as reflected in the table below  both the company and the bank have exceeded their capital adequacy requirements as of december  and and met the requirement for well capitalized status under federal banking regulation 
we continually monitor our capital adequacy ratios to ensure that we exceed regulatory capital requirements 
we have a total of million in trust preferred securities which are eligible as capital for regulatory purposes 
as of december   million in trust preferred securities was included in tier capital and the remaining million was included in total capital 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning our trust preferred securities 
capital is classified as tier capital common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter 
our capital position is presented in the following table minimum to be well requirements capitalized under december  for capital prompt corrective adequacy purposes action provision regulatory capital ratios leverage consolidated bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated bank liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations  including lending commitments and contingencies  that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  as well as to meet current and planned expenditures 
these cash requirements are met on a daily basis through the inflow of deposit funds  and the maintenance of short term overnight investments  maturities and calls in our investment portfolio  and available lines of credit with the fhlb  which requires pledged collateral 
fluctuations in deposit and short term borrowing balances may be influenced by the interest rates paid  general consumer confidence and the overall economic environment 
there can be no assurances that deposit withdrawals and loan fundings will not exceed all available sources of liquidity on a short term basis 
such a situation would have an adverse effect on our ability to originate new loans and maintain reasonable loan and deposit interest rates  which would negatively impact earnings 
the borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines of credit collectively commitments and totaled million at december  historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments for real estate development and construction  which totaled million  or of the million  are generally short term in nature  satisfying cash requirements with principal repayments as construction properties financed are generally repaid with permanent financing 
available credit lines represent the unused portion of credit previously extended and available to the customer as long as there is no violation of material contractual conditions 
commitments to extend credit for residential mortgage loans of million  or of the million at december   generally expire within days 
commercial commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million  or of the million at december   generally do not extend for more than months 
consumer commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit of million  or of the million at december   are generally open ended 
at december   available home equity lines totaled million 
home equity credit lines generally extend for a period of years 
capital expenditures for various branch locations and equipment can be a significant use of liquidity 
as of december   we plan on expending approximately million in the next months on our premises and equipment 
customer withdrawals are also a principal use of liquidity  but are generally mitigated by growth in customer funding sources  such as deposits and short term borrowings 
while balances may fluctuate up and down in any given period  historically we have experienced a steady increase in total customer funding sources 
the bank s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents which are cash on hand or amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold  money market mutual funds  and interest bearing deposits  available for sale securities  loans held for sale  deposit accounts  and borrowings 
the levels of such sources are dependent on the bank s operating  financing  and investing activities at any given time 
we continue to primarily rely on core deposits from customers to provide stable and cost effective sources of funding to support our loan growth 
we also seek to augment such deposits with longer term and higher yielding certificates of deposit 
cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   have immediate availability to meet our short term funding needs 
our entire investment portfolio is classified as available for sale  is highly marketable  and available to meet our liquidity needs 
loans held for sale  which totaled million at december   are committed to be sold into the secondary market and generally are funded within days 
our residential real estate portfolio includes loans that are underwritten to secondary market criteria and provide us an additional source of liquidity 
additionally  our residential construction loan portfolio provides a source of liquidity as construction periods generally range from months  and these loans are subsequently financed with permanent first mortgages and sold into the secondary market 
our loan to deposit ratio stood at as of december  and at december  we also have the ability to utilize established credit as an additional source of liquidity 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb  must pledge certain loans and or investment securities to the fhlb before advances can be obtained 
under this line  the bank may borrow up to million 
other lines of credit available to the bank include a mortgage warehouse line of credit and secured and unsecured federal funds purchased lines  and totaled million at year end 
as of december   our remaining borrowing capacity on all of our credit lines totaled million based upon qualifying assets that we have not pledged to support existing borrowings 
we are not aware of any known trends  demands  commitments  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes in our liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of our earning assets and our funding sources 
the primary objective of our asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of our primary earnings component  net interest income 
our net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
we may attempt to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
however  imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time may be appropriate to mitigate risks from fee income subject to interest rate risk  such as mortgage banking activities 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between our assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
our management and our board of directors oversee the asset liability management function and meet periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies 
we evaluate the asset mix of the statement of financial condition continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  funding sources and liquidity 
our management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding our various funding sources and promotion of deposit products with desirable repricing or maturity characteristics 
in theory  we can diminish interest rate risk through maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on our interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of our funding sources 
accordingly  we strive to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with our expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  we may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swaps or caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
generally  we attempt to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities that is appropriate to minimize our overall interest rate risk  not just our net interest margin 
our interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in the following table 
our assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities that are based on prevailing prepayments assumptions  and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
the difference between our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   our interest sensitive assets exceeded our interest sensitive liabilities within a one year period by million or of total assets 
as of december   our interest rate sensitive assets exceeded our interest sensitive liabilities by million or of total assets 
the change in our interest rate sensitivity gap occurred primarily due to increases in our funding sources repricing in one year or less 
years days days one five or non dollars in thousands or less one year years sensitive total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits securities available for sale restricted stock investments loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts now accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowings and junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitive gap position period of assets cumulative of assets cumulative risk sensitive assets to risk sensitive liabilities while we monitor interest rate sensitivity reports  we primarily test our interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
we use earnings simulation models to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have on our net interest income and net income 
simulation analysis provides us with a more rigorous and dynamic measure of interest sensitivity 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  are included in the analysis 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change  and pricing features such as interest rate floors are incorporated 
our fee income produced by mortgage banking operations may also be impacted by changes in rates 
as long term rates increase  the volume of fixed rate mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market may decline and reduce our revenues generated by this line of business 
we attempt to structure our asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income by changes in market interest rates 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage interest rate risk so as to avoid significant adverse effects on net interest income 
at december   the simulation model provided the following profile of our interest rate risk measured over a one year time horizon  assuming a parallel shift in a yield curve based off the us dollar forward swap curve adjusted for certain pricing assumptions immediate rate change bp bp net interest income both of the above tools used to assess interest rate risk have strengths and weaknesses 
because the gap analysis reflects a static position at a single point in time  it is limited in quantifying the total impact of market rate changes which do not affect all earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally or simultaneously 
in addition  gap reports depict the existing structure  excluding exposure arising from new business 
while the simulation process is a powerful tool in analyzing interest rate sensitivity  many of the assumptions used in the process are highly qualitative and subjective  and are subject to the risk that past historical activity may not generate accurate predictions of the future 
the model also assumes parallel movements in interest rates  which means both short term and long term rates will change equally 
nonparallel changes in interest rates short term rates changing differently from long term rates could result in significant differences in projected income amounts when compared to parallel tests 
both measurement tools taken together  however  provide an effective evaluation of our exposure to changes in interest rates  enabling management to better control the volatility of earnings 
rate lock commitments we enter into rate lock commitments  under which we  through the mortgage banking segment  originate residential mortgage loans with interest rates determined prior to funding 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that we intend to sell in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from days to days 
for these rate lock commitments  we protect the company from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby we commit to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  we are not exposed to losses nor will we realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates unless there would be a failure to honor the rate lock commitment by the counterparty 
we mitigate counterparty risk by entering into forward delivery commitments with proven counterparties with whom we have significant previous experience and have performed significant due diligence 
at december   we had million in rate lock commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business 
these arrangements consist primarily of commitments to extend credit  lines of credit and letters of credit 
in addition  the company has certain contractual obligations 
credit commitments 
credit commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition to the contract 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
such lines do not represent future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will draw upon their lines in full at any time 
letters of credit are commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
outstanding loan commitments  unused lines of credit  and letters of credit were as follows at december  dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit unused lines of credit letters of credit our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is the contract amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
we are not aware of any accounting loss we would incur by funding our commitments 
contractual obligations 
first mariner has certain obligations to make future payments under contract 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are payments due by period less than after dollars in thousands total one year years years years certificates of deposit  and over borrowings and repurchase agreements annual rental commitments under non cancelable leases includes lease payments on our new headquarters location which we anticipate will be ready for occupancy july  however  no lease payments are required until the building is fully constructed  the timing of which is not known for certain and is beyond our control 
in january of  we entered into a strategy to sell and deliver certain residential mortgage loans on a mandatory basis rather than on best effort contracts and  accordingly  began to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in that portion of our pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale to protect our margin on the sale of loans 
we expect this hedging strategy will generally produce stable and consistent results  and profitability should generally increase as the cost of the hedge is more than offset by the increase in price realized on selling loans on a mandatory basis 
it is our intention to utilize instruments such as forward sale agreements whose change in value as interest rates change is expected to offset the change in value of its underlying mortgage pipeline based on expected closing ratios 
initially  we will be utilizing this strategy on approximately of our mortgage banking loan originations  with the option of expanding our coverage in the future 
utilizing this strategy  we will focus on trying to maintain stable profit margins with an emphasis on forecasting expected fallout to more precisely estimate our required hedge coverage ratio and minimize hedge costs 
by closely monitoring key factors such as product type  business units  progress or status of transactions  as well as changes in market interest rates since we committed a rate to the borrower  we will seek to quantify the optional component of each rate lock  and in turn  the aggregate rate lock pipeline 
by accurately evaluating these factors  we hope to be able to minimize the purchase of options and also stabilize gain on sale margins over different rate environments 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation may be expected to have an impact on our operating costs and thus on net income 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect our results of operations unless the fees we charge could be increased correspondingly 
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
we believe that the impact of inflation was not material for or recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity i exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services  or ii incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on an entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using accounting principles bulletin apb no 
and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
in april  the sec adopted a rule to amend the compliance date for sfas r 
under the new rule  companies may implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year instead of the statement s original implementation date of the next reporting period beginning after june  sfas r is now effective on january  for the company 
the company will transition to fair value based compensation using a modified version of the prospective application  which means the fair value based method prescribed under sfas r will apply to new awards  modification of previous awards  repurchases and cancellations after january  additionally  compensation cost for awards for which requisite service has not been rendered non vested options and stock grants that are outstanding as of january  must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of and or the periods after the adoption of sfas r 
the determination of compensation cost for awards granted prior to january  will be based on the same methods and on the same fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not previously adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and more broadly provides for exceptions regarding exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf released issue  meaning of other than temporary impairment  which addressed other than temporary impairment for certain debt and equity investments 
the recognition and measurement requirements of issue  and other disclosure requirements not already implemented  were effective for periods after june  in september  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delayed the effective date for certain measurement and recognition guidance during the period of delay until a final consensus is reached 
in june  the fasb staff issued an fsp that supersedes eitf and effectively reverts the guidance for other than temporary impairments to previously established literature 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
in the case of impracticability in retrospective application  the statement gives guidance as to the appropriate treatment of the change or correction 
the statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in june  the eitf released issue  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock to clarify the issue of an exception in issue issue contains an exception to its general requirements for evaluating whether  pursuant to sfas no 
 an embedded derivative indexed to a company s own stock would be classified as stockholders equity 
the exception applies to a conventional convertible debt instrument in which the holder may realize the value of the conversion option only by exercising the option and receiving all proceeds in a fixed number of shares or in the equivalent amount of cash at the discretion of the issuer 
issue provides for the retention of the exception as described in issue the issue requires that instruments that provide the holder with an option to convert into a fixed number of shares or an equivalent amount of cash at the issuer s discretion for which the ability to exercise the option feature is based on the passage of time or on a contingent event be considered conventional for purposes of applying issue convertible preferred stock having a mandatory redemption date may still qualify for the exception if the economic characteristics indicate that the instrument is more like debt than equity 
application of issue should be applied to new instruments entered into and or modified in periods beginning after june  in june  the eitf released issue  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
eitf issue requires leasehold improvements that are acquired in a business combination to be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the underlying asset  or a term that includes required lease periods and reasonably assured renewal periods 
other leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the underlying asset  or a term that includes required lease periods and reasonably assured renewal periods  as of the date on which the leasehold improvements are purchased 
financial review for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million or per diluted share  an increase of from net income of million income or per diluted share in our gross revenue net interest income and noninterest income increased million while our noninterest expenses  the provision for credit losses and income taxes increased by million
