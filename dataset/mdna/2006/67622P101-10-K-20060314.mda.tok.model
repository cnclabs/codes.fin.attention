there are no minimum required contributions in however  we may elect to make voluntary contributions 
see critical accounting estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared with at december  the decrease in our ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december   resulted primarily from the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in  compared with resulting from our share repurchases and debt repayments

in  we used million of cash for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock and used million of cash to reduce short term borrowings and long term debt 
on september   standard poor s rating services downgraded our corporate credit rating to b 
the downgrade increases the reporting requirements under our receivable sale agreement and increases the annual cost of that facility by less than million

obligations under operating leases are shown in the contractual obligations section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financing arrangements our debt structure consists of credit agreements  note agreements  and other borrowings as follows 
for more information  see contractual obligations and disclosures of financial market risks in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
credit agreements on june   we entered into a loan and security agreement for a new revolving credit facility 
the new revolver replaced our previous revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire on june  the maximum aggregate borrowing amount under the new facility is equal to the lesser of i a percentage of the value of certain eligible inventory less certain reserves or ii million 
letters of credit may be issued under the revolver up to a maximum limit of million 
the combined sum of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under the revolver may not exceed the maximum aggregate borrowing amount 
the outstanding balance under the new revolver was million at december  letters of credit issued under the revolver totaled million as of december  as of december   our maximum aggregate borrowing amount was million 
the minimum and maximum amounts of short term borrowings outstanding were zero and million during the year ended december   and million and million during the year ended december  the average amounts of short term borrowings outstanding during the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average annual interest rates for these borrowings were for and for the activity in reflects the addition of two million term loan facilities in september to fund incremental contributions to our pension plans and to decrease our accounts receivable financing 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we added two million floating rate term loans 
on october   we repaid the two million and two million term loans with the proceeds from the sale 
borrowings under the revolver bear interest at rates based on either the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
margins are applied to our borrowing rates and letters of credit fees under the revolver depending on our average excess availability 
fees on letters of credit issued under the revolver were charged at a weighted average rate of 
in addition  we are also charged an unused line fee of 
on the amount by which the maximum credit of million exceeds our average daily outstanding borrowings and letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolver are secured by a lien on substantially all of our inventory and related proceeds 
the revolving loan and security agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing including a monthly calculation of excess borrowing availability and reporting compliance 
covenants in the revolver agreement restrict the amount of letters of credit that may be issued  dividend distributions and other uses of cash if excess availability is less than million 
at december   our excess availability totaled million and we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolver agreement 
the revolver expires on june  timber notes in october  we sold our timberlands as part of the sale 
in exchange for the timberlands  we received installment timber notes in the amount of billion which were credit enhanced with guarantees 
the guarantees were issued by financial institutions and were secured by the pledge of underlying collateral notes 
subsequently  in december  we completed a securitization transaction in which we transferred our interest in the timber installment notes receivable to wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiaries that were designated to be qualifying special purpose entities the omxqs 
the omxqs pledged the timber installment notes receivable and related guarantees and issued securitization notes in the amount of billion 
recourse on the securitization notes is limited to the pledged timber notes receivable 
the securitization notes are year non amortizing and were issued in two equal million tranches paying interest of and  respectively 
as a result of these transactions  officemax received billion in cash from the omxq s  and over years will earn approximately million per year in interest income on the timber installment notes receivable and incur interest expense of approximately million per year on the securitization notes 
the pledged timber installment notes receivable and nonrecourse securitization notes will mature in and  respectively 
the securitization notes have an initial term that is approximately three months shorter than the installment notes 
the company expects to refinance its ownership of the installment notes in with a short term secured borrowing to bridge the period from initial maturity of the securitization notes to the maturity of the installment notes 
the guidance related to the accounting for securitization transactions is complex and open to interpretation 
the original entities issuing the credit enhanced timber installment notes to officemax are variable interest entities the vie s under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the holders of the timber installment notes the omxq s are considered to be the primary beneficiaries  and therefore  the vie s are required to be consolidated with the omxqs  which are also the issuers of the securitization notes 
although we believe an argument can be made that the consolidation of the vie s as a result of this transaction does not disqualify the omxqs from being qualified special purpose entities  as described in fasb statement no  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we have concluded that consolidating the vie s does disqualify the omxqs from meeting this guidance 
as a result  the accounts of the omxqs have been consolidated into our financial statements 
the effect of our consolidation of the omxqs is that the securitization transaction is treated as a financing  and both the timber notes receivable and the securitization notes payable are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
note agreements in august  we issued million of medium term notes due in the proceeds of the notes were used for general corporate purposes 
on november   we purchased million of these notes pursuant to a tender offer for these securities 
in october  we issued million of senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in net proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  to provide cash for the officemax  inc transaction and for other general corporate purposes 
at the time of issuance  the senior note indentures contained a number of restrictive covenants  substantially all of which have been eliminated through the execution of supplemental indentures and replaced with covenants found in the base indentures that are applicable to our medium term notes and other public debt 
those covenants include a limitation on mergers and similar transactions  a restriction on secured transactions involving principal properties  as defined  and a restriction on sale and leaseback transactions involving principal properties 
on november   we repurchased approximately million of the senior notes and received the requisite consents to adopt amendments to the indenture pursuant to a tender offer for these securities 
as a result  the company and the trustee executed a sixth supplemental indenture which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants  certain events of default and related provisions  and replaced them with the covenants from our other public debt 
on december   both moody s investors service  inc  and standard poor s rating services upgraded the credit rating on our senior notes to investment grade 
the upgrades were the result of actions the company undertook to collateralize the notes by granting the noteholders a security interest in million in principal amount of general electric capital and bank of america corp 
notes maturing in the pledged instruments 
these pledged instruments are reflected as restricted investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of these ratings upgrades  the original senior note covenants were replaced with the covenants found in our other public debt 
during  we purchased and cancelled million of the senior notes 
as a result  million of the pledged instruments were released from the security interest granted to the note holders and were sold in the remaining balance of these pledged instruments continue to be subject to the security interest  and are reflected as restricted investments in our consolidated balance sheet at december  adjustable conversion rate equity securities aces in december  we issued  adjustable conversion rate equity security units aces to the public at an aggregate offering price of million 
the units traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bep 
at the time of issuance  there were two components of each unit 
investors received a preferred security issued by boise cascade trust i the trust  a statutory business trust whose common securities were owned by the company  with a liquidation amount of these preferred securities were mandatorily redeemable in december investors also entered into a contract to purchase of common shares of the company  subject to a collar arrangement 
the trust used the proceeds from the offering to purchase debentures issued by boise cascade corporation now officemax incorporated 
these debentures were senior  unsecured obligations and had a scheduled maturity in december on september   we dissolved the trust and distributed the debentures to the unit holders in exchange for their preferred securities 
also on that date  the remarketing of million of these debentures was completed 
in connection with the remarketing  the interest rate on the debentures was reset to over the average of the interbank offered rates for three month libor 
the first interest payment on the debentures at the reset rate was made on december   at a rate of per annum 
on november   we repurchased million of these debentures pursuant to an offer to purchase these securities 
we made an open market purchase of an additional million of the debentures in december the remaining million of the debentures were repurchased in february on december   holders of our adjustable conversion rate equity security units received of our common shares upon settlement of each purchase contract  resulting in the issuance of a total of  shares 
we received per unit  or million  as a result of the settlement of the purchase contracts 
other during  we agreed to enter into a million sale leaseback of equipment at our integrated wood polymer building materials facility near elma  washington 
the sale leaseback has a base term of seven years and an interest rate of  was accounted for as a financing arrangement  and is included in long term debt  less current portion in our consolidated balance sheet 
the outstanding balance at december  of this obligation was million 
in  we terminated this sale leaseback agreement as part of our decision to cease operations at this facility 
as of december   we had million of debentures that are due in the debentures contain a provision under which  in the event of the occurrence of both a designated event  as defined generally a change of control or a major distribution of assets and a subsequent rating decline  as defined  the holders of these securities may require the company to redeem the securities 
previously  officemax guaranteed the debt used to fund our employee stock ownership plan esop that was part of the savings and supplemental retirement plan for our us salaried employees 
the debt was repaid in we have guaranteed tax indemnities on the esop debt 
although the debt was paid  under these indemnities  we would be required to pay additional amounts to the debt holders if the interest payments on the debt were determined to be taxable 
any amounts paid under this tax indemnification would be dependent upon future tax rulings and assessments by the internal revenue service and are not quantifiable at this time 
cash paid for interest cash payments for interest  net of interest capitalized  were million in  million in and million in the decline in payments made in relative to was due to the repayment of outstanding debt in the fourth quarter of using a portion of the proceeds from the sale 
the level of payments made in increased over due to higher debt levels during most of related to additional borrowings to provide cash for the officemax  inc acquisition 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the amounts we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period thereafter total millions debt long term debt  including current portion a c timber notes securitized   short term borrowings operating leases b e  purchase obligations other long term liabilities d a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our note agreements  revenue bonds and credit agreements 
these borrowings are further described in note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
we lease our retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
some of our retail store leases require percentage rentals on sales above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
these minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
c the current portion of these liabilities is also included 
d our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of liabilities associated with our retirement and benefit plans and million of other long term liabilities 
these amounts have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain 
e lease obligations for facility closures are included in operating leases 
in accordance with an amended and restated joint venture agreement  the minority owner of our subsidiary in mexico  officemax de mexico  can elect to put its remaining interest in the subsidiary to officemax if earnings targets are achieved 
at december  and throughout  officemax de mexico had met these earnings targets 
these earnings targets are calculated quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis 
accordingly  the targets can be achieved in one quarter but not in the next 
if the earnings targets are achieved and the minority owner elects to put its ownership interest  the purchase price would be equal to fair value  calculated based on both the subsidiary s earnings for the last four quarters before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  and the current market multiples of similar companies 
the fair value purchase price in is estimated at to million 
this contingent obligation is not included in the table above 
in addition to the contractual obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these contracts  however  are either not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet activities and guarantees on june   we entered into a third amended and restated receivables sale agreement with a group of lenders 
under this program  we sell fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of accounts receivable 
we account for this sales program under fasb statement  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we entered into this program to provide us funding at rates favorable to our other borrowing arrangements 
a portion of our retained interest is subordinate to the interests of the bank affiliates  providing them credit support if the receivables become uncollectible 
the anticipated impact of the credit support is reflected in our allowance for uncollectible receivables 
the amount of available proceeds under this program is subject to change based on the level of eligible receivables  restrictions on concentrations of receivables and the historical performance of the receivables 
the proceeds available to us may not exceed million under our current agreements 
sold accounts receivable are excluded from receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in our consolidated balance sheet compared with million excluded at december  the portion of fractional ownership that we retain is included in receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
the receivables sale agreement will expire june  when the current program expires  none of the parties are obligated to renew the arrangement 
our experience over the last five years  however  has been that the parties do renew the arrangement with minimal alterations 
if the program were not renewed  we would seek replacement funding from alternative funding sources 
use of those sources  however  might result in an increase in our interest expense and an increase in both liabilities and assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
guarantees note  commitments and guarantees  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k describes the nature of our guarantees  including the approximate terms of the guarantees  how the guarantees arose  the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make 
inflationary and seasonal influences except for the impact of recent increases in energy costs  we believe that neither inflation nor deflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
the company s business is seasonal  with officemax  retail showing a more pronounced seasonal trend than officemax  contract 
sales in the second quarter and summer months are historically the slowest of the year 
sales are stronger during the first  third and fourth quarters that include the important new year office supply restocking month of january  the back to school period and the holiday selling season  respectively 
disclosures of financial market risks our debt is predominantly fixed rate 
at december   the estimated current market value of our debt  based on quoted market prices when available or then current interest rates for similar obligations with like maturities  including the timber notes  was approximately million less than the amount of debt reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our other financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  receivables and short term borrowings are the same as their carrying values 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any significant concentration of credit risks 
concentration of credit risks with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the wide variety of vendors  customers and channels to and through which our products are sourced and sold  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas 
changes in interest and currency rates expose the company to financial market risk 
we occasionally use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  rate hedge agreements  forward purchase contracts and forward exchange contracts  to hedge underlying debt obligations or anticipated transactions 
we do not use them for trading purposes 
for qualifying hedges  the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap or underlying debt 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and recognized in income as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occur 
unrealized gains and losses on all other forward exchange contracts are included in current period net income loss 
at december   we were not a party to any significant derivative financial instruments other than the additional consideration agreement described below 
interest rate swaps on october   officemax and one of its subsidiaries  each entered into an interest rate swap contract with an affiliate of goldman  sachs co 
the contracts were entered into in order to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the issuance of debt securities by the omxq s in connection with the timber notes received in the sale 
the company paid million to settle the contracts on december   in conjunction with the issuance of the securitized timber notes 
the settlement amount reflected the effect of a decrease in interest rates during the period the swaps were outstanding 
in april and may  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each 
these swaps converted million of fixed rate debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately for the april swap and for the may swap 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
this swap converted million of fixed rate debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately 
in september  we settled the swaps in anticipation of tendering for the underlying debt instruments 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each  one that matured in february and one that matured in february in november  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that matured in november the swaps hedged the variable cash flow risk from the variable interest payments on million of our libor based debt in and utility swaps effective january  we entered into two electricity swaps that converted and megawatts of usage per hour to a fixed price 
effective with the date of the sale  these swaps were assumed by boise cascade  llc in november  we entered into a natural gas swap to hedge the variable cash flow risk on  mmbtu per day of natural gas usage to a fixed price 
the swap expired in march in april  we entered into a natural gas swap to hedge the variable cash flow risk on  mmbtu of gas allocated on a monthly basis to a fixed price 
the swap expired in october additional consideration agreement pursuant to an additional consideration agreement between officemax and boise cascade  llc related to the sale  we may be required to make substantial cash payments to  or receive substantial cash payments from  boise cascade  llc under the additional consideration agreement  the sale proceeds may be adjusted upward or downward based on paper prices during the six years following the closing date  subject to annual and aggregate caps 
under the terms of the agreement  neither party will be obligated to make a payment in excess of million in any one year 
payments by either party are also subject to an aggregate cap of million that declines to million in the fifth year and million in the sixth year 
in connection with recording the sale in  we calculated our projected future obligation under the additional consideration agreement and accrued million in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we calculated the million based on the net present value of weighted average expected payments using industry paper price projections 
we record the changes in the fair value of this obligation in our net income loss in the period they occur 
the change in fair value of this obligation in resulted in expense of million and is reflected in our consolidated statement of income loss

for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for obligations with variable interest rates  the table sets forth payout amounts based on current rates and does not attempt to project future rates 
estimated future cash payments under the terms of the additional consideration agreement  included in the table below  are based on weighted average expected payments using industry paper price projections

we can be found liable under these laws if we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such substances 
in some cases  this liability may exceed the value of the property itself 
in connection with the sale  environmental liabilities that relate to the operation of the paper and forest products assets prior to the closing of the sale continue to be officemax liabilities 
we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar federal and state laws  or have received a claim from a private party  with respect to active sites where hazardous substances or other contaminants are or may be located 
all active sites relate to operations either no longer owned by the company or unrelated to its ongoing operations 
in most cases  we are one of many potentially responsible parties  and our alleged contribution to these sites is relatively minor 
for sites where a range of potential liability can be determined  we have established appropriate reserves 
we believe we have minimal or no responsibility with regard to several other sites 
we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of the total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups 
based on our investigations  our experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances  the fact that expenditures will  in many cases  be incurred over extended periods of time  and the number of solvent potentially responsible parties  we do not believe that the known actual and potential response costs will  in the aggregate  materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
these estimates require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our current critical accounting estimates are as follows vendor rebates and allowances we participate in various cooperative advertising and other marketing programs with our vendors 
we also participate in volume purchase rebate programs  some of which provide for tiered rebates based on defined levels of purchase volume 
these arrangements enable us to receive reimbursement for costs incurred to promote the sale of vendor products  or to earn rebates that reduce the cost of merchandise purchased 
vendor rebates and allowances are accrued as earned 
rebates and allowances received as a result of attaining defined purchase levels are accrued over the incentive period based on the terms of the vendor arrangement and estimates of qualifying purchases during the rebate program period 
these estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted for changes in anticipated product sales and expected purchase levels 
volume based rebates and allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in the cost of merchandise inventories and are included in operations as a reduction in materials  labor and other operating expenses in the period the related product is sold 
amounts received under other promotional programs are generally event based and are recognized at the time of the event as a reduction of cost of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate  based on the nature of the promotion and the terms of the vendor agreement 
advertising allowances that represent reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as a reduction of selling and distribution expenses in the period the expense is incurred 
amounts owed to us under these arrangements are subject to credit risk 
in addition  the terms of the contracts covering these programs can be complex and subject to interpretation  which can potentially result in disputes 
we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts and to cover disputes in the event that our interpretation of the contract terms differ from our vendors and our vendors seek to recover some of the consideration from us 
these allowances are based on the current financial condition of our vendors  specific information regarding disputes and historical experience 
if we used different assumptions to estimate the amount of vendor receivables that will not be collected due to either credit default or a dispute regarding the amounts owed  our calculated allowance would be different and the difference could be material 
in addition  if actual losses are different than those estimated  adjustments to the recorded allowance may be required 
merchandise inventories inventories consist of office products merchandise and are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value 
we estimate the realizable value of inventory using assumptions about future demand  market conditions and product obsolescence 
if the estimated realizable value is less than cost  the inventory value is reduced to its estimated realizable value 
if expectations regarding future demand and market conditions are inaccurate or unexpected changes in technology or other factors affect demand  we could be exposed to additional losses 
throughout the year  we perform physical inventory counts at all of our locations 
for periods subsequent to each location s last physical inventory count  an allowance for estimated shrinkage is provided based on historical shrink results and current business trends 
if actual losses as a result of inventory shrinkage are different than management s estimates  adjustments to the allowance for inventory shrinkage may be required 
pensions during the period of january through october   some of our employees were covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
effective july   we spun off the portion of each plan attributable to active employees in the paper and forest products businesses 
effective october   under the terms of the asset purchase agreement with affiliates of boise cascade  llc  we transferred sponsorship of the spun off plans to boise cascade  llc  and only those terminated vested employees and retirees whose employment with us ended on or before july   and some active officemax  contract employees were covered under the plans remaining with us 
the officemax  retail employees  among others  never participated in the pension plans 
the salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants on november   and on december   the benefits of officemax  contract participants were frozen with one additional year of service provided to active officemax  contract employees on january   at a reduced crediting rate 
as a result of the closure  freeze and spin off  our annual pension expense and contributions to the plans going forward will be less than the amounts included in prior periods 
we account for pension expense in accordance with fasb statement  employer s accounting for pensions 
this statement requires us to calculate our pension expense and liabilities using actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate assumption and a long term asset return assumption 
we base our discount rate assumption on the rates of return on high quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
we base our long term asset return assumption on the average rate of earnings expected on invested funds 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  based on the performance of plan assets  actuarial valuations and changes in interest rates  and the effect on our financial position and results of operations could be material 
for  our discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost was  and our expected return on plan assets was 
using these assumptions  our pension expense will be approximately million 
if we were to decrease our estimated discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
if we were to increase our discount rate assumption used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit cost to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
environmental remediation we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
we account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
we record liabilities on an undiscounted basis when assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate our environmental liabilities based on various assumptions and judgments  as we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties or the amount of time necessary to complete any remediation 
in making these judgments and assumptions  we consider  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites  information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors and our historical experience at other sites that are judged to be comparable 
due to the number of uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments and the effects of changes in governmental regulation and environmental technologies  the precision of the resulting estimates of the related liabilities is subject to uncertainty 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to our environmental liabilities 
as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change 
environmental liabilities that relate to the operation of the paper and forest products assets prior to the closing of the sale continue to be liabilities of officemax  in addition to the liabilities related to the active sites referenced in note  legal proceedings and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
goodwill impairment fasb statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
in assessing impairment  the statement requires us to make estimates of the fair values of our reporting units 
if we determine the fair values are less than the carrying amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  we must recognize an impairment in our financial statements 
at december   we had billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
of the billion  million and million were recorded in our officemax  contract and officemax  retail segments  respectively 
the company completed its annual assessment in accordance with the provisions of the standard in the first quarters of and  and concluded there was no impairment 
the company completed an additional assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill in the officemax  retail segment in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the development of management s plan to close retail stores in  and concluded there was no impairment 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units based upon discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our estimated average cost of funds 
differences in assumptions used in projecting future operating cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate could have a significant impact on the determination of impairment amounts 
in estimating future cash flows  we used our internal budgets and operating plans  which include assumptions about retail store openings and closures  the consolidation of our distribution networks and improvements in our supply chain 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances on these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
recently issued or newly adopted accounting standards following are summaries of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may become applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in the future 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on exchanges of employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion and its related implementation guidance 
it eliminates an entity s ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed in apb  which was permitted under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
the statement requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will also require the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as required under current guidance 
the new requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption  however total cash flow will remain unchanged from that which would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company will implement the new standard beginning with the first quarter of fiscal using the statement s modified prospective application method 
while we are still in the process of determining the impact of applying sfas no 
r  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on our financial position or have a significant impact on reported income  earnings per share or cash flows because we adopted sfas no 
on january  however  depending on the model used to calculate stock based compensation expense in the future  model assumptions  actual participant forfeitures and certain other requirements of sfas no 
r  our historical level of stock based compensation expense may not be indicative of the stock based compensation expense that will be recognized in future financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  amends apb opinion no 
and requires retrospective application of most changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so 
changes in accounting estimates continue to be applied prospectively  and the correction of an error continues to require restatement of previously issued financial statements 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will be required to adopt the new rules for the year ending in december sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  amends the guidance in fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host as long as the entire instrument is valued on a fair value basis 
this statement also clarifies other specific sfas no 
and sfas no 
related issues 
this statement will generally be effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we have not yet determined the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements
