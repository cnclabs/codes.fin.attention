item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a reconciliation of ffo to net income applicable to common shareholders 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  the overall economy and the travel industry  including lodging  continued to be strong 
we believe the lodging industry is in the midst of the fundamentally strong portion of a typical multi year up cycle  assuming a normal economic growth period 
with a strong balance sheet and high quality hotel portfolio  the company was able to take advantage of this environment  significantly increasing room revenue per available room revpar  funds from operations ffo  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company s revenues come primarily from hotel operating revenues from its hotels 
hotel operating revenues include room revenue  food and beverage revenue and other ancillary revenue such as golf revenue at two golf resorts and telephone and parking revenue 
for  the company had net income of million  or per diluted share 
ffo was million  or per diluted share unit and ebitda was million 
revpar was 
we consider revpar and ebitda to be key measures of the performance of the individual hotels 
revpar for the total portfolio increased for the revpar increase is primarily attributable to an average daily rate adr increase of to  while occupancy throughout the portfolio improved by to 
the company s ebitda increased due to increased lodging demand  aggressive asset management and property acquisitions 
the company s hotel portfolio ebitda increased million due to higher adr  occupancy and margin improvements 
the company uses revpar  ebitda  ffo and adr as measures to evaluate the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions to determine each portfolio hotel s contribution or acquisition hotel s potential contribution toward reaching the company s goal of maintaining a reliable stream of income and moderate growth to shareholders 
the company invests in capital improvements throughout the portfolio to continue to increase the competitiveness of its hotels and improve their financial performance 
the company actively seeks to acquire new hotel properties that meet its investment criteria 
however  due to a high level of competitive capital resources  the company continues to face significant competition for acquisitions that meet its investment criteria 
please refer to non gaap financial measures below for a detailed discussion of the company s use of ffo and ebitda and a reconciliation of ffo and ebitda to net income  a gaap measurement 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and the company s other consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
for example  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated contingent lease termination expense of million  million and zero for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the company s litigation with meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings 
additionally  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated liability of million related to the company s litigation with meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings  an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an estimated deferred tax asset of million as of december  management believes that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized and has determined that no valuation allowance is required 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses

these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income

nevertheless  both the leisure traveler and the business traveler  group and transient  continued to be price sensitive in and utilized an aggressive negotiation posture and internet sites to shop for the lowest rates 
additionally  the business was more competitive because transient guests tended to book their rooms closer to their time of stay than in the past  and transient rooms had prices lower than they otherwise would have

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most real estate industry investors consider ffo and ebitda to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
the white paper on ffo approved by nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo consistent with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
with respect to ffo  the company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
with respect to ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization  and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  even though ebitda also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
neither ffo nor ebitda represents cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither ffo nor ebitda is a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is ffo or ebitda indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
neither measurement reflects cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
to compensate for this  management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the company s operating performance

the company s senior unsecured credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to debt service coverage  net worth and total funded indebtedness and contains financial covenants that  assuming no continuing defaults  allow the company to make shareholder distributions 
there are currently no other contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the operating partnership 
similarly  lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
payments to the operating partnership are required pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and the operating partnership relating to the properties owned by the operating partnership and leased by lhl 
except for the security deposits required under the participating leases for the two hotels not leased by lhl  the lessees obligations under the participating leases are unsecured and the lessees abilities to make rent payments to the operating partnership  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessees abilities to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lockouts that may impact operating performance  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings and military actions such as the war in iraq  and sars  pandemics or other medical events which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel  and adverse affects of weak general and local economic conditions 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues and therefore adversely affect the lessees of the company s hotels and their ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and therefore impact the company s liquidity

on february   the washington grande hotel formerly the holiday inn downtown was closed for renovations 
the company plans to invest over million in a renovation and repositioning similar to those performed on the company s dc urban collection purchased in march after completion of the renovation and repositioning in  the hotel will be operated as a luxury high style  independent hotel 
inflation the company s revenues come primarily from its pro rata share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the participating leases and the lhl hotel operating revenues  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the underlying hotels revenues 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
the hotel operators can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and hotel operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate 
the company s expenses primarily real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  administrative expenses and lhl hotel operating expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for energy costs  property and casualty insurance  liability insurance  property tax rates  employee benefits  and some wages  which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation  and except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately including the company s million pro rata portion of indebtedness relating to the company s joint venture investment in the chicago marriott downtown hotel of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company utilizes a variety of borrowings including lines of credit and medium and long term financings 
to reduce overall interest cost  the company uses interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is usually lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing as of each valuation date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including mortgage obligations  bonds  lines of credit and an interest rate swap 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the debt securing the indianapolis marriott downtown has been included in fixed rate debt because the company has an interest rate swap in place which is not used for trading purposes and effectively fixes the interest rate on the debt 
dollars in million thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest variable rate debt weighted average interest total the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year  including annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
the company s ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the company employs interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
on february   the company entered into a three year fixed interest rate swap that fixes the libor at for million of the company s mortgage loan secured by the indianapolis hotel and therefore fixes the mortgage rate at 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring the company s variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   approximately million of the company s aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness  including the company s million pro rata portion of indebtedness relating to the company s joint venture investment in the chicago marriott downtown hotel  was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate long term debt increase by  the increase in interest expense on the variable long term rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest on the variable rate long term debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate long term debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under the company s variable rate debt remains at million  the balance at december
