table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we completed with a increase in our hotel revenue per available room  or revpar  compared to this was the second year of revpar increases following an unprecedented consecutive three year decline in revpar that we had experienced prior to the fundamentals of the lodging industry appear to be strong  as evidenced by the national trend of increased revpar and increases in average daily room rates  or adr  which represent a major portion of the increase in revpar 
the increase in adr also resulted in a basis point increase in hotel earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  margin at our hotels 
during  we reduced our debt outstanding by million with the proceeds of asset sales  extinguishment of debt through the transfer of hotels to their non recourse mortgage holder and the use of cash on hand 
through the issuance of million of new series c redeemable preferred stock  we also retired all million of our series b redeemable preferred stock 
of the hotels previously identified for sale at december   we sold during for gross sale proceeds of million and surrendered eight limited service hotels  owned by a consolidated joint venture  to their non recourse mortgage holder for extinguishment of million in debt 
under the management agreements entered into with intercontinental hotels group  or ihg  in and amended in  we were obligated to reinvest the net proceeds from the sale of ihg managed hotels in other ihg managed hotels or pay substantial liquidated damages to ihg 
this potential exposure to liquidated damages made it impractical to sell ihg managed hotels 
in january  we executed an agreement modifying our management agreements covering our hotels managed by ihg 
this agreement eliminated any potential liquidated damages and reinvestment requirement with respect to hotels previously sold  ihg managed hotels now identified for sale and one crowne plaza hotel to be converted to another brand 
we are now able to sell hotels that we have determined to be non strategic  which include all of our holiday inn hotels in secondary and tertiary markets and hotels in markets where we have an excess concentration of hotels  such as texas and atlanta  georgia 
as a result of our decision to seek to sell certain hotels  we determined that it was more likely than not that they would be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life  triggering an impairment charge of million  which was recorded as of december  with respect to ihg managed hotels  three hotels not managed by ihg and two ihg managed hotels that we had previously designated as non strategic

for the year  our revpar increased from to 
the increase in revpar consisted of a increase in occupancy to and a increase in adr 
we attribute the increase in revpar largely to a nationwide lodging industry recovery and improvements from some major capital projects completed in and in  a significant portion of the improvement in revpar came from an increase in adr 
we expect this trend of increasing revpar to continue in and further believe that improvements in adr will continue to be a significant portion of the growth in revpar 
this is significant to the lodging industry  because increases in room rate generally result in increases in hotel ebitda margins 
we have seen a firming of hotel ebitda margin at our hotels  which improved from in to in  and we expect to see further improvements in as adr continues to be a significant factor in revpar improvement 
we are focused on working with our brand managers to control the expense creep that generally occurs during the early years of a lodging industry recovery  to continue to improve our hotel ebitda margins 

table of contents sale of non strategic hotels under the management agreements entered into with ihg in and amended in  we were obligated to reinvest the net proceeds from the sale of ihg managed hotels in other ihg managed hotels or pay substantial liquidated damages to ihg 
this potential exposure to liquidated damages made it impractical to sell ihg managed hotels 
in january  we executed an agreement modifying our management agreements covering our hotels managed by ihg 
this agreement eliminates any potential liquidated damages or reinvestment requirement with respect to hotels previously sold  ihg managed hotels now identified for sale and one crowne plaza hotel to be converted to another brand 
we can now seek to sell hotels that we have deemed non strategic  which include all of our holiday inn hotels in secondary and tertiary markets and hotels in markets where we have an excess concentration of hotels  such as texas and atlanta  georgia 
we began negotiating the amendment to our ihg management agreements in in october  our audit committee conditionally approved an impairment charge on certain hotels  if and only if a definitive agreement with ihg was reached 
we provided an update on the negotiations with ihg to our executive committee of the board of directors in december  and at that time concluded that if a definitive agreement could be finalized  a material impairment charge would be necessary 
we finalized the definitive agreement with ihg in january  which enables us to sell certain ihg managed hotels without liquidated damages or reinvestment requirements and removed the liquidated damage and reinvestment requirement for hotels already sold 
as a result of the agreement  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain hotels would be sold significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life  triggering an impairment charge of million  which was recorded as of december  with respect to ihg managed hotels  three hotels not managed by ihg and two ihg managed hotels that we had previously designated as non strategic 
in connection with this agreement with ihg  seven hotels were sold to hospitality properties trust  or hpt  in january  for million 
these hotels  which will continue to be managed by ihg  consisted of five crowne plaza hotels  one holiday inn hotel and one staybridge suites hotel 
six of these hotels are located in markets where we had an excess concentration of hotels 
when testing for recoverability we generally use historical and projected cash flows over the expected hold period 
when determining fair value for purposes of determining impairment we use a combination of historical and projected cash flows and other available market information  such as recent sales prices for similar assets in specific markets 
the estimated cash flows used to test for recoverability are undiscounted while the cash flows used for determining fair values are discounted using a reasonable capitalization rate  or as earlier noted based on the local market conditions using recent sales of similar assets 
at december   we had hotels designated as non strategic  substantially all of which we intend to sell in and eight of these hotels were sold in january these hotels are located primarily in secondary and tertiary markets  and include hotels in texas and atlanta  georgia  where we had an excess concentration of hotels 
our repositioning strategy includes the sale of seven hotels previously identified as non strategic  including five ihg managed hotels  one of which was sold in january the sale of additional ihg managed hotels  including the seven hotels sold to hpt in january the sale of three additional hotels not managed by ihg 
total proceeds from hotel sales are expected to be between and million representing an ebitda multiple of between and times hotel ebitda 
the crowne plaza in san francisco at union square will be converted to another brand by the end of although the non strategic hotels represent of our rooms at december   they only represent of our hotel ebitda 
the hotels to be sold have significantly lower revpar and hotel ebitda margins than our core hotels 
following the sale of the non strategic hotels  we will have significantly lower exposure to markets with low barriers to entry  such as atlanta  dallas  houston and omaha  and will be more geographically diverse with no market contributing more than of ebitda 

table of contents refined investment strategy the completion of the agreement with ihg enables us to sell our non strategic hotels and use the proceeds to reduce debt and invest in high return on investment capital projects at our remaining core hotels 
we currently plan on spending between million and million on hotel capital improvements in as we focus on improving our core portfolio through renovations and repositionings  we believe our portfolio will be positioned to have above average growth 
any future acquisition efforts will be focused on higher quality hotels in markets with significant barriers to entry  such as central business districts and resort locations 
hotel brand and market segment will be secondary concerns when we are considering investment opportunities 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to a loss of million in we had a loss from continuing operations of million compared to a prior year loss of million 
contributing to loss from continuing operations were impairment charges of million  million related to the early retirement of debt and million in losses from hurricanes 
total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar compared to the increase in revpar came from increases in both adr and occupancy and represents increases in all of our top markets 
the lodging industry nationwide continues to experience increased demand  but there have been only limited increases in room supply leading to strong improvements in revpar in most markets 
in  of our increased revpar was attributed to increases in adr 
increased adr typically improves hotel ebitda margin because the hotels are receiving more revenue for each guest 
for  our hotel ebitda margin improved basis points over total operating expenses increased by million but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
these costs are directly related to the number of hotel guests and should improve as a percentage of total revenue as rates increase 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased million compared to  and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the slight increase as a percentage of total revenue was entirely related to increased utility expenses  and other costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue 
management and franchise fees increased million compared to and remained essentially the same as a percentage of total revenue 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue was from property tax expense  percentage lease expense and general liability insurance 
property tax expenses increased in largely because of credits for prior year tax appeals that were recorded in percentage lease expense is computed as a percentage of hotel revenues in excess of a base rent 
therefore  as revenues increase  percentage rent expense increases at a faster rate 
general liability insurance reflects the nationwide trend of increases in rates 
corporate expenses increased by million compared to and remained essentially flat as a percentage of total revenue 
depreciation expense increased by million compared to the increase in depreciation expense reflects the large capital expenditures spent in and 
table of contents net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding during our average outstanding debt decreased by million in compared to during we retired million of senior notes and issued million of senior notes and mortgage debt 
in  we further reduced our outstanding debt by million 
in  we recorded impairment charges  under the provisions of sfas  of million  million of which was included in continuing operations at december  and the remainder was included in discontinued operations 
the charges primarily related to our decision to designate as non strategic and sell an additional hotels  in connection with the negotiation of the amendment to our ihg management agreements 
we also recorded impairment charges with respect to hotels previously designated as non strategic principally because of revised estimates of fair value 
in  we incurred hurricane losses of million compared to hurricane losses of million incurred in the hurricane losses for both years represent our insurance deductibles and our best estimates of direct expenses related to these losses 
in addition  associated with the hurricane losses  we anticipate approximately million of business interruption proceeds to be collected and recorded to income in during  we incurred expenses of million related to the early retirement of debt compared to million in the early extinguishment of debt charges in related principally to secured debt that was retired on hotels that we have designated as non strategic 
the early retirement related principally to the early retirement of senior notes paying interest 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in included in was an million gain related to the sale of a residential condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
net income from unconsolidated ventures owning hotels increased in principally related to improvements in revpar 
minority interest increased by million in compared to  principally resulting from felcor lp s minority interest in the impairment loss in discontinued operations provided net income of million in compared to a loss of million in included in the loss in discontinued operations is a million impairment loss 
included in discontinued operations are the results of operations of the hotels disposed in preferred dividends increased by million in compared to the principal reasons for this increase are attributed to the issuance of million of series a preferred stock in and the first full year of dividends in in accordance with the emerging issues task force topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  we have subtracted million of the issuance costs of our redeemed series b preferred stock from net income to determine net loss applicable to common stockholders for the calculation of net loss per share 
comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to a loss in of million 
during  our hotel operating revenue from continuing operations increased by million  reflecting the increase in revpar for the year 
this revpar improvement came on the heels of an unprecedented three year decline in our revpar  which has resulted in hotel revenues remaining well below historical levels 
also contributing to the current year loss were million of net costs associated with the early retirement of million in senior notes  million of impairment charges on our hotels  a million charge associated with the early termination of a hotel lease  million of hurricane losses sustained in the third quarter at of our hotels  and a gain of million from the development and sale of the unit margate condominium tower at the kingston plantation in myrtle beach  south carolina 

table of contents our revenues from continuing operations for were billion  which reflected a increase  over the increase in revenues principally resulted from the increase in hotel revpar 
our hotel portfolio occupancy increased by over the prior year and its adr increased by 
we attribute the increase in revpar to the general firming of the us economy resulting in increased business travel  from which we derive a significant portion of out hotel business 
business travelers generally pay a higher room rate than other types of hotel guests and  as business travel increases  we are able to accept smaller amounts of lower room rate business 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for was the acquisition in march of the holiday inn in santa monica  california  which contributed million of our consolidated revenues in the hotel ebitda margin of our hotels included in continuing operations at december   was compared to in the slight increase in hotel ebitda margin is attributed primarily to decreases in property tax and insurance expenses  which were largely offset by increased labor related costs 
property tax expense decreased in  compared to  largely from reductions in assessed values and resolution of prior years property tax appeals 
the reduction in insurance expense  compared to the prior year  reflects the softening in the property insurance markets and reductions in general liability losses 
our interest expense included in continuing operations decreased by  to million  as compared to the reduction in interest expense is related to a million reduction in outstanding debt and a reduction in our weighted average interest rate by basis points  compared to the change in debt outstanding and the reduction in average interest rate resulted principally from the following capital transactions we completed the early retirement of million in senior notes o million of senior notes maturing in that bore interest at  and o million of senior notes maturing in october  we issued million of floating rate senior notes  we issued million in mortgage debt  and we issued million of convertible preferred stock 
in  we recorded impairment charges  under the provisions of sfas  of million  million of which is included in continuing operations and the remainder is included in discontinued operations 
the charges related to hotels 
with respect to one hotel  we entered into an option in the third quarter that would permit the option holder to purchase the hotel for substantially less than its carrying value 
the remaining hotels either had revised estimates of fair value or reduced estimated holding periods 
during  we completed the early retirement of million of senior notes 
associated with this early retirement  we recorded a charge off of deferred financing costs of million  a loss on early retirement of debt representing the premium paid at retirement of million  and we had a gain of million related to the termination of an interest rate swap on a portion of these notes 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities increased million compared to the principal component of this increase was our portion of the gain on the development and sale of the margate condominium tower at the kingston plantation in myrtle beach  south carolina  by an unconsolidated entity in which we owned a interest

the following tables reconcile each of these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures  including ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and operating managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin is useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating corporate level expenses  depreciation and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our 
table of contents assets 
to enhance the comparability of our hotel level operating results with other hotel reits and hotel owners  we are now disclosing hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin rather than the hotel operating profit and hotel operating margin previously disclosed 
the purpose of the change is to remove any distortion created by unconsolidated entities and to reflect hotel level operations as if they were fully consolidated 
to reflect this  we eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by minority interest expense and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our hotels 
use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  as presented by us  may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither should ffo  ffo per share or ebitda be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions or service our debt 
ffo per share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  is from the results of operations of our hotels 
for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of hotel operations  was million 
at december   we had cash on hand of million 
included in cash on hand was million held under our hotel management agreements to meet our hotel minimum working capital requirements 
we currently expect that our cash flow provided by operating activities for will be approximately million to million 
these cash flow forecasts assume a revpar increase of to  and hotel ebitda margin increases of at least basis points 
our current operating plan contemplates that we will make preferred dividend payments of million  capital expenditures of approximately to million  million in normal recurring principal payments  and that we will defer a debt maturity of million which we currently anticipate extending in accordance with its terms  leaving a cash flow shortfall of approximately million to million 
we expect the cash necessary to fund this cash flow shortfall and distributions  if any  on our common stock  will come from our cash balances or the proceeds from the sale of hotels 
we anticipate that our board of directors will determine the amount of preferred and common dividends  if any  for each quarterly period  based upon the actual operating results of that quarter  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as the minimum reit distribution requirements 

table of contents during  our hotels in new orleans and surrounding markets  such as atlanta  georgia  baton rouge  louisiana  houston  san antonio  and dallas  texas  benefited from the increase in demand for hotel rooms  resulting from the displacement of new orleans residents  and from the influx of relief and construction workers 
we believe that the increased demand in most of these markets will continue into  but we are unable to predict how long 
we expect cash flow from operations to be sufficient to cover the payment of a dividend on our common stock  our full preferred stock dividends as well as the funding of maintenance capital expenditures of five percent of annual hotel revenues for the foreseeable future 
events  including the threat of additional terrorist attacks  us military involvement in the middle east and the bankruptcy of several major corporations  had an adverse impact on the capital markets in prior years 
similar events  such as new terrorist attacks or additional bankruptcies  could further adversely affect the availability and cost of capital for our business 
in addition  any slowdown of the overall economy and of the lodging industry could adversely affect our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business 
as a consequence of the recent economic recovery  its impact on the travel and lodging industries  and our lower secured debt levels  standard poor s raised their ratings on our senior unsecured debt in  from b to b 
should standard poor s or moody s increase their ratings on our senior unsecured debt to bb or ba  respectively  our interest rates on million of our senior unsecured debt will drop by basis points  reducing our interest expense by million annually 
we are subject to the risks of fluctuating hotel operating margins at our hotels  including but not limited to increases in wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities  insurance  and other operating expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  resulting in an increased risk of volatility in our results of operations 
the recent economic slowdown that began in  led to a sharp drop in occupancy and adr resulting in declines in revpar and in the erosion in our hotel ebitda margins through our hotel ebitda margins from continuing operations increased to in however  if our hotel revpar and or operating margins worsen  they could have a material adverse effect on our operations  earnings and cash flow 
in the fourth quarter of  we retired million of secured debt related to hotels and entered into a million unsecured term loan 
in connection with the early retirement of million of secured debt  we recorded million expense in the fourth quarter of the million term loan was subsequently retired in january with proceeds from hotel sales  cash on hand and million drawn on our million line of credit established in january associated with the early retirement of the million term loan in january  we will record million write off of loan costs in the first quarter of our line of credit established in january  has certain restrictive covenants  including a leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  unencumbered leverage ratio and a maximum payout ratio 
in addition to financial covenants  our line of credit includes certain other affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to create or acquire wholly owned subsidiaries  restrictions on the operation ownership of our hotels  limitations on our ability to lease property or guarantee leases of other persons  limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as distributions on common and preferred stock  share repurchases and certain investments  limitations on our ability to merge or consolidate with other persons  to issue stock of our subsidiaries and to sell all or substantially all of our assets  restrictions on our ability to make investments in condominium developments  limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business and limitations on our ability to modify certain instruments  to create liens  to enter into transactions with affiliates and limitations on our ability to enter into joint ventures 
at the date of this filing  we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
if operating results fall significantly below our current expectations  as outlined in our current guidance  we may not be able to satisfy the financial covenant requirements in our current line of credit and we may be unable to borrow under it 

table of contents during  we issued million depositary shares representing our series c preferred stock  with gross proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to redeem all of the shares outstanding of our series b preferred stock 
as a result of this redemption  we recorded a reduction in net income applicable to common stockholders of million for the original issuance cost of the series b preferred stock which was redeemed 
in  eight limited service hotels owned by a consolidated joint venture were surrendered to their non recourse mortgage holders in exchange for extinguishment of approximately million of debt 
in  we started construction on the unit royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
this project is more than pre sold and is expected to be completed in the summer of in conjunction with this development  we entered into a million recourse construction loan facility 
at december   we had spent million on this project and had drawn million on the construction loan 
the interest on this construction facility is currently based on libor plus basis points and may be reduced to libor plus basis points when the project is complete upon satisfaction of certain other requirements 
at december   we had aggregate mortgage indebtedness of million that was secured by of our consolidated hotels with an aggregate book value of billion and our royale palms condominium development 
substantially all of this debt is recourse solely to the specific assets securing the debt  except in the case of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
loans secured by hotels provide for lock box arrangements 
with respect to loans secured by hotels  the owner is permitted to retain of budgeted hotel operating expenses before the remaining revenues would become subject to a similar lock box arrangement if a specified debt service coverage ratio was not met 
the mortgage loans secured by eight of these hotels also provide that  so long as the debt service coverage ratios remain below a second  even lower minimum level  the lender may retain any excess cash after deduction for the of budgeted operating expenses  debt service  tax  insurance and other reserve requirements and  if the debt service coverage ratio remains below this lower minimum level for consecutive months  apply any accumulated excess cash to the prepayment of the principal amount of the debt 
if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the lower minimum level for three consecutive months  any then accumulated excess cash will be returned to the owner 
eight of these hotels  which accounted for of our total revenues in  are currently below the applicable debt service coverage ratio and are subject to the lock box provisions 
none of the hotels are currently below the second  even lower minimum debt service coverage ratio that would permit the lender to retain excess cash after deduction for the of budgeted operating expenses  debt service  tax  insurance and other reserve requirements 
most of our mortgage debt is non recourse to us and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment penalties  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
the breach of any of the covenants and limitations under our line of credit could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding 
our failure to satisfy any accelerated indebtedness  if in the amount of million or more  could result in the acceleration of most of our other unsecured recourse indebtedness 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances our other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than our line of credit 
our publicly traded senior unsecured notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  pay dividends in excess of the minimum dividend required to meet the reit qualification test  repurchase capital stock  or merge 
as of the date of this filing  we have satisfied all such tests 
under the terms of certain of our indentures  we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our capital stock  whether common or preferred  subject to certain exceptions  so long as our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the indentures  exceeds to debt  as defined in the indentures  approximates our consolidated debt 
ebitda is defined in the indentures as consolidated gaap net income  adjusted for 
table of contents minority interest in felcor lp  actual cash distributions by unconsolidated entities  gains or losses from asset sales  dividends on preferred stock and extraordinary gains and losses as defined at the date of the indentures  plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense and other non cash items 
although our current debt to editda ratio is below to  a decline in our ebitda  as a result of asset sales or adverse economic developments  or an increase in our debt  could make us subject to this limitation 
if actual operating results fall significantly below our current expectations  as reflected in our current public guidance  or if interest rates increase substantially above expected levels  we may be unable to continue to satisfy the incurrence test under the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes 
in such an event  we may be prohibited from  among other things  incurring any additional indebtedness  except under certain specific exceptions  or paying dividends on our preferred or common stock  except to the extent necessary to satisfy the reit qualification requirement that we distribute currently at least of our taxable income 
we currently anticipate that we will meet our financial covenant and incurrence tests under the revpar guidance provided by us at our fourth quarter earnings conference call on february  for the first quarter of  we currently anticipate that our portfolio revpar will be to above the comparable period of the prior year 
the revpar increase in  compared to the same periods in  was approximately for january and for february we currently anticipate that full year hotel portfolio revpar will increase approximately to 
for  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately to million 
we estimate that our income for will be in the range of to million 
ffo for the year is anticipated to be within the range of to million  and ebitda is expected to be within the range of to million

we are to agree upon special capital plans to be completed by july with regard to four hotels and january with regard to two hotels 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures  and we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that operate four of those hotels referred to as operating joint ventures 
we own of the lessees operating two hotels owned by the hotel joint ventures  of the lessees operating hotels owned by the hotel joint ventures and one hotel joint venture is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to the hotels 
this debt is not reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liability with regard to non recourse debt and the liability of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to the guarantee of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities of million  million  including a gain of million related to the development and sale of condominiums  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations million of which million was provided by operations and million for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from the operating lessees 
we own of the operating lessees for of the hotel joint ventures and of the operating lessee for one of the hotel joint ventures 
the owned operating lessee incurred aggregate net losses  which were included in our consolidated statements of operations  of million during the past three years 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally paid from their capital reserve account  which is funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  any of our subsidiaries that serve as a general partner will be liable for all of the recourse obligations of the venture  to the extent that the venture does not have sufficient assets or insurance to satisfy the obligations 
in addition  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations or make distributions to our equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful 
table of contents life 
in we identified hotels  in we identified two hotels  in we identified hotels and in we identified hotels  that we expect to sell 
the shorter probable holding periods related to our decision to sell these hotels was the primary factor that led to impairment charges on these hotels 
as we sell these hotels  we may recognize additional losses or gains on sale 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotel assets  and in establishing the impairment charge  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following o annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  o holding periods  o expected remaining useful lives of assets  o estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and o future capital expenditures 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the hotels that may not be reflected in the hotel s current carrying value  thereby requiring additional impairment charges in the future 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for contingencies 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in  we initially became self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
at december   we had of our hotels participating in this program 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given accounting date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we had recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
in accordance with these pronouncements  all of our interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   were designated as cash flow hedges because they are hedging our exposure to the changes in interest payments on our floating rate debt 
these instruments are adjusted to our estimate of their fair market value through accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
we estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps and fixed rate debt through the use of a third party valuation 
we may use other methods and assumptions to validate the fair market value 
at december   our estimate of the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was approximately million and represents the amount that we estimate we would currently receive upon termination of these instruments  based on current market rates and reasonable assumptions about relevant future market conditions 
our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the net deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million 
table of contents deferred tax asset related to our trss  because of the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting announcements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no

generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective in the first annual reporting period beginning after june  we expect to adopt this standard under the modified prospective application 
we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on us 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and through the normal operation of the asset 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
