key business metrics for the year ended december   we generated total revenue of  and a net loss of during  we acquired approximately  new audiblelisteners  up from approximately  acquired in this increase in new audiblelisteners acquired resulted in total audiblelisteners of approximately  as of december   compared to approximately  as of december  churn  a measure of audiblelistener member cancellation  increased in over  due primarily to the increase in new audiblelisteners acquired through free trial programs  which subsequently paid for a membership after the free trial and then cancelled 
on a quarterly basis  we calculate monthly churn as the number of member cancellations in the period divided by the sum of audiblelistener members at the beginning of the period plus gross member additions  divided by three months 
as a result of experiencing higher churn on free trial programs  we have reduced our reliance on acquiring new audiblelisteners through trial programs 

table of contents the following table sets forth the average monthly churn in audiblelistener members in and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter during  we launched four important initiatives audible uk  audibleair  audibleeducation  and new audiblelistener membership plans 
in february  we established audible uk  a spoken audio web site service mirroring the us company service  but focused on the uk marketplace 
we purchased one share of audible uk stock on february   at which date it became a wholly owned subsidiary 
audible uk began commercial operations in june audibleair is an innovative new service that allows the automated wireless download of secure digital audio files to certain smart digital phones 
customers can now bypass connecting to the desktop and program their audible content to be delivered wirelessly anytime and anywhere 
customers can refresh their content automatically as audibleair recognizes how much of a downloaded audio program they have heard 
the application retains the portion they haven t listened to  while refreshing the device with new audio 
any content in the audible my library can be accessed by our customers and downloaded at any time 
audibleeducation is a section of our web site that provides a selection of education content designed for students of all ages 
we intend to capitalize on the significant demand for strategic partnerships with entities positioned within the numerous multi billion dollar markets in corporate learning  higher education  professional certification  test preparation  continuing education  and direct to consumer education 
our new audiblelistener membership plans  launched in december  provide an array of new member benefits  ranging from greater flexibility in using audiblelistener membership credits  to everyday discounts on a la carte purchases  and a daily new york times or wall street journal subscription included in the membership fee 
for  our major goals include increasing the number of new audiblelisteners we acquire  reducing our churn rate and increasing customer satisfaction 
subsequent to our earnings announcement on february   we revised our previously reported results of operations for the three months ended december  and for the revisions resulted from corrections discussed in item a  changes in estimates and reclassifications and audit adjustments that took place during the completion of our financial reporting process

we began to make these investments in november critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we have other significant accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we derive our revenue from four main categories content and services revenue  which includes consumer content and corporate services  hardware revenue  related party revenue  and other revenue 
content and services 
consumer content revenue consists primarily of content sales made from our web sites and content sold through our agreement with the apple itunes music store 
at our web site  customers purchase content either through an audiblelistener membership plan or on an a la carte basis 
when purchased on an a la carte basis  we recognize revenue from the sale of individual content titles in the period when the content is purchased and delivered 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of content subscriptions pro rata over the term of the subscription period  depending on the terms of the plan 
our legacy audiblelistener monthly membership plans generally provide customers two audio credits for a fixed monthly fee 
customers may use these audio credits to select content of their choice from our web site 
through november legacy audiblelistener audio credits provided under a monthly membership program had a life of days  after which they expired 
we recognize revenue from the sale of legacy audiblelistener memberships ratably over the audiblelistener s monthly membership period 
this results in approximately of the audiblelistener membership fees received during each calendar month being deferred at month end and recognized as content revenue in the following month 

table of contents in december  we introduced new audiblelistener membership plans  designed to provide our customers more flexibility in using their audio credits 
depending upon the audiblelistener membership plan  customers can receive and bank or delay using up to a maximum of six or twelve audio credits  depending on the membership plan 
the banking feature will result in audio credits being used delivered over different periods for different customers 
in addition  some of the new audiblelistener plans include new membership benefits  ranging from a complimentary daily newspaper to everyday discounts of on a la carte purchases 
the daily newspaper and discount benefits are serial elements that are delivered continuously over the membership period  whereas the content selections underlying the audio credits are discrete elements that are delivered at different times based on individual customer behavior 
as a result of the characteristics of the new audiblelistener memberships  they are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  however under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  because the deliverables are not eligible for separation  they are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
as a result  we recognize revenue for these new audiblelistener plans using the lesser of straight line or proportional performance based on content delivery over the maximum membership period 
this may result in a decrease in revenue or slower revenue growth than we experienced in prior periods because the customer has a longer period of time to use their audio credits 
for example  a customer may pre pay an annual membership for twelve audio credits and not use any credits for six months 
due to the revenue recognition model  this revenue will be deferred until the customer uses the audio credits 
upon launch of the new audiblelistener plans in december  the legacy audiblelistener programs were no longer available to new customers 
customers who have legacy memberships have the option of either converting to one of the new audiblelistener membership plans or continuing their legacy membership 
provision for refunds and chargebacks in the normal course of business  customers may contact us or contact their credit card company to request an adjustment for a purchase the customer paid us for in the past 
customers may contact us to request a refund for various reasons 
we record a provision for expected refunds and chargebacks relating to revenue that was recognized in a previous period 
the calculation of the provision for estimated refunds and chargebacks is based on historical refund rates and sales patterns 
the provision is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
a portion of the resulting reserve is classified as a reduction of accounts receivable based on an estimate of refunds and chargebacks that will be made related to sales that were collected by the credit card processor but not remitted to us at period end 
the remaining portion of the reserve is reflected as an accrued liability at period end 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
customer concessions in the normal course of business  customers may contact us to request a concession for a purchase the customer paid us for in the past  which they are unsatisfied with 
depending on the specific customer facts and circumstances  we will provide the customer a replacement or complimentary credit or a coupon 
with our legacy audiblelistener plans  customers on occasion request that we replace an audio credit that expired before the customer had an opportunity to use it 
other customers may request an audio credit or coupon because they have had a specific problem with content downloading or audio quality 
we defer revenue for expected replacement audio credits based on historical experience of the credits issued 
we defer revenue for other audio credits and coupons when they are delivered to the customers based on estimated values 
the concessions are recorded as a reduction of revenue and an increase to deferred revenue 
actual customer credit and coupon issuance and usage patterns could differ from our estimates 
royalty expense royalty expense is the largest component of cost of content and services revenue  and includes amortization of guaranteed royalty obligations to various content providers  royalties incurred on sales of content  and net realizable value adjustments to royalty advances 
many of our early content provider agreements contained a requirement to pay guaranteed amounts to the provider 
anticipating that sales from these agreements would not be sufficient to recoup the amount of the guarantees  we adopted a policy of amortizing royalty guarantees straight line over the term of the royalty agreement  or expensing the royalty guarantees as incurred  whichever was sooner 
in addition  each quarter we review and compare any remaining unamortized guarantee balance with current and projected sales by provider to determine if any additional net realizable value adjustments are required 
royalty expense for sales of content is incurred based upon either a percentage of revenue or a fixed price per title in accordance with the terms of the applicable royalty agreement 
the royalty cost per title may differ depending upon whether the title is sold as part of an audiblelistener membership or sold as an a la carte sale 
actual sales could differ from our estimates of projected sales 
internal use software in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  all costs incurred for the development of internal use software that relate to the planning and post implementation phases of the development are expensed 
direct costs incurred in the development phase are capitalized and recognized over the software s estimated useful life  generally two years  commencing at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred 
we review the capitalized software costs for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows  undiscounted and without interest  is less than the carrying amount of the related asset  an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
there has been no impairment loss recognized as of december  actual cash flows could differ from our expectations 
warrants issued to non employees in exchange for goods and services we occasionally issue warrants to purchase shares of common stock to non employees as part of their compensation for providing goods and services 
we account for these warrants in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf the exercise price of the warrants is determined by the closing price of our common stock on the day of the agreement 
the fair value of the warrant issued is estimated using the black scholes model 
application of management s judgment is required in determining the assumptions concerning risk free interest rate  expected term of the warrant  dividend yield and expected volatility to be used in the black scholes model 
the fair value of the warrant is expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement and is recorded within the operating expense line item that best represents the nature of the goods and services provided 
depending on the terms of the warrant  we apply variable plan or fixed plan accounting in accordance with eitf employee stock based compensation arrangements as of december   we account for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
for options granted at an exercise price lower than the fair market value of the stock on the grant date  the intrinsic value is recorded as deferred compensation with a credit to additional paid in capital and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting term 
we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standard  share based payment  sfas no

r  we must select an appropriate option valuation model to value future share based payments  determine the attribution method for compensation cost and select the transition method to be used at date of adoption

the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and other unvested employee share based awards starting on the date of adoption of sfas no 
r 
we expect to use the modified prospective transition method when adopting sfas no
