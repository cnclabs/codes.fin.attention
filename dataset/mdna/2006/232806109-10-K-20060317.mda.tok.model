table of contents executive summary general we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad range of silicon based products and solutions for various markets including consumer  computation  data communications  automotive  industrial and solar power 
leveraging a strong commitment to customer service and performance based process and manufacturing expertise  our product portfolio includes a selection of wired and wireless universal serial bus usb devices  complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos image sensors  timing solutions  network search engines  specialty memories  high bandwidth synchronous and micropower memory products  optical solutions  reconfigurable mixed signal arrays and  through our majority owned subsidiary sunpower corporation sunpower  solar power products 
during the first quarter of fiscal  in conjunction with our restructuring plan  we reorganized our internal organization into the following reportable business segments reportable segments description consumer and computation division ccd a product division focusing on the clock  usb and programmable system on chip psoc products data communications division dcd a product division focusing on the specialty memories  programmable logic devices and network search engine products memory and imaging division mid a product division focusing on the static random access memories sram  pseudo sram and image sensor products sunpower a majority owned subsidiary of cypress specializing in solar power products other includes silicon light machines slm  a majority owned subsidiary of cypress specializing in optical components  silicon valley technology center svtc  a division of cypress  and certain foundry related services performed by us on behalf of others sunpower initial public offering ipo during the fourth quarter of fiscal  sunpower successfully completed the ipo of million shares of its class a common stock 
as of january   we owned approximately of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock approximately of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis  and approximately of the total voting power of sunpower s outstanding shares of capital stock 
the principal purposes for the ipo were to provide funds for sunpower s capital expansion  increase its working capital  create a public market for its class a common stock  facilitate its future access to the public capital markets  and increase visibility in sunpower s markets 
acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of smal technologies  inc smal  a company specializing in digital imaging solutions for a variety of business and consumer applications  such as digital still cameras  automotive vision systems  and mobile phone cameras 

table of contents through this acquisition  our goals are to accelerate our entry into the high volume cmos image sensor business and smal s product line will complement new mobile phone products introduced by fillfactory  which we acquired in fiscal smal is a part of our mid segment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired the outstanding minority interest in our subsidiary cypress microsystems cms 
cms develops and markets psoc devices for consumer electronics  handsets  networking equipment  industrial and automotive systems 
cms is a part of our ccd segment 
highlights of results of operations our revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or approximately  compared with fiscal overall strength in sunpower  driven by increased demand and manufacturing capacity  and ccd  driven by the strong acceptance of our psoc family of mixed signal arrays in consumer applications  was offset by weaknesses in mid and dcd 
gross margin in fiscal decreased approximately compared with fiscal a decrease in sales volumes  changes in product mix  and manufacturing constraints experienced in the second half of fiscal were the primary causes for the decrease in gross margin 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million lower compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to cost savings from the restructuring measures implemented in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations revenues year ended january  january  december  in thousands ccd dcd mid sunpower other total revenues ccd revenues from the sales of ccd products increased approximately million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in sales of our psoc products  driven by strong demand in consumer applications  including mp players and set top boxes  and continued expansion in computation platforms with major personal computer original equipment manufacturers 
in addition  continued adoption of our family of usb products in personal computer applications and consumer devices contributed an increase of approximately million in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in our general purpose and personal computer clock businesses 
revenues from the sales of ccd products increased approximately million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our psoc and usb products driven by demand in consumer applications  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our clock business 

table of contents dcd revenues from the sales of dcd products decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the decline of approximately million in sales of our programmable logic devices as they are reaching an end of life cycle 
in addition  softness in customer buying patterns in specialty memories and network search engine products contributed a decline of approximately million in revenues 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of certain products in our network search engine product family to netlogic microsystems  inc revenues from the sales of dcd products increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our network search engine products  partially offset by a decrease in revenues for certain of our communications products 
mid revenues from the sales of mid products decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately million in sales of our memory products  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in sales of our image sensor products 
the decrease in the sales of our memory products was primarily attributable to the decrease of approximately million in sales of our micropower and pseudo sram revenues for the mobile phone market primarily as a result of a general market transition to other products which we do not manufacture 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in sales of synchronous sram products for the high performance networking applications 
the increase in the sales of our image sensor products was primarily attributable to a full year of revenue contributions from fillfactory  which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and ten months of revenue contributions from smal  which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal revenues from the sales of mid products increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our synchronous sram and micropower products 
in addition  the increase was attributable to the addition of revenues from fillfactory  which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal prior to this period  we did not sell image sensor products 
sunpower revenues increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional manufacturing capacity  coupled with higher demand for its solar cells and panels driven by a strong global solar market 
sunpower will begin production in its third megawatt manufacturing line in the first quarter of fiscal revenues increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the initial sales of solar cell products in the second half of fiscal other revenues decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues generated in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in revenues generated by slm 
the decrease in slm s revenues was primarily due to the decline in royalty revenues from sony as the use of certain of slm s technology by sony came to an end in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents revenues increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues generated in fiscal while revenues from slm remained relatively flat year over year  revenues generated from svtc and foundry services increased in fiscal compared to prior year 
cost of revenues gross margin year ended january  january  december  in thousands cost of revenues gross margin gross margin decreased by approximately in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes coupled with the decline in the overall average selling prices asps 
in addition  gross margin was also impacted by product mix  as sunpower with lower margins became a larger component of our business and volumes from the dcd segment with higher margins declined 
during the second half of fiscal  gross margin was also negatively impacted by certain manufacturing constraints  including losses from power outages in our manufacturing facilities and one time expedite charges associated with the ramp of our psoc products 
sunpower is currently facing an industry wide shortage of polysilicon  the essential raw material used in the production of solar cells 
the prices that sunpower pays for polysilicon have increased recently and sunpower expects these price increases to continue in fiscal the negative impact of higher costs of polysilicon on sunpower s gross margin is expected to be offset over time by an increase in capacity utilization and other operating efficiencies 
these improvement initiatives include migration to thinner silicon wafer technology  process refinements to improve yield losses and increased production throughput 
although our overall asps declined slightly during fiscal  we were generally able to offset this effect and increase our gross margin by compared with fiscal this increase in gross margin was attributable to the continued reduction of manufacturing cycle times  reduced die size  improved labor productivity  more efficient use of capital resources  improved defect densities  improved yields and ultimately lower manufacturing cost 
inventory reserves our gross margin has also been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business including our inventory profile 
during fiscal  and  net impact of the inventory adjustments was a charge benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
the inventory reserve balance was million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
we record inventory write downs as a result of our normal analysis of demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory 
we record charges to cost of revenues to write down the carrying values of our inventories when their estimated market values are less than their carrying values 
the inventory write downs reflect estimates of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory carrying values and projected timing of product sales 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and volatile 
in recent years  a combination of global economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in the demand for semiconductors  coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity  caused significant declines in demand and average selling prices for semiconductor components 
these trends could continue in the future and could cause us to re evaluate our inventory costs  which could result in additional inventory reserves 
in reviewing our inventory reserves  we follow methodologies that are consistent with those used by other companies within the semiconductor industry 
at the time of an inventory write down  we make a determination  
table of contents based on demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory  that there is a very high probability that the inventory that was reserved would not be sold 
once the inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established  however  for tracking purposes  the write down is recorded as a reserve on the balance sheets 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 the contra asset account is relieved at the time the inventory is either sold or scrapped 
at january   the remaining inventory reserve represented the value of excess and obsolete inventories that have not been scrapped or sold 
research and development year ended january  january  december  in thousands research and development as a percentage of revenues research and development r d expenditures decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in employee related compensation expenses and million in depreciation 
the decrease in employee related compensation expenses was primarily attributable to the termination of employees under the restructuring measures implemented in fiscal  coupled with a decrease in stock based compensation charges primarily as a result of the release of the unamortized deferred compensation balance associated with the terminated employees and a decrease in acquisition related contingent compensation charges 
the decrease in depreciation was primarily attributable to the removal of excess property and equipment under the restructuring measures  coupled with the savings resulted from the changes in the useful lives of certain equipment and production assets during fiscal in addition  r d expenditures decreased by million for sunpower primarily due to the completion of certain r d efforts related to sunpower s solar cell products and production line in the philippines in late fiscal r d expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and other compensation due to a moderate pay increase  and a million increase in expenses related to sunpower consisting primarily of process development spending associated with the commercialization of its solar cell products and the start up costs related to its production line 
selling  general and administrative year ended january  january  december  in thousands selling  general and administrative as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was partially attributable to a benefit of million recognized in fiscal associated with the reduction of the allowance for uncollectible loans under the employee stock purchase assistance plan spap as a result of a significant reduction in outstanding balances under the plan at that time 
in addition  the increase was attributable to an increase of approximately million in employee related compensation expenses 
the increase in employee related compensation expenses was primarily due to severance and benefits relating to the termination of certain employees not included in our restructuring plan and a stock based compensation charge resulted from our subsidiary cypress microsystems during fiscal  partially offset by savings generated from the restructuring measures implemented in fiscal the increase in sg a expense was also attributable to an increase of approximately million in advertising expenses 

table of contents sg a expenses increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in employee related compensation expenses due to a modest pay increase  a million increase in professional fees primarily associated with new requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  a million increase in sales commissions driven by increased revenues  a million increase in travel expenses and a million charge for a damage claim settlement 
the increase in sg a expenses was partially offset by the million benefit related to our spap as discussed above 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in amortization of certain purchased technology intangibles as they had been fully amortized as of the end of fiscal or during fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in process research and development charges in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded in process research and development charges of million related to smal in fiscal and million related to fillfactory in fiscal  as technological feasibility associated with these in process research and development projects have not been established and no alternative future use existed 
in process research and development projects related to smal included the development of first generation automotive cameras and mobile phone sensors 
in process research and development projects related to fillfactory included the development of new image sensors in fillfactory s custom and standard product applications 
specifically  the custom products include industrial  automotive  medical and high end photography  and the standard products include high end photography  digital still cameras and wireless terminal cameras 
in assessing the projects  we considered key characteristics of the technology as well as its future prospects  the rate technology changes in the industry  product life cycles  and various projects stage of development 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the income approach method  which calculated the sum of the discounted future cash flows attributable to the projects once commercially viable 
discount rates were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect the stage of completion of the projects and the level of risks associated with the projects 
discount rates ranging from to were used for smal s projects and to were used for fillfactory s projects 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined by identifying the research and development expenses invested in the project as a ratio of the total estimated development costs required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the following table summarizes certain information of each significant project as of the acquisition date smal projects estimated stage of completion total cost incurred as of acquisition date total estimated costs to complete estimated completion dates first generation automotive cameras million million march mobile phone sensors million million march 
table of contents fillfactory projects estimated stage of completion total cost incurred as of acquisition date total estimated costs to complete estimated completion dates industrial million million may digital still cameras and wireless terminal cameras million million june medical million million june automotive million million january high end photography million million april status of in process research and development projects the status of the in process research and development projects is as follows smal to date  there have been no significant differences between the actual and estimated results of the in process research and development projects 
as of january   we have incurred total post acquisition costs of approximately million related to the in process research and development projects and estimate that an additional investment of approximately million will be required to complete the projects 
we expect to complete the projects by june  which has been delayed by one quarter 
the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to factors including the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
fillfactory there have been no significant differences between the actual and estimated results of the in process research and development projects 
as of january   we have incurred total post acquisition costs of approximately million related to the in process research and development projects 
all projects have been completed within the original estimated costs and timeframe 
other credits during fiscal  in connection with the construction of a facility  we entered into a tax abatement agreement with a development agency  which called for job creation and capital investment by us in return for a reduction in certain local taxes payable 
we were not able to fulfill certain terms of the agreement 
accordingly  at the time it became probable that certain terms of the agreement would not be met  we recorded an accrual of million  representing amounts payable under the agreement 
we never received any claim for repayment from the development agency 
at the end of fiscal  we determined that given the passage of time  there was a remote likelihood that the development agency would seek reimbursement of the amounts payable 
as a result  we released the accrual of million in fiscal and recorded the amount as a credit in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal  we decided to halt the construction of a facility and recorded an accrual of million  representing primarily the cancellation penalties payable to suppliers 
subsequently  no claims were made against us by the suppliers 
during fiscal  we determined that given the passage of time  there was a remote likelihood that the suppliers would seek the penalty payments from us 
as a result  we released the accrual of million in fiscal and recorded the amount as a credit in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents restructuring the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in demand for  and supply of  semiconductors 
in some cases  industry downturns have lasted more than a year 
prior experience has shown that restructuring of operations  resulting in significant restructuring charges  may become necessary if an industry downturn persists 
in addition  events and circumstances specific to us may result in restructuring charges 
we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
in addition  we had one other restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
the fiscal restructuring plan has been substantially completed with reserves remaining for lease payments for restructured facilities 
during fiscal  we completed the obligations under the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in january  we announced a plan intended to reduce costs and losses by approximately million per quarter 
this plan included restructuring activities implemented under the fiscal restructuring plan  and various other initiatives to reduce discretionary spending and reduce our losses 
as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we had realized these savings as described below 
the initiatives implemented under our fiscal restructuring plan were intended to generate savings by reducing employee related costs  disposing of excess equipment thereby reducing depreciation costs  reducing certain facility costs by existing certain facilities and ceasing operations of our subsidiary silicon magnetic systems sms 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we had realized these savings as follows approximately million in employee related compensation expenses due to the termination of employees  approximately million in depreciation as a result of the removal of excess property and equipment from operations  approximately million in rent expense due to the closure of facilities  and approximately million as a result of discontinuing the operations of sms 
the initiatives to reduce the amount of discretionary spending and reduce our losses were intended to generate savings of approximately million 
we achieved these savings during the second quarter of fiscal interest income interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash 
in addition  interest income included interest income associated with the outstanding loans to our employees under the spap 
interest income increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily driven by an increase of approximately million in interest income due to higher interest rates  coupled with higher average cash balances as a result of the net proceeds received from the sunpower ipo 
interest income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in interest income related to the spap due to lower outstanding loan balances 
the decrease was offset by an increase of approximately million in interest income primarily due to an increase in average cash and investment balances 
interest expense interest expense was primarily associated with our convertible subordinated notes and collateralized debt instruments 

table of contents interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we redeemed all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes notes  resulting in a decrease of million in interest expense in fiscal in addition  the decrease in interest expense was partially attributable to a decrease of approximately million in interest expense associated with our collateralized debt instruments due to lower principal balances 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in interest expense associated with our notes and convertible subordinated notes notes 
we redeemed a portion of our notes and all of our notes in june and july  respectively  resulting in a decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in interest expense associated with our notes and notes in fiscal was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in interest expense associated with our convertible subordinated notes notes 
we issued our notes in june other income expense  net the following table summarizes the components of other income expenses  net year ended january  january  december  in thousands amortization of bond issuance costs equity in net income of partnership investment loss on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes gain on sale of investment in nve corporation investment impairment and other charges changes in fair value of warrants held foreign exchange gain loss  net changes in fair value of investments held in trust for deferred compensation plan other total other income expense  net deferred compensation plan in fiscal  we adopted a deferred compensation plan  which provides certain key employees with the option to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement 
as of january  and january   deferred compensation plan assets of million and million  respectively  were recorded in other assets  and liabilities of million and million  respectively  were recorded in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we account for the deferred compensation plan in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the liabilities are being marked to market with the offset being recorded as an operating expense or credit 
the assets excluding the amounts invested in our common stock are marked to market with the offset being recorded in other income expense  net 
no entries are recorded for the amounts invested in our common stock since this is accounted for in treasury stock 

table of contents all amounts recorded under the deferred compensation plan were included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations year ended january  january  december  in thousands changes in fair value of assets recorded in other income expense  net changes in fair value of liabilities recorded in cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total expense benefit from provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million in fiscal  compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal and tax expense of million in fiscal the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily attributable to amortization of purchased intangibles and a release of previously accrued taxes as discussed below  offset by non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that is not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries 
the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes as discussed below  offset by foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
the expense in fiscal was largely attributable to foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
no tax benefit was recognized in fiscal  and for the future tax benefit of operating losses  as management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit would not be realized 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
deferred tax assets of million at january  were fully reserved due to uncertainty of realization 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business 
we and our affiliates file tax returns in each jurisdiction in which we are registered to do business 
in the us and many of the state jurisdictions  and in many foreign countries in which we file tax returns  a statute of limitations period exists 
after a statute of limitations period expires  the respective tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period 
similarly  we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  the statute of limitations expired for several tax jurisdictions 
the expiration of the statute of limitations led to management s assessment that previously accrued income taxes were no longer necessary 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded benefits of million and million  respectively  for the release of previously accrued income taxes 
sunpower ipo during the fourth quarter of fiscal  sunpower  a majority owned subsidiary of cypress  completed the ipo of million shares of its class a common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we recorded a gain of approximately million from the net proceeds and included it in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets 
following the ipo  sunpower has two classes of authorized common stock class a and class b common stock 
only we  our successors in interest and our subsidiaries may hold shares of sunpower s class b common 
table of contents stock unless we distribute the shares to our stockholders in a tax free distribution 
we currently do not have a plan to make such a distribution 
as of january   we owned million shares of sunpower s class b common stock  or approximately of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock approximately of sunpower s total outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis  and approximately of the total voting power of sunpower s outstanding shares of capital stock 
separation agreements in connection with the ipo  we entered into a master separation agreement containing the framework with respect to sunpower s separation from us 
the master separation agreement provides for the execution of various ancillary agreements that further specify the terms of the separation 
both the master separation agreement and the various ancillary agreements became effective upon the completion of the ipo 
the various ancillary agreements primarily include a tax sharing agreement  a master transition services agreement  a lease agreement for sunpower s manufacturing facility in the philippines  a wafer manufacturing agreement  and an employee matters agreement

liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our consolidated cash and investments  working capital and long term debt as of january  january  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital long term debt excluding current portion the balance as of january  included the net proceeds of million from sunpower s ipo 
key components of cash flow year ended january  january  december  in thousands net cash flow generated from operating activities net cash flow used for investing activities net cash flow generated from used for financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  cash generated from operations decreased million compared with fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a net loss incurred in fiscal compared with net income generated in fiscal  adjusted for certain non cash items such as restructuring charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million in purchases of property and equipment which included million use of cash for sunpower s purchases and used an additional million  net of cash received  in our acquisitions of smal and the minority interest in cms 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of million  net of purchases 

table of contents during fiscal  cash generated from financing activities included approximately million of net proceeds from sunpower s ipo 
in addition  the issuance of common shares upon exercise of stock options by employees generated million in cash 
the increase was partially offset by repayment of debts of approximately million 
during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  compared with million in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to net income generated in fiscal compared with a net loss in fiscal  adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities  used cash of million  acquisition of property and equipment used an additional million in cash which included million use of cash for sunpower s purchases  and we spent a total of million in our acquisitions  net of cash received  of cascade and fillfactory 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the collection of loans from employees under the spap of million 
during fiscal  we used million to redeem the remaining notes 
this was partially offset by million from the issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options by employees 
during fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  which was primarily due to a smaller net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash generated from operations included an increase in working capital of million 
inventory reductions due to increased sales were more than offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable and a significant decrease in accounts payable 
purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities  used cash of million in fiscal  as we made additional investments due to our improved cash position 
acquisition of property and equipment used an additional million in cash which included million use of cash for sunpower s purchases 
these reductions in cash were partially offset by proceeds from the collection of loans from employees under the spap of million 
during fiscal  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our notes 
of the proceeds received  we used million to retire all of our notes and a portion of our notes  million to repurchase million shares of our common stock  million for debt issuance costs and million to purchase a call spread option on our common stock to mitigate the potential dilution of the notes 
liquidity our board of directors has approved a program authorizing the repurchase of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the maximum amount that can be repurchased is limited to million 
we have million of aggregate principal amount in the notes that are due in june we have the ability to call for redemption all or a portion of the notes any time after june  the notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios 
as of january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
if we failed to be in compliance with these covenants beyond any applicable grace period  the trustee of the notes  or the holders of a specific percentage thereof  would have the ability to demand immediate payment of all amounts outstanding 
on june   we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for us manufacturing and office facilities 
the lease agreement requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration 
if we had exercised our right to purchase all the properties subject to this lease at 
table of contents january   we would have been required to make a payment and record assets totalling million 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for this lease 
as of january   the amount of restricted cash and accrued interest was million  which was classified as a non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
in september  we entered into a million  month revolving line of credit with a major financial institution 
in december  this line of credit was extended to december and the total amount was increased to million 
as of january   no amount was outstanding 
loans made under the line of credit bear interest based upon the wall street journal prime rate or libor plus a spread at our election 
the line of credit agreement includes a variety of covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness  incurrence of loans  the payment of dividends or distribution on our capital stock  and transfers of assets and financial covenants with respect to tangible net worth and a quick ratio 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants 
our obligations under the line of credit are guaranteed and collateralized by the common stock of certain of our business entities other than sunpower 
we intend to use the line of credit on an as needed basis to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we entered into certain long term loan agreements with two lenders with an original aggregate principal amount equal to million 
these agreements are collateralized by specific equipment located at our us manufacturing facilities 
principal amounts are to be repaid in monthly installments inclusive of accrued interest  over a three to four year period 
the applicable interest rates are variable based on changes to libor rates 
the loans are subject to financial and non financial covenants 
as of january   the outstanding principal balance was million and we were in compliance with the covenants 
we have subsequently paid the remaining principal amount of million relating to one of the loans in january in february  we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of smal 
we acquired smal for a total cash consideration of million  net of cash received 
in addition  in december  we completed the acquisition of the minority interest in cms for a total cash consideration of million 
several of our acquisitions obligate us to pay certain contingent compensation in cash based on continued employment and meeting certain milestones 
as of january   total outstanding contingent compensation that could be paid in cash under our agreements  assuming all contingencies are met  was million 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities 
accordingly  at the end of fiscal  in addition to million in cash and cash equivalents  we had million invested in short term investments that are available for current operating  financing and investing activities  for a total liquid cash and investment position of million 
we had an additional million of restricted cash related to our synthetic lease for a total cash  short term investments and restricted cash position of million 
as of january   we had outstanding million in principal amount of our notes 
our cash and investment balances included approximately million of sunpower s cash and cash equivalents  which were primarily generated from its ipo 
sunpower intends to use approximately million of the proceeds for the expansion of its manufacturing capacity  with the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
specifically  sunpower may exercise its option to purchase its philippines manufacturing facility from us under the lease agreement for that facility 
in addition  sunpower may also use a portion of the proceeds to acquire businesses  products and technologies that complement its business 
we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and our borrowing arrangements described above will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve 
table of contents months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we would be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations payments due by periods total year years years more than years in thousands debt notes principal notes interest other principal other interest customer advances principal interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations customer advances were primarily related to an agreement entered into between sunpower and one of its customers to supply solar cells 
as part of the agreement  this customer agreed to fund expansion of sunpower s manufacturing capacity to support the customer s solar cell product demand 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
purchase obligations represent principally our open purchase orders for services  software  manufacturing equipment and supplies 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
our purchase orders for raw materials and other similar goods and services are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other similar goods and services specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
blanket purchase orders are also excluded because they generally represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease on june   we entered into an operating lease agreement  commonly known as a synthetic lease  for manufacturing and office facilities located in minnesota and california 
a synthetic lease obligation of million with restricted cash collateral was established as of the second quarter of fiscal the synthetic lease requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration  which is june in addition  we may extend the lease if the lessor allows 
if we had exercised our 
table of contents right to purchase all the properties subject to the synthetic lease at january   we would have been required to make a payment totalling million the termination value 
if we exercised our option to sell the properties to a third party  the proceeds from such a sale could be less than the properties termination value  and we would be required to pay the difference up to the guaranteed residual value of million the guaranteed residual value 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we determined that the fair value associated with the guaranteed residual value embedded in the synthetic operating lease was million 
the amount was recorded in other assets and other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized over the term of the lease 
as of january   the unamortized balance was million 
we are required to evaluate periodically the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term 
in the event we determine that it is estimable and probable that the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term will be less than the termination value  we will ratably accrue the loss over the remaining lease term 
we have performed an analysis and determined a loss contingency accrual is required 
as of january   the accrued loss contingency totalled million  representing the amounts recognized in fiscal and the fair value analysis on the properties was performed by management with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for this lease 
as of january   the balance of restricted cash and accrued interest was million and was classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants associated with the synthetic lease 
as of january   we were in compliance with such financial covenants 
equity option contracts as of january   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million that were originally entered into in fiscal these options were included in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
we entered into the equity option contracts as part of our stock repurchase program 
the contracts require physical settlement and will expire in march upon expiration of the options  if our stock price is above the threshold price of per share  we will receive a settlement value totalling million in cash 
if our stock price is below the threshold price of per share  we will receive million shares of our common stock 
alternatively  the contracts may be renewed and extended 
during fiscal and  we received total premiums of approximately million and million  respectively  upon extensions of the contracts 
the amounts were recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets

fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the provision is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this provision in the first quarter of fiscal will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was zero for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets  goodwill impairments  investment impairments  restructuring charges  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when titles and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and customer acceptance and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we offer price protection and similar rights to certain us based distributors 
in addition  we provide limited stock rotation rights to these distributors 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other price protection credits to these distributors  revenues and costs relating to the distributor sales are deferred  on a gross basis  until such rights lapse  which is generally upon receiving notifications from the distributors that they have resold the products 
our method of deferral is based on certain assumptions 
reserves are provided for estimated returns relating to rights of return and other credits for price protection 
if actual results differ from our estimates  operating results could be adversely affected 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry no price adjustments or rights of return 
we have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of sale 
we make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
in that regard  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for these situations based on our experience with specific customers and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
our principal post shipment obligations to our customers are rights to limited stock rotation to our us based distributors as discussed above  and quality related issues for which a warranty reserve is provided by us 
in addition  we provide a volume pricing discount to certain contract manufacturers  which is recorded as a reduction in revenue 
such volume discounts have not been significant historically 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents as of january   we had outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved spap 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible loans 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible loans  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and a fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
the allowance was determined by management with the assistance of an analysis performed by an independent appraisal firm 
if the underlying assumptions supporting our reserve requirements  including the value of our stock price  change  future operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds nine months of demand for that device and or when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than six months 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
we recorded no impairment charges for fiscal  and however  if there is a significant decrease in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and  did not result in an impairment charge 
however  changes in these estimates could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in a future impairment of our remaining goodwill 

table of contents valuation of investments we hold equity interests in both publicly traded and privately held companies 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on a publicly traded investment  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are ultimately accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we review our non marketable investments periodically for impairment and the assessment requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  for example  when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have declined significantly over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve and companies in our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations 
our investments may become impaired in the future 
restructuring expenses we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the first quarter of fiscal and one initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal these plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return to profitability 
in connection with these plans  we have recorded  and will record  estimated expenses for severance and related costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continue to evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs 

table of contents accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profit from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature 
the fair market value of the notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair market value of the notes will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations 
as of january   the estimated fair value of the notes was approximately million based on quoted market prices 
a increase in quoted market prices would increase the estimated fair value of the notes to approximately million  and a decrease in the quoted market prices would decrease the estimated fair value of the notes to million 
the majority of our revenues  expenses and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established cash flow  fair value and balance sheet hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we have entered into a series of euro forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign denominated revenues at one of our subsidiaries 
the total notional amount of these contracts was million as of january  if the forecasted cash flow fails to materialize  we will have to close out the contracts at the then prevailing market rates  resulting in gains or losses 
a unfavorable currency movement would result in a loss of approximately million on these contracts 
investments in publicly traded and privately held companies other than sunpower  we have an investment in the common stock of a publicly traded company 
the equity investment is classified as available for sale and is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair 
table of contents value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  we hold warrants to purchase shares of the publicly traded company s common stock 
the warrants are being marked to market at the end of each reporting period with the resulting gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the values of the equity investment and the warrants are subject to market price volatility 
as of january   the balance of our equity investment was million 
a increase in the stock price would increase the fair value of our investment by approximately million  and a decrease in the stock price would decrease the fair value of our investment by approximately million 
as of january   the value of our warrants was million 
a increase in the stock price would increase the value of our warrants by approximately million  and a decrease in the stock price would decrease the value of our warrants by approximately million 
we have invested in several privately held companies  many of which can be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control over the companies in which we are investing  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
as of january   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million 
stock purchase assistance plan spap at the end of fiscal  we had million of principal and cumulative accrued interest relating to loans made to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved spap 
we made the loans to employees for the purpose of purchasing our common stock 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
in accordance with the plan  the chief executive officer and the board of directors do not participate in this program 
to date  write offs have been negligible 
as of january   we had an allowance for uncollectible loans against these loans of million 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible loans  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and an independent fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
as of january   the carrying value of the loans exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million 
the carrying value of the loans would exceed the underlying common stock collateral by million if our stock price increased  and by million if our stock price decreased 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we instituted a program directed at minimizing losses as a result of our common stock price fluctuations 
under this program  either a limit sale order or a stop loss order is placed on the common stock purchased by each employee with the loan proceeds once the common stock price exceeds that employee s break even point 
if the common stock price reaches the sale limit order or declines to the stop loss price  the common stock purchased by the employee under the plan will be automatically sold and the proceeds will be used to repay the employee s outstanding loan to us 
equity option contracts at january   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million which is classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contracts require physical settlement and will expire in march upon expiration of the options  if our stock price is above the threshold price of per share  we will receive a settlement value totalling million 
if our stock price is below the threshold price of per share  we will receive million shares of our common stock 
alternatively  the contracts may be renewed and extended
