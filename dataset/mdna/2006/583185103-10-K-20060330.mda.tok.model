item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
executive overview our results showed significant improvement over and reflects what we had anticipated would result from our past decisions to focus on our historically most profitable markets as well as the expansion of our higher margin construction materials segment 
our construction services segment was favorably influenced by having completed the gooseberry project with no additional losses 
we believe our mediocre performance in and was directly attributable to losses totaling approximately million on this now completed project 
besides avoiding any additional losses on the gooseberry project  we also had a number of projects that performed much better than their original estimates  thus contributing to the improved gross profit from construction services 
these project gross margin improvements primarily resulted from our project management s ability to implement cost saving planning and scheduling ideas  recommend and implement value engineering alternatives  increasing crew productivity and avoiding mistakes 
the construction materials segment had a record year in terms of both revenue and profit 
even though the total units sold decreased slightly  the ability to pass through rising raw materials costs helped account for increased revenue 
product pricing  logistical and equipment adjustments to minimize the impact of raw material shortages provided by third parties and other cost savings also contributed to improved gross profit for the construction materials segment 
in addition  minimizing worker downtime and lost 
table of contents time due to injuries will invariably result in improved profitability 
the completion of marked our eighth consecutive year of working over  man hours 
we continue to safely perform our work significantly better than industry averages 
for example  our lost time frequency rate which approximates the number of injuries requiring days away from work for every  man hours was compared to an industry average of this is approximately better than the industry average 
another frequently quoted safety statistic is a company s experience modification rating  or mod rate 
a mod rate less than one indicates that a company s loss history  based on past injuries  is better than the average company 
our mod rate is currently or better than the industry average 
another notable accomplishment during was the initial public offering of our ready mix  inc subsidiary 
the sale of approximately of our previously wholly owned subsidiary netted approximately million in proceeds  a portion of which was used to repay us for taxes and intercompany payables  and the balance will provide capital for further expansion of the cms as disclosed in rmi s public filings 
because we continue to own more than of the outstanding capital stock of rmi we will continue to consolidate all of rmi s revenue  gross profit  general and administrative expenses  and other income expenses into our results and only deduct  as a minority interest  the approximately of rmi s net income from our net income 
because rmi s initial public offering did not close until august   only approximately four months of minority interest deductions occurred in our current year income tax liability for was also favorably impacted by our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating losses 
the use of these nols resulted in a significantly reduced income tax liability for if we continue to be profitable  we expect year to year income tax liabilities to approximate of income before tax expense in future periods  which will increase or decrease depending upon the yearly net impact of permanent taxable and nontaxable differences between pretax financial income and expenses and taxable income and deductions 
we continue to work on the prosecution of outstanding construction project claims 
we are vigorously preparing for court dates scheduled in the fall of and we hope that the nevada supreme court will hear our appeal on the clark county claim during as well 
we cannot assure that these dates will not be delayed again 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicate dollars in thousands for the years ended december  as restated as restated revenue construction services construction materials total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income income tax expense minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net income depreciation and amortization 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
consolidated revenue improved to million for the year ended december   as further referred to as  from million for the year ended december   as further referred to as the improved revenue resulted from an million increase  net of inter company sales  from the cms  and an increase in revenue from the css of million 
the cms revenue increase was due primarily to an approximate increase in the average unit sales price in from  which was partially offset by a decrease in sales of cubic yards of concrete which we refer to as units in from backlog in the css decreased to million compared to million a year ago 
the beginning backlog in the css contributed to the increased revenue in  based on the progress schedules and nature of the contracts contained in the backlog at the beginning of because so much of our business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that we bid on and win 
bid bonds provided by our surety company are required on most of the contracts that we bid  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid by our css 
surety credit limits and conditions may improve as our financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will be increased 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased to million for from million for and consolidated gross margin  as a percent of revenue  increased to in from in gross profit from css increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods 
in  no additional loss was required to be recognized on the gooseberry project 
the total anticipated loss on the project is approximately million 
in august  we received a notice of substantial completion from the owner on the gooseberry project 
we are currently in the process of submitting to the owner the necessary documentation to support our potential claims of changed conditions  associated delays and renegotiable unit prices due to quantity changes and interference 
we believe  but can not assure  that there will not be any additional future losses 
gross profit margins are affected by a variety of factors including  the quality and accuracy of the initial estimate  construction delays and difficulties due to weather or other conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site 
gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin decreased to from in the respective periods 
the increase in gross profit and decrease in the gross profit margin during resulted primarily from our expansion of our operation and the under utilizing of new equipment 
we anticipate the under utilization of new equipment through our expansion efforts  but long term margins will benefit from the expansion efforts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million in the increase resulted from additional plant  equipment and vehicles we placed in service during and the th quarter of of the million for  million was from our construction materials segment  while million came from our construction services segment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in incentive compensation  a million increase in payroll and payroll related expenses and taxes  increases of million in insurance premiums  million in legal fees and increases in public company expenses of million  offset by million decrease in bad debt expense 
interest income  expense and other income 
interest income increased to 
million for compared to interest expense remained relatively flat at 
million for interest expense directly related to equipment is expensed as a cost of the equipment and is included in the cost of revenue 
other income for decreased to 
million compared to other income for consisted of gains on the disposal of property and equipment  which we did not have similar transactions in minority interest in consolidated subsidiary 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary represents the portion of income  net of tax  attributable to the shares of ready mix  inc not in our control 

table of contents income taxes 
the increase in the income tax provision for to million compared to an income tax provision of 
million for was due to an increase in the pre tax income during for  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes 
the difference between the amount of the tax provision and the actual cash outlay was due to the net operating loss carry forward and the tax treatment of disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options 
we restated our and financial statements due to our audit committee determining that previously recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were evaluated improperly
