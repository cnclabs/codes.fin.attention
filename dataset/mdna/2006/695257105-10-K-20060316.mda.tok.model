item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
basis of presentation financial statements for all periods presented in this report are prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied 
all per share information is presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior years financial information to conform to current year presentation 
on october   we completed the sale of most of our worldwide protective and flexible packaging businesses to pregis corporation 
we have reported the operating results of the affected businesses as income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for all periods presented 
in our consolidated statement of financial position  the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been classified as assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations  respectively 
these divested businesses historically were included in our protective and flexible packaging segment 
in conjunction with the sale of these entities  we reviewed our reporting segments in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
based on our review  we included the retained portions of the protective and flexible packaging businesses in our foodservice food packaging segment for all periods presented in this report 
the principal business retained produces egg packaging for food processors 
this operation was previously managed by the protective and flexible packaging business 
subsequent to the sale  this unit is managed as part of our foodservice food packaging business  along with our north american egg packaging product line 
following the divestiture  we have three reporting segments consumer products manufactures and sells disposable plastic  foam  molded fiber  pressed paperboard  and aluminum packaging products to consumer markets  such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  and discount chains 
products include waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
we sell many of our consumer products under well known trademarks  such as hefty r 
foodservice food packaging manufactures and sells foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging to customers in the food distribution channel who prepare and process food for consumption 
customers include restaurants and other institutional foodservice outlets  food processors  and grocery chains 
other relates to corporate and administrative service operations and retiree benefit income and expense 
the accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those for pactiv as a whole 
where discrete financial information is not available by segment  reasonable allocations of expenses and assets liabilities are used 
restructuring and other in the first quarter of  we announced a restructuring program to reduce manufacturing capacity and overhead costs and to reinvest a portion of the related savings in strategic growth initiatives 
implementation of the program resulted in the elimination of approximately salaried and hourly positions worldwide 
the total cost of the restructuring program was approximately million  million after tax  or per share  covering severance  asset write offs  and other  which consisted principally of asset removal costs 
the majority of the program was executed in the second quarter of after tax cash payments related to the restructuring and other actions totaled million in  and million in no further charges related to this program are anticipated 
the following summarizes impacts of the restructuring and related actions 
severance asset write offs other total in millions accrued restructuring balance at january  additions adjustments to the account consumer products foodservice food packaging other total additions adjustments cash payments charges against asset accounts accrued restructuring balance at december  additions adjustments to the account consumer products foodservice food packaging total additions adjustments cash payments charges against asset accounts accrued restructuring balance at december  cumulative restructuring costs at december  consumer products foodservice food packaging other total consists principally of asset removal costs  including asbestos insulation abatement and associated expenses at the company s closed molded fiber facility in the united kingdom 
executive overview business our primary business involves the manufacture and sale of consumer and specialty packaging products for the consumer and foodservice food packaging markets 
we operate manufacturing facilities in countries 
consumer products include plastic  aluminum  and paper based products  such as waste bags  food storage bags  and disposable tableware and cookware 
these products are sold under such well known brand names as hefty r  baggies r  hefty r onezip r  hefty r cinch sak r  hefty r the gripper r  hefty r zoo pals r  kordite r  ez foil tm  and hefty r serve n store r 
foodservice and food packaging products include foam  clear plastic  aluminum  pressed paperboard  and molded fiber packaging for customers in the food distribution channel 
customers include wholesalers  supermarkets  restaurants  and packer processors  who prepare and process food for consumption 
we sell our products to a wide array of customers worldwide 
customers include grocery stores  mass merchandisers  discount chains  restaurants  distributors  and fabricators 
costs incurred in connection with the manufacture and sale of these products are recorded in either cost of sales or selling  general  and administrative expenses 
greater than of our sales comes from products made from different types of plastic resins  principally polystyrene  polyethylene  polypropylene  and amorphous polyethylene terephthalate apet 
we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
in addition  in conjunction with our spin off from tenneco inc tenneco in  we became the sponsor of retirement plans covering participating employees of certain former subsidiaries and affiliates of tenneco 
we record net pension plan income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
however  when assessing our performance and returns  we typically exclude the effect of pension income and pension assets and liabilities 
several opportunities and challenges may influence our continued growth 
near term risks include the impact of energy cost volatility on resin costs the ability to increase selling prices the continued effectiveness of our productivity and procurement initiatives longer term risks include potential changes in consumer demand possible supplier and customer consolidations potential increases in foreign based competition possible growth in market share of unbranded products we expect to continue to be successful by adjusting selling prices to offset resin price movements implementing aggressive cost management and productivity programs leveraging our existing products into new distribution channels introducing innovative new products making strategic acquisitions significant trends and other matters the principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are plastic resins  principally polystyrene and polyethylene 
average industry prices for polystyrene were approximately higher in than in  driven principally by higher oil and benzene costs 
in  average industry prices for polyethylene rose approximately compared with  primarily fueled by higher natural gas prices 
in response to the significant escalation in resin costs  we raised selling prices in many areas of our business during  which was effective in offsetting resin cost increases 
resin costs will likely continue to be a source of uncertainty for us in the near term  as oil prices remain near their historic highs 
we are closely monitoring the resin marketplace in order to respond quickly to any raw material cost increases 
our business is sensitive to other energy related cost movements  particularly with respect to transportation  logistics  and utility costs 
historically  we have been able to mitigate higher energy related costs with productivity improvements and other cost reductions 
future significant energy related cost increases may not be fully offset by our productivity initiatives 
new consumer product lines launched in included hefty r serve n store r tableware  hefty r easy grip tm cups  and hefty r ez ovenware tm casserole pans 
our launch costs were on plan and reduced operating income by approximately million in we will continue to support these new items in  however  related spending is expected to have about one half the impact on operating income in as it did in on november   our board of directors decided to replace stock options as a part of our long term compensation program with performance shares 
there are two primary reasons for this change 
the first is to more closely align long term incentive compensation with pactiv s actual performance as measured by performance drivers under our performance share program 
the second is to more accurately reflect the true cost of such compensation in our income statement 
as part of this change  the board accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options  representing  shares  to november   in order not to distort the true expense of our long term incentive compensation program going forward 
because the exercise prices of these options were above the market value of pactiv stock on november   we did not record expense from this action 
in  approximately  performance shares were granted compared with approximately  shares in as a result  we recorded approximately million of additional compensation expense  net of tax  in compared with we expect to grant a similar number of performance shares in and we anticipate that this change in our long term compensation program will result in related costs  net of tax  being approximately million and million higher in and than in  respectively 
however  it is important to note that the projected increase in long term compensation costs is less than would have been the case if we had continued with stock options and began to expense them in  as required by sfas no 
r  share based payments 
year compared with results of continuing operations sales increase decrease amount percent in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging   total   total sales increased in on flat volume 
excluding the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates million and acquisitions million  sales grew  driven mainly by the impact of pricing actions to offset increased resin costs 
sales for the consumer products business increased in primarily as a result of price increases 
sales growth was driven by an increase in tableware  with the introduction of hefty r serve n store r plates and bowls and hefty r easy grip tm cups  along with the broad based impact of pricing actions to offset increased resin costs 
foodservice food packaging segment sales growth in was primarily a result of price increases implemented to offset the impact of higher polystyrene costs 
volume gains from acquisitions offset volume declines in the base business 
operating income increase decrease amount percent in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging other total total operating income increased in as a result of lower restructuring costs and positive spread the difference between selling prices and raw material costs  offset partially by higher new product launch costs  and higher manufacturing and logistics costs 
the following tables summarize the impact of restructuring and other charges on and operating income by segment 
operating income twelve months ended december  gaap restructuring and excluding restructuring basis other charges and other charges in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging other total operating income twelve months ended december  gaap restructuring and excluding restructuring basis other charges and other charges in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging other total we believe focusing on operating income excluding the effect of restructuring and other charges is a meaningful alternative way of evaluating our operating results 
the restructuring and other charges relate to actions that will have an ongoing effect on our company 
considering such charges as being applicable to only and could make our operating performance in those periods more difficult to evaluate when compared with other periods in which there were no such charges 
we use operating income excluding restructuring and other charges to evaluate operating performance and  along with other factors  to determine management compensation 
the following table summarizes operating income excluding restructuring and other charges for and increase decrease amount percent in millions consumer products foodservice food packaging other total total operating income excluding restructuring and other charges was down versus the decline primarily reflected higher new product launch  raw material  energy related  and logistics costs  which were partially offset by the effect of price increases 
operating income excluding restructuring and other charges for the consumer products business was down compared with the decline primarily was due to increased new product launch expenses  higher plastic resin and other energy related costs  and increased logistics costs  which were partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity gains 
operating income excluding restructuring and other charges for the foodservice food packaging business increased from the increase primarily reflected favorable spread  the benefit of the newspring acquisition  and productivity gains  offset  in part  by higher energy related and logistics costs 
operating income excluding restructuring and other charges for the other segment decreased from  principally due to higher compensation related expenses and a decrease in noncash pension income 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was  compared with for income from continuing operations we recorded income from continuing operations of million  or per share  in  compared with million  or per share  in current period results included restructuring and other charges of million after tax  or per share  and noncash pension income of million after tax  or per share

amounts allocated were million for and million for the buyer of the businesses did not assume the debt of the discontinued operations 
in addition  we do not have any debt repayment requirements as a result of the sale 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act provided for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that we repatriate 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of the accumulated foreign earnings of our discontinued foreign operations  and recorded a related tax expense of million

these included income taxes through october   certain royalty payments  and the costs of closing a facility in europe 
these costs were included in the calculation of the loss on the sale of the businesses

capital commitments commitments for authorized capital expenditures totaled approximately million at december  it is anticipated that the majority of these expenditures will be funded over the next months from existing cash and short term investments and internally generated cash 
contractual obligations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under long term contracts 
our long term contractual obligations at december   are summarized below 
due in more than total less than year years years years in millions long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total   includes fixed rate debentures  plus related interest payment obligations based on rates in effect at december  includes open capital commitments  amounts related to the purchase of minimum quantities of raw materials at current market prices under supply agreements and other long term vendor agreements with specific payment provisions and early termination penalties 
includes undiscounted workers compensation obligations  and undiscounted and unfunded post retirement medical and supplemental pension funding requirements 
liquidity and off balance sheet financing we use various sources of funding to manage liquidity 
sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and a year  million revolving credit facility  none of which was outstanding at december  we were in full compliance with financial and other covenants of our revolving credit agreement at year end we also use an asset securitization program as off balance sheet financing 
no amount was securitized under this program as of december   while million was securitized at december  termination of the asset securitization program would require us to increase our debt or decrease our cash balance by an amount corresponding to the level of sold receivables at such time 
as a result of the gulf coast hurricanes  an industry wide supply disruption of resin materials occurred 
we successfully managed our business through this disruption  minimizing the impact on our customers 
however  our inventory levels were lower than normal at year end in the first half of  we will be rebuilding our inventories  which may require additional cash usage 
we have pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
funding of the qualified us plan is determined by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
based on long term projections and regulations in existence at december   we do not expect to be required to contribute cash to this plan through at least we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash reserves  and the ability to obtain cash under our credit facilities and asset securitization program will be sufficient to meet current and future liquidity and capital requirements 
we do not expect the sale of substantially all of our protective and flexible packaging businesses to have a significant impact on future liquidity

changes in accounting principles in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 which addresses accounting for vies 
vies are defined as separate legal structures that either do not have equity investors with voting rights or have equity investors with voting rights that do not provide sufficient financial resources for entities to support their activities 
fin no 
requires that companies consolidate vies if they are required to recognize the majority of such entities gains and losses and disclosures be made regarding vies that companies are not required to consolidate but in which they have a significant variable interest 
we adopted fin no 
on december  see cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for further information 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
sfas no 
r superceded accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb no 
required that the intrinsic value method be used in determining compensation expense for share based payments to employees 
under sfas no 
r  employee compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value of awards 
expense is recognized in the statement of income over the period during which recipients of awards are required to provide service normally the vesting period 
sfas no 
r will be adopted using the modified prospective method as of january  the impact if sfas no 
r had been adopted in prior periods is similar to amounts shown under the stock based compensation section of note sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs be reported as cash flow from financing activities  rather than as cash flow from operating activities 
it is not possible to predict these amounts  since they depend on the timing of employee stock option exercises 
amounts recognized for such excess tax deduction benefits were million in  million in  and million in critical accounting policies following are our accounting policies that involve the exercise of considerable judgment and the use of estimates 
these have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally considered to have occurred as products are shipped 
in arriving at net sales  we estimate the amount of deductions from sales that are likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs 
these include volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   are reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales may increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories and at december   and  respectively is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
given the volatility of our costs of raw materials primarily plastic resins  we prefer the lifo method because it reflects the current cost of inventories in cost of sales 
if we had valued inventories using the first in  first out fifo accounting method as of january   net income would have been million  or per share  higher in  million  or per share  higher in  and million  or per share  higher in we periodically review inventory balances to identify slow moving and or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans we account for pension plans in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
pretax pension plan income was million in  million in  and million in pension income is included in the statement of income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
we estimate that our noncash pretax pension income will decline to million in projections of pension income are based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  assumptions pertaining to the amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions related to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing our assumption regarding the rate of return on pension plan assets  we estimate future returns on various classes of assets  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since inception in  our us qualified pension plan s annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
historically  the plan has invested approximately of its assets in equity securities and in fixed income investments 
after considering all of these factors  we concluded that the use of a rate of return on assets assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return on assets assumption would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption for our us plan is based on the composite yield on a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds constructed with durations to match the plan s future benefit obligations 
in this connection  the discount rate assumption for our us plan at our september measurement date was for  and for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact our pretax pension income by approximately million 
we use a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over a year period 
resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach discussed in sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
to manage these risks we may enter into various hedging contracts in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use hedging instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any transactions involving leveraged derivatives 
foreign currency exchange we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates  primarily related to the british pound and the euro 
associated gains or losses offset gains or losses on underlying assets or liabilities 
in managing foreign currency risk  we aggregate existing positions and hedge residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes foreign currency forward contracts in effect at december   all of which will mature in notional amount notional amount of foreign currency exchange rate in us dollars in millions  except settlement rates british pounds purchase sell euros purchase sell interest rates at december   we had public debt securities of million outstanding  with fixed interest rates and maturity dates ranging from to years 
should we decide to redeem these securities prior to their stated maturity  we would incur costs based on the fair value of the securities at that time 
in addition  we had other floating rate debt of million outstanding at december  the following table provides information about pactiv s financial instruments that are sensitive to interest rate risks
