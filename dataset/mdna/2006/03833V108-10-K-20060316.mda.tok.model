item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we are a results based advertising network that distributes advertisements for direct marketing advertisers across a network of third party web sites 
for advertisers  the aptimus network offers an internet based distribution channel to present their advertisements to users on web sites 
advertisers pay us only for the results that we deliver 
we then share a portion of the amounts we bill our advertiser clients with the third party web site owners or publishers on whose web properties we distribute the advertisements 
at the core of the aptimus network is a database configuration and software platform and direct marketing approach for which we have filed a non provisional business method patent application called dynamic revenue optimization 
this system is designed to determine the advertisements in our system for promotion on each individual web site that the system estimates may generate the greatest user response and revenue potential for that specific web site 
this estimation is made using computer based logic on a real time basis incorporating response history and value of the advertisements in our system 
the purpose of the system is to enhance results for our advertiser clients by presenting the offers in our database that are more likely to be of interest to specific customers  which enhancing revenues for our publishers and us 
our primary offer presentation format includes cross marketing promotions at the point of registration or other transactional activity on web sites 
we believe that users are more inclined to respond to our clients advertisements in an environment where they are engaged in some form of transaction  the logic being a consumer is more likely to take the additional action of responding to an ad when he or she is in a transaction frame of mind 
we thus strive to have our offers displayed in environments on our publishers web sites where consumers are taking some form of action 
actions can include when a user registers to be included in a web site community or to receive a newsletter  when a user logs in to a site where he or she is already registered  when a user downloads a software program or other product  and when a user completes an online survey 
in identifying potential publisher sites to include in our network  a key consideration for us is the number of registrations  log ins  downloads or other form of user transactions taking place on the site 
the more user transactions  the more desirable that publisher is for inclusion in our network 
over the past three years  a key focus of ours has been expanding the number of publishers in our network 
to this end  we have added six employees to our business development team since early december  whose job is to focus exclusively on adding new publishers to our network and expanding our relationships with current publishers 
in  we hired two senior level employees to head the business development team and expect to continue hiring business development personnel in the future as necessary 
our lead volumes remain concentrated among a limited number of top performing publishers 
while our goal is to expand the number of publishers and reduce the concentration of revenue from any one publisher  we anticipate that a limited number of publishers collectively will continue to account for a significant portion of our lead volume for the foreseeable future 
in late  we indefinitely suspended our email operations  which had been in decline in recent years 
while this business was historically high margin and contributed nearly and of the company s revenues in and  respectively  increasing resistance from isps and resulting deliverability challenges made growth and stability in this area uncertain 
marketplace trends also indicated further challenges ahead for the email business as a whole 
we thus elected to suspend our email marketing activities indefinitely to focus on more stable and predictable network based offer distribution solutions that we believe best serve our clients needs 
our most effective placement on publishers websites is at the point of a transaction where we host an offer page that is included as an intermediate step in the user initiated transaction process 
we define a transaction as a registration  download or other active participation point on a publisher website 
we consider these transaction oriented web site placements our core placements  and they are thus the focus of our model and are referred to in this financial report as our core placements 
our offers also appear in other formats where we either do not host the offer page or the page that we do host is not included as an intermediate step in a transaction process 
these other formats  which are collectively referred to in this financial report as other placements  include pop ups and pop unders  log ins  thank you pages  and non hosted pages with unrelated editorial and advertising content 
they do not include banners  skyscrapers and other  similar ad units  which to date we have elected not to support with our dynamic revenue optimization system 
the overall performance of these other placements has been widely variable historically  yet the supply of impressions in these other formats on a publisher s site can be substantial 
our website publishers measure our performance by comparing the revenue per thousand impression results to other available revenue generating solutions 
an impression occurs each time an offer is displayed on a user s computer screen 
while we do not use average revenue per impression or per lead in evaluating the performance of our business  website publishers do use this metric in comparing various advertising options 
publishers can source advertisements directly from advertisers and agencies  they can contract with advertising networks like our network to satisfy their advertising requirements or they can do a combination of both 
almost exclusively publishers use revenue per impression when comparing the relative benefits of these various options 
in addition  because of its value as a marketing tool to the publisher base  industry analysts find revenue per impression data useful 
we thus have regularly provided data on average revenues per impression in our public filings  intend to do so in the future and discuss average revenues per impression in our results of operations below 
however  the most important  consistent and reliable business metrics management considers in determining the health of the business are revenues and net profit loss 
in  we initiated a focused drive to improve lead quality and customer conversion for our advertising clients 
to this end  we terminated relationships with publishers with lower quality traffic and added or enhanced a number of automated data validation processes that screen in real time the lead data a user submits before that lead is passed on to our advertisers 
we also directed considerable energy in the year toward building distribution relationships with name brand and high quality web sites 
going forward  to support enhanced lead quality and attract new and larger advertisers and budgets  aptimus will continue to expand our technology and validation capabilities  add innovative product solutions  as well as develop focused marketing strategies around specific targeted verticals such as our newly updated www 
euniversitydegree 
com education site 
we will also continue pursuing distribution relationships with name brand and high quality publishers 
finally  we plan to hire seasoned sales professionals and support staff to target the primary education  finance  technology and other industry verticals 
in march  the company completed a million private placement investment with seven accredited investors 
the company sold the accredited investors  shares of unregistered aptimus  inc common stock at a price of per share 
in connection with this sale warrants for an additional  shares of common stock at a strike price of were also issued to the investors and warrants for an additional  shares of common stock at a strike price of were also issued to an entity who acted as a financial advisor in the transactions 
on april  we filed a registration statement on form s to register these shares 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on may  in march  shares of our common stock were re listed on the nasdaq national market exchange under the symbol aptm 
on march   the company s board of directors repriced the strike price of certain option grants issued to certain employees and directors in  including rob wrubel  director and president  bob bejan  director  senior members of the company s sales and business development groups  and other employees 
the original strike price of the grants that were affected by the repricing ranged from to 
the new strike price is 
a total of individuals representing  option shares were affected by the repricing 
in addition  the board of directors authorized the grant of  option shares to mr 
wrubel  and the grant an additional  to certain other senior members of the company s sales and business development groups 
each of these grants has a strike price of and vest over a four year period from the date of grant 
we are still in the process of evaluating the impact of the repricing and option grants on the quarter ended march  and future periods 
however  the impact is expected to be material 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from response based advertising contracts 
leads are obtained through promoting our clients offers across our aptimus network of web site publishers and opt in email lists 
revenues generated through network publishers and opt in email list owners are recorded on a gross basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue number eitf 
fees paid to network publishers and  formerly  opt in email list owners related to these revenues are shown as cost of revenues on the statement of operations 
revenue in thousands  except percentages percentage increase year ended december  year ended december  revenue per thousand impression cpm in thousands  except percentages and cpm data percentage increase decrease core placement cpm core placement page impressions other placement cpm other placement page impressions the increase in revenue is primarily due to expansion of our aptimus network  including the addition of new web site distribution publishers thereby increasing our page impressions and corresponding user transactions  and the expansion of our advertiser client base 
a primary focus for the company in was to continue expanding the number of publishers in our network  thereby increasing the number of placements  both core and other  and corresponding page impressions 
offsetting the increase in website distribution publishers revenues was a reduction in the revenue derived from email activity for the year ended december  email revenues decreased to  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue  in this decrease both in total and as a percentage of overall revenue is primarily a result of growing resistance from isps and resulting deliverability challenges that made growth and stability in email uncertain 
as discussed in the overview section in december of we indefinitely suspended our email channel as a vehicle for generating leads so that we could focus all of our attention and efforts on expansion of our network of website publishers 
for the year ended december   our average revenue per thousand impressions cpm for our core placements decreased to per thousand impressions compared to for the comparable period in our average revenue per thousand impressions for our other placements for the year ended december  decreased to from for the comparable period of the decrease in cpm rates for both our core and other placements resulted from our significant efforts in the current year to increase the back end conversion  or quality from an advertiser perspective  of the leads being delivered to our clients 
a primary change we made to effect client back end conversion quality was that during the second half of we ended multiple existing publisher relationships 
we identified the sites in our network that had high impression volume yet had a user experience that involved a more promotion oriented approach that  for our clients  delivered a lower quality user profile that failed to achieve back end conversion levels consistent with client expectations 
we then looked to build the majority of our publisher network with impressions from non promotional oriented sites that will yield a better lead for our clients 
the number of page impressions for core placements and other placements for the year ending december  increased to million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for the comparable period in the increase in page impressions was the result of adding more publishers to the aptimus network and adding additional placements within existing publisher websites 
we expect the average revenue per thousand impressions of both our core and other placements to be consistent with their respective current levels over the long term while they each might fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on the mix of publishers added to our network and the specific placements within those publishers as well as the mix and relative values of our offer inventory 
our plan remains to continue our efforts to expand our network with new distribution publishers  client offers and product types and placements 
we expect that these efforts will result in the continued growth in our revenues 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of fees to web site publishers and email list owners participating in our network 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  cost of revenues has increased primarily as a result of the increase in total revenue 
cost of revenues have also increased on a percentage of revenue basis  as a result of the growth in web site network revenues compared to email based revenues 
the effective rate at which we share revenues for email based revenue is lower than that of website network based revenues 
so  as email revenues declined year over year  the percentage of revenue paid to our publishers increased 
during  we also experimented with paying network publishers on a cost per thousand impressions basis  which has contributed to the increase in costs as a percentage of revenue for the year 
cost of revenues for is expected to increase further as a percentage of revenues and is expected to normalize at around of revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing and operational personnel costs  bad debts  and outside sales costs 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a result of the hiring of additional personnel  costs of trade shows and their related marketing and travel expenses and outside services related to the operation of our email division  neighbornet 
these items accounted for  and of the increase in expense  respectively 
during  the number of sales and marketing employees increased by people 
also in  we hosted a booth at three of the major direct marketing trade shows 
we did not have a booth at any trade shows in going forward  sales and marketing costs are expected to increase as additional employees are hired and new employee stock option expense rules take effect 
however  sales and marketing expense is not expected to increase as a percentage of revenues 
connectivity and network costs 
connectivity and network costs consist of expenses associated with the maintenance and usage of our network as well as email delivery costs 
such costs include internet connection charges  hosting facility costs  email delivery costs and personnel costs 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of additional fees paid to outside vendors related to our quality initiative that has resulted in the addition of several new types of lead validations such as full lead confirm and call confirm validations 
data verification costs are unique to each specific offer in our network and will vary from month to month depending on the number of offers requiring this service 
connectivity and network costs for are expected to increase slightly as additional costs are incurred for data validation  annual pay increases and also as a result of the expensing of employee stock options 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs related to maintaining and enhancing the features  content and functionality of our web sites  network and related systems 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  this increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases in labor costs 
the increase in labor costs was due to the hiring of an additional developer in the first quarter of research and development expense for is expected to be slightly higher than levels in as a result of annual pay increases and also as a result of the expensing of employee stock options 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of management  financial and administrative personnel expenses and related costs and professional service fees 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  the majority   of the increase in general and administrative expense was due to increases in outside services related to compliance with sarbanes oxley and increases in audit fees 
total general and administrative expenses for are expected to be somewhat lower than as the company has now completed its first internal controls assessment and the remediation work discussed in item a of this annual report 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on leased and owned computer equipment  software  office equipment and furniture and amortization on intellectual property and purchased email lists 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased in as additional computer equipment and software was purchased 
we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense in to continue to increase slightly as compared to as the company plans on spending approximately  on improvements and upgrades to its computer hardware and software 
loss gain on disposal of long term assets 
loss gain on disposal of long term assets primarily consists of an impairment charge taken on the neighbornet assets that were acquired in may no material gains or losses are expected in interest expense 
there is no interest expense in the current year  as the company had no amounts outstanding under capital equipment leases or other debt instruments 
interest expense is expected to be zero in as well 
interest income 
interest income results from earnings on our available cash reserves 
interest income totaled  in the year ended december  and  in the increase in interest income is primarily a result of our improved cash position resulting from the proceeds from the sale of common stock in march and the positive cash flow generated by operations during the interest income is expected to increase slightly in as the company s cash position is expected to continue to improve and interest rates are expected to continue to increase 
income taxes 
no provision for federal income taxes has been recorded for any of the periods presented due to taxable losses incurred in those years 
the company has provided full valuation allowances on the related net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realizability 
as of december   approximately million of net operating losses remain for federal income tax reporting purposes 
we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions  has occurred and may substantially limit the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of million in net operating losses before utilization 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues

we source our results based leads from two primary network sources web sites and email lists 
for the year ended december   leads derived from email list sources accounted for million or of our overall revenue compared to million or for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our average revenue per thousand impressions for our core placements increased to per thousand impressions compared to for the comparable period in our average revenue per thousand impressions for our other placements for the year ended december  increased to from for the comparable period in the number of page impressions for core placements and other placements for the year ending december  increased to million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for the comparable period in the increase in page impressions was the result of adding more publishers to the aptimus network and adding additional placements within existing publisher websites 
in addition  the average revenue per thousand impressions for our core placements increased as a result of further refinements to our dynamic revenue optimization technology and a higher performing offer mix 
the average revenue per thousand impressions for our other placements increased slightly also as a result of further refinements to our dynamic revenue optimization technology and a higher performing offer mix 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of fees to web site publishers and email list owners participating in our network 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage inc dec 
year ended december  cost of revenues has increased primarily as a result of the increase in total revenue 
cost of revenues have increased on a percentage of revenue basis  as a result of the growth in web site network revenues outpacing the growth of our email based revenues 
the effective rate at which we share revenues for email based revenue is lower than that of web site network based revenues as a result of our ownership of a large portion of the names mailed and that we deduct the cost of delivering the emails before calculating the fees due publishers for email based revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of marketing and operational personnel costs  bad debts  and outside sales costs 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage increase year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a result of hiring of additional personnel  increases in sales commissions due to increased sales  accrual of a net income based bonus pool for the year  and increases in bad debt expense 
these items accounted for  and of the increase in expense  respectively 
the majority of the new employees in sales and marketing were in the business development department  which focuses on signing up new publishers 
bad debts increased due to an increase in the reserve and the write off of approximately  in accounts during the year 
connectivity and network costs 
connectivity and network costs consist of expenses associated with the maintenance and usage of our network as well as email delivery costs 
such costs include internet connection charges  hosting facility costs  email delivery costs and personnel costs 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage decrease year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of decreases in connectivity and email delivery costs  which were offset by increases in labor costs  maintenance agreement costs and address verification costs 
as a percentage of the total change in this account these factors accounted for    and  respectively 
the decrease in connectivity resulted from moving our network production environment in house 
in the first six months of  the network production environment was hosted by eds corporation 
similarly the decrease in email delivery costs was a result of moving the remaining email programs in house 
in  a third party performed the majority of the email delivery 
the increase in labor related costs is a result of pay reductions  which were in place in the first quarter of  the hiring of an additional network engineer during the quarter  and a net income based bonus that was accrued in in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  our existing employees agreed to a reduction in pay to improve our cash flows 
in the first quarter of  we paid our employees an amount equal to the reduction in pay they agreed to during these two quarters 
the increased maintenance is related to additional maintenance contracts on hardware and software 
address verification costs are campaign related and vary from month to month depending on the number of offers requiring this service 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs related to maintaining and enhancing the features  content and functionality of our web sites  network and related systems

in the first quarter of  we paid our employees an amount equal to the reduction in pay they agreed to during these two quarters  resulting in an increase in labor related costs in in addition there was also a bonus based on net income that was accrued in the primary other cause of the increase in general and administrative costs was an increase in business taxes paid 
these taxes are based on revenues for washington state and the city of seattle and gross payroll for the city of san francisco 
since both revenues and labor costs increased in the related tax liabilities also increased 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation on leased and owned computer equipment  software  office equipment and furniture and amortization on intellectual property and purchased email lists 
in thousands  except percentages of revenue of revenue percentage decrease year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense decreased in as additional computer equipment has become fully depreciated 
loss gain on disposal of long term assets 
loss gain on disposal of long term assets consists of gains and losses on disposals of assets and impairments on long term investments 
some computer hardware  furniture  and leasehold improvements were retired in the second quarter  however the majority of the assets were fully depreciated or insurance proceeds were received and no material gain or loss was recorded during no material gains or losses are expected in interest expense 
interest expense in the current year results from capital equipment leases and convertible notes payable 
interest expense totaled  for the year ended december  and  in interest expense is expected to be zero as the convertible notes payable were converted to common stock on march  and the capital equipment leases were paid in full in july interest income 
interest income results from earnings on our available cash reserves 
interest income totaled  in the year ended december  and  in the increase in interest income is primarily a result of our improved cash position resulting from the proceeds from the sale of common stock in december and the positive cash flow generated in the second half of income taxes 
no provision for federal income taxes has been recorded for any of the periods presented due to taxable losses incurred in those years 
the company has provided full valuation allowances on the related net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realizability 
as of december   approximately million of net operating losses remain for federal income tax reporting purposes 
we determined that a change in ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions  has occurred and may substantially limit the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources since we began operating as an independent company in july  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
net proceeds from the issuance of stock through december   totaled million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  providing working capital of million 
other than the deferred tax asset  as described more fully below  no off balance sheet assets or liabilities existed at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities consisted of years ended december  cash received from customers cash paid to employees and vendors interest received interest paid net cash provided by used in operations net cash used in investing activities was million and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december    was used to acquire fixed assets   was used to acquire the assets of neighbornet   was used to acquire intangible assets  and  was used to acquire short term investments 
for the year ended december   was used to acquire fixed assets   was used to acquire intangible assets  and  was provided by proceeds from disposal of fixed assets 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  resulted from the sale of million from the sale of stock in a private placement in march of and  from the issuance of stock in connection with the exercise of options  warrants and the employee stock purchase plan 
these sources of cash were offset by the payment of  of costs related to the march private placement 
net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  resulted from  in principal payments made on capital leases and  in payments made related to the registration of shares offset by  in proceeds from option and warrant exercises 
we believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
this is based on the cash generated by operations during the year ended december  and we currently anticipate spending  to  on capital expenditures in in order to expand and improve our network infrastructure 
should our goal of maintaining positive cash flow not be met  we may need to raise additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements 
our cash requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services and the extent to which we use cash for acquisitions and strategic investments 
although  no acquisitions or major strategic investments are currently planned  unanticipated expenses  poor financial results or unanticipated opportunities requiring financial commitments could give rise to earlier financing requirements 
in addition  we do not currently anticipate any expenditure outside the ordinary course of business in pursuing the market strategies described in this annual report 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our shareholders would be reduced  and these securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of business opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited  and we might need to significantly restrict our operations 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations and commercial commitments entered into by the company  in thousands 
payments due by period year ending december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases operating agreements total contractual obligations these commitments relate to the leasing of our offices in seattle and san francisco 
we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations 
these commitments relate to connectivity and collocation contracts 
we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements no off balance sheet arrangements existed as of december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe those areas subject to the greatest level of uncertainty are the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and depreciation of fixed and intangible assets 
in addition to those areas subject to the greatest level of uncertainty revenue recognition is also considered a critical accounting policy 
revenue recognition the company currently derives revenue from providing response based advertising programs through a network of web site distribution publishers 
revenue earned for response based advertising through the aptimus network is based on a fee per lead and is recognized when the lead information is delivered to the client 
revenue earned for email mailings can be based on a fee per lead  a percentage of revenue earned from the mailing  or a cost per thousand emails delivered 
revenue from email mailings delivered on a cost per thousand basis is recognized when the email is delivered 
revenues from email mailings sent on a fee per lead or a percentage of revenue earned from the mailing basis are recognized when amounts are determinable  generally when the customer receives the leads 
revenues generated through network publishers and opt in email list owners are recorded on a gross basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue number eitf 
fees paid to network publishers and opt in email list owners related to these revenues are shown as publisher fees on the statement of operations 
aptimus shares a portion of the amounts it bills its advertiser clients with the third party web site owners or publishers and email list owners on whose web properties and email lists aptimus distributes the advertisements 
while this revenue share approach is aptimus primary payment model  it will as a rare alternative pay web site owners either a fixed fee for each completed user transaction or a fee for each impression of an advertisement served on the web site 
email based campaigns that are sent to company owned lists do not have publisher fees associated with them 
going forward  due to the indefinite suspension of our email business  we do not expect to generate or  consequently  share any email related revenues 
the company has evaluated the guidance provided by eitf as it relates to determining whether revenue should be recorded gross or net for the payments made to network publishers and opt in email list owners 
the company has determined the recording of revenues gross is appropriate based upon the following factors aptimus acts as a principal in these transactions  aptimus and its customer are the only companies identified in the signed contracts  aptimus and its customer are the parties who determine pricing for the services  aptimus is solely responsible to the client for fulfillment of the contract  aptimus bears the risk of loss related to collections aptimus determines how the offer will be presented across the network  and amounts earned are based on leads or emails delivered and are not based on amounts paid to publishers 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
at december   our net deferred tax assets are million 
currently a valuation allowance equal to the balance of the deferred tax assets has been recorded 
this valuation allowance has been recorded  as the ability of the company to utilize the deferred tax assets has not been assessed as being more likely than not 
any change in the assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized will have a significant impact on the estimate of the valuation allowance 
we believe the impact of he section change in control limitations may result in an inability to fully remove the valuation allowance 
should the ability of the company to utilize the deferred tax assets not be assessed as more likely than not  no reduction in the valuation allowance would be made 
allowance for doubtful accounts the estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised of two parts  a specific account analysis and a general reserve 
accounts where specific information indicates a potential loss may exist are reviewed and a specific reserve against amounts due is recorded 
as additional information becomes available such specific account reserves are updated 
additionally  a general reserve is applied to the aging categories based on historical collection and write off experience 
as trends in historical collection and write offs change  the percentages applied against the aging categories are updated 
except where specific information indicates otherwise  the following rates were applied against the total balance due from the client when they had an amount in the applicable aging category as of the date the reserve analysis was performed as of december  current past due days past due days past due days past due greater than days additional metrics related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follow as of december  reserve balance of overall ar reserved days sales outstanding days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing net accounts receivable by revenue for the preceding quarter divided by the number of days in the preceding quarter 
as of december    of the reserve related to specifically identified accounts that are expected be uncollectible 
as of december   and  reserves were based on applying the standard rates to the aging categories as no specific accounts were identified as needing to be reserved 
over the past three years accounts receivable has increased and the allowance for doubtful accounts has remained relatively consistent 
this trend results from the recovery of the economic downturn that occurred in as a result of the economic downturn in  a large number of companies went out of business or filed for bankruptcy protection during and as a consequence of these events  the collectibility of our accounts receivable was reduced and we recorded additional reserves to properly value accounts receivable 
all of the accounts from this time period were written off or collected by the third quarter of as these problem accounts were addressed and written off or collected the reserve declined as a percentage of total accounts receivable 
we do not expect to see this trend continue but rather expect our overall reserve balance will stabilize around the range as the economy stabilizes 
prior to this challenging time  reserves were historically in the range of of accounts receivable 
as a result of our focus on credit and collections we believe the range is a more accurate expectation of reserve balances  although they could be reduced further or increase again should future information indicate a need to do so 
as of december   the reserve balance is higher than the expected range as a result of several accounts that have been identified as uncollectible that have not been written off as december  days sales outstanding has remained relatively consistent between days over the three years ended december  any increase in the rates used to calculate the reserve would result in the recognition of additional bad debts expense and reduce the net accounts receivable balance 
depreciation of fixed and intangible assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
equipment under capital leases  which all contain bargain purchase options  is recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments and is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows office furniture and equipment five years computer hardware and software three years leasehold improvements three to five years intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are as follows email names two years aptimus patents and trademarks three years the cost of normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major improvements are capitalized 
gains or losses on the disposition of assets in the normal course of business are reflected in operating expenses as part of the results of operations at the time of disposal 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in the event we determine that the useful life of a capital asset should be shortened we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value  over its remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
a review for impairment involves developing an estimate of undiscounted cash flow and comparing this estimate to the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow is based on  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance

sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued

this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee stock purchase plans espp will result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are not met 
as currently structured the company s espp plan will not meet those conditions and compensation will be recognized 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after january  early adoption is encouraged and retroactive application of the provisions of sfas to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date is permitted  but not required 
this statement will be implemented using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by statement the impact of adoption of this statement on net income is expected to be a reduction of  related to stock option grants issued prior to january  in the quarter ended march  total compensation related to such option grants is expected to be  for the year ended december  additionally  the impact of any realized excess tax benefits will be shown as financing cash inflows instead of operating cash inflows in future periods

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are at fixed interest rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   however  our cash equivalents mature within three months and our short term investment mature within one year 
as of december   we believe the reported amounts of cash equivalents to be reasonable approximations of their fair values 
as a result  we believe that the market risk and interest risk arising from its holding of financial instruments is minimal
