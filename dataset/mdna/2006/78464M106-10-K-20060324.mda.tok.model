circle surround decoding is available in three solutions circle surround  circle surround ii and circle surround automotive 
audio rendering our audio rendering technologies optimize device audio output and enable the presentation of d and multichannel audio content over two speakers 
these technologies include the ability to render multichannel content over two speakers  to create a wider sound stage for more natural audio  to improve the perceived bass response in small speakers  and to dynamically position audio sources in a virtual d space using headphones  and to reposition the audio image for non optimally placed speakers 
our audio technologies include srs xspace d  srs wow  srs wow xt  srs wow hd  srs trubass  srs focus  srs headphone  srs dialogclarity  srs trusurround xt  srs d sound and srs auto 
voice processing our vip and noise reduction technologies  dramatically reduce noise to produce much clearer and crisper dialog over wireless communication devices and improve the intelligibility of the human voice in a variety of listening situations  including high ambient background environments 
the srs labs portfolio of technologies can address a broad spectrum of product applications within the vertical markets that we have targeted 
our technologies may be implemented in a variety of methods  including discrete analog components  chip modules  analog semiconductors  dsps and software 
these various implementation options offer customers flexibility when incorporating our technologies into products 
semiconductors our fabless semiconductor business designs  develops and markets custom and proprietary analog  digital and mixed signal integrated circuits 
these products address a wide range of applications in the consumer electronics  home entertainment  telecommunications and personal computer markets 
we market our semiconductor products in two categories a custom asics for specific oem customers primarily in the asia pacific region  and b standard integrated circuits marketed under the brand name  asp microelectronics  or asp  many of which include our audio  voice and surround sound technologies 
as of the end of  approximately engineers supported our ic design capabilities 
we outsource the manufacturing of these asics to a network of fabrication partners throughout asia pacific  including chartered semiconductor  samsung and tower semiconductor limited in israel 
in addition to performing contract design work  we also design  develop and market standard ics for the asia pacific manufacturing market under the asp brand name 
the products created are based upon management s analysis of trends in the market  knowledge gained from long standing relationships with customers and overall business experience 
the general purpose integrated circuits offered include micro controllers for dvd players  set top box receivers and audio video equipment  ics for telecommunication and game equipment  small signal transistors and ics used mainly in the manufacture of consumer products such as television sets  radios  telephones  computer mother boards  add on boards and audio hi fi systems 
many of these products are developed by utilizing our custom design libraries  advanced mixed signal design technologies  system level expertise  software knowledge and understanding of customer requirements 
many of these chips include srs audio technologies and by the end of  of the asp product line included srs audio chips 
our customers and markets we license our technologies and sell our semiconductors throughout the western hemisphere  the asia pacific region and in europe 
the following table presents our revenue by geographic area 
for product sales  revenue is allocated based on the country to which product was shipped 
for licensing related revenue  the allocation is based on the location of the licensee s corporate headquarters 
the americas region includes north  central and south america 
years ended december  geographic area revenue hong kong japan korea china americas other asia pacific europe total licensing through our licensing business segment  we market our portfolio of technologies to the following vertical markets home entertainment  personal telecommunications  portable media  personal computers and automotive 
our license agreements typically have multi year or automatic renewal terms  and either require per unit royalty payments for all products implementing our technologies or provide for a fixed annual or quarterly royalty payment 
license agreements also specify the use of our trademarks and logos on the product  within the packaging and in the user s manual 
agreements also require our product review and approval to guarantee the quality of the technology implementation and the correct usage of our logos and trademarks 
we believe these terms ensure the quality and consistency of the technology and elevate the awareness of the srs brand in the marketplace 
most agreements do not have volume requirements and may be terminated by the licensees or us without substantial financial penalty 
commencing in  we embarked on a strategy to further diversify our concentration across markets 
the following chart shows the percentage of our licensing revenue we received in and from each of these markets 
graphic graphic home entertainment home entertainment products represent the largest current market for our technologies and have historically been the largest revenue contributor to our licensing business 
manufacturers in this market utilize our technologies to differentiate their products from their competitors while improving functionality and product performance 
in many instances  manufacturers license multiple technologies from us for multiple product lines and divisions 
product categories within this market include hd televisions such as lcd and plasma televisions  set top boxes  dvd players  audio video receivers  and complete home theater in a box systems 
televisions 
our audio technologies are widely used by television manufacturers as a differentiating feature and as a solution to audio challenges that manufacturers encounter 
as television makers continue to migrate from bulky tube models to thinner digital displays  manufacturers are finding that they have less room for speakers  which may compromise the overall audio quality of the television 
we provide manufacturers with patented solutions for accurately presenting surround sound  improving bass response  increasing dialog clarity  and creating a more natural sound stage 
these solutions improve the audio quality of the set without the expense of additional equipment or larger speakers 
in  our technologies continued to grow in popularity for use in flat panel tvs from lg  samsung  and sony 
dvd players set top boxes 
although they present surround sound content  dvd players and set top boxes are typically connected to two channel televisions 
our srs trusurround xt technology creates a surround sound experience over any existing two speaker system  including the internal speakers of a television 
this technology also creates a virtual surround experience from stereo material 
a v receivers home theater in a box 
the audio visual receiver is the central hub for a typical home theater system 
many homes are now being equipped with home theater in a box systems that come complete with a dvd player  vcr  cd player  set top box  and speakers 
our portfolio of technologies addresses the needs of this market by improving audio performance and by providing surround sound rendering 
personal telecommunications srs labs provides the personal telecommunications market with both voice and audio rendering technologies 
mobile phones are adding multimedia at a rapid pace 
new services include digital music downloads  ring tones and true tones  streaming video  gaming  and television viewing 
in and  kddi  sk telecom  sprint  and verizon joined ntt docomo and others with new multimedia services 
srs labs strong presence in the home entertainment market  our suite of voice technologies  and our existing start into the mobile market with customers like nec present a growth opportunity for srs labs 
srs solutions address specific needs in the mobile market 
for example  our technologies address needs like voice intelligibility in noisy environments  clarity of dialog in video content  poor bass response of small speakers  hampered stereo imaging in narrow set speakers  and d audio for interactive gaming 
portable media mp players and other portable media players enable consumers to enjoy audio and video content while on the go 
as volume for these devices increases  consumer pricing pressure leads to wider use of cost effective components by manufacturers to keep production costs low 
also  the small footprint of these devices limits speaker size and speaker spacing 
our solutions enable vendors of portable media devices to increase the quality of their audio output without increasing hardware component costs 
in  customers using srs technologies in their portable media player products included lg  reigncom iriver  and samsung 
personal computers personal computers pcs in the home are often used as media hubs 
through pcs  users enjoy and manage collections of music  and movies along with downloaded and recorded television programming 
this content is now being distributed through the home using networked media adapter products 
throughout these systems  there is a need for optimizing playback on the computer speakers  presenting a home theater experience on a laptop  transmitting surround sound around the home  and enjoying content on headphones 
technology solutions from srs are well positioned to fill these needs 
in  toshiba and fujitsu were among the customers using srs technologies in their personal computer and related products 
automotive srs labs has invested in research to create solutions specific to the needs of the automotive market 
within vehicles  audio and video content is played from multiple sources and then presented on both speakers and headphones 
stereo content from sources like cds  mp players  and hd radio needs to be presented on all speakers in the car  some of which may not be optimally placed and may not have strong bass response 
surround sound content from dvds  radio  and downloaded music needs to be rendered on both car speakers with a maximum sweet spot and on rear seat headphones 
our automotive solutions like srs cs auto  srs circle surround ii  and srs trusurround xt meet these needs and provide manufacturers in this segment with a fully tunable solution 
in  customers using our automotive technology included fujitsu ten  kenwood  and philips 
semiconductors our custom asic customers include the asia based manufacturing facilities for consumer electronics  telecommunications and personal computer manufacturers headquartered in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we believe our expertise in design work allows us to offer our customers a shorter development cycle  smaller die size and faster turnaround time for final production  which strengthens our relationships with our customers and helps us retain our competitive advantage in the asia pacific region 
our target customers for ics are the original design manufacturers  or odms and oems of a variety of television applications  including lcd  projection  crt and plasma televisions  as well as personal telecommunications  automotive  portable audio and personal computer equipment 
customer concentration for fiscal year  there was no customer that accounted for more than of consolidated revenues 
for fiscal year  one customer in the semiconductor segment accounted for approximately or  of consolidated revenues 
for fiscal year  one customer in the semiconductor segment accounted for approximately or  of consolidated revenues 
given the significant amount of revenues derived from these customers  the loss of any such customer or the uncollectibility of related receivables could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our strategy as explained above  we are pursuing the divestiture of our semiconductor business in order to focus on our licensing business 
consequently  the following discussion addresses the key elements of the strategy for our licensing business 
our sales strategy is to identify high growth markets  develop needed technology solutions and features and work with software and semiconductor platform partners to make these technologies widely available and easy to implement by oems and odms 
we believe that we will continue to strengthen our market position as a world leader in audio and voice technology by employing the strategy of providing a continuous stream of patented audio and voice technologies  penetrating new licensing accounts  expanding relationships with existing licensees  creating a broad platform of software and semiconductor partners and developing strong brand awareness of the srs logo 
the mission of our licensing platform efforts is to achieve comprehensive and strategic coverage for our technology solutions within all of our targeted vertical product markets in order to expand sales and licensing opportunities 
by developing strong relationships with the leading software and semiconductor companies  our audio technologies can be delivered to customers worldwide across high growth and high volume product applications 
we work together with our platform partners leading semiconductor manufacturers and middleware or firmware software providers to provide our mutual customers with the technology  which best fits their needs 
we also together solicit other customers who use the platform 
many times  a platform partner will become enabled with our technology due to a customer request 
other platforms become enabled with our technology due to their identification as a key component to enter a new market 
as a technology licensing company  one of our greatest assets is the strength of our brand 
since brand recognition drives licensing sales  we have invested in strategies that increase consumer awareness of srs labs with the ultimate goal of establishing our brand with both product manufacturers and consumers around the world as the symbol for high quality audio 
the three primary vehicles that we use to further the proliferation of our brand are a placement of the srs logo by oems on products and in co marketing programs  b online branding programs  and c use  and recognition of use  of srs technology by content and broadcast professionals 
oem marketing programs 
in the majority of products which use srs technologies  our logo is either prominently displayed on the product itself or  in the case of software products and mobile phones  featured in the graphical user interface 
this consistent logo exposure is considered a key tool in reaching consumers worldwide 
in addition  we work with our oem customers as they launch new products that feature srs technologies 
we supply complete srs corporate and technology tool kits with a wide array of material  including srs logos  illustrations  technology explanations and suggested demonstration material 
in  for example  we worked with dell to place srs circle surround encoded high definition video and our logo into their sales kiosks 
online branding 
online exposure has also been an important part of our branding strategy 
a beneficial component of our relationship with microsoft is that the srs logo displayed in the audio control panel of microsoft s windows media player links to an srs technology page 
as a result  srs has received significant traffic and opportunities to create brand awareness with consumers and to educate consumers on the benefits of srs technology 
our online efforts also include the direct sale of plug ins for windows media player 
revenue from the sale of these products is not significant  but gives us a valuable demonstration platform to showcase our audio technologies 
use of srs technology by content and broadcast professionals 
we develop  license and sell professional hardware and software products to enable content companies  broadcasters and music publishers to encode their material using our srs circle surround technology 
when srs circle surround is professionally used  the logo is often displayed within the content itself  on the packaging material  or in the case of radio an announcement that the broadcast is being delivered in srs circle surround 
we have concentrated on three key market segments in the professional audio space television  radio and music  and have developed a line of hardware and software products to address these markets 
these products are sold directly to professional customers and are also available from selected dealers and distributors servicing the professional audio and broadcast communities 
we did not generate significant revenue from the sale of professional hardware equipment in the primary purpose of this business is to enable our other businesses and to increase awareness for srs labs within the content community 
sales and marketing we have two types of revenue collection systems with our licensees bundled or non bundled 
under a bundled agreement  royalty revenue may be collected by our platform partner at the time the solution is sold to an oem or odm 
most often  however  we collect revenue directly from our licensees 
these licensing arrangements with oems or odms authorize them to design  build and sell products containing our technology 
under this licensing method  oem product licensees are free to choose a semiconductor solution from the platform partner that best suits their technical and cost of goods sold requirements 
we receive royalties directly from the licensed oem or odm for the use of our technologies in licensed products manufactured and shipped by the oem or odm 
many major oems have licenses or purchase products manufactured by a licensed odm for the use of one or more of our technologies and for the use and display of our trademarks 
in the case of the platform partner who bundles our technology within their solution  the cost of the solution includes our royalty at the time it is sold 
the platform partner remits that royalty directly back to us on behalf of the licensee  thus streamlining the royalty collection process of royalty reporting 
our process for selecting particular platform partners for distributing our technology is based on several criteria including a segment leadership we target chip partners that hold preeminent positions in market segments characterized by high growth  volume and or margins  b volume platforms which will maximize exposure of our technologies to a large number of potential oems  c synergy platforms which serve to position our technologies along with compatible and additive technologies for integrated delivery  and d convergence potential which enable us to establish a presence on platforms that intersect merging functional features 
an example of this would be the platforms for new personal multifunctional devices that include mobile phone  personal digital assistant  or pda  and mp capabilities 
to implement our licensing sales strategy within our identified vertical markets  we have established a direct sales force and a worldwide network of independent sales agents 
in north america  we employ a direct sales force to market our portfolio of audio and voice technologies to the oem community 
internationally  we maintain offices in japan  hong kong and korea to support our multi national oem customers 
we actively promote the use of our trademarks and logos and direct customers to prominently display the appropriate srs technology logo on products  packaging and in advertising 
we work closely with our licensees to enhance their success in selling finished products and semiconductor products that incorporate our technologies through a variety of licensee support programs 
these programs include engineering support  sales training  tradeshow support  publicity and media relations programs  customized marketing materials  advertising  speaking engagements and industry conferences 
where possible  we use the internet to provide technology demonstrations 
we conduct in person technology demonstrations or presentations for the press and other companies to promote our technologies and products 
we also regularly participate in tradeshows and conferences to increase awareness of our technologies and to market our technologies and products 
we work closely with our licensees and platform partners to actively explore additional opportunities to place our technologies in new products and or markets 
backlog backlog is applicable only to our semiconductor business 
sales of semiconductors are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of asic and ic products 
order quantities and delivery schedules are frequently changed to reflect product availability  scheduling at our fabrication partner facilities or changes in our customers needs 
customer orders can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
accordingly  our backlog at any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
for this reason  we believe that backlog is not generally a good indicator of future revenue 
as of december and  the backlog of orders for asic and ic products to non affiliated parties was  and  respectively 
we expect that all or substantially the entire current backlog of orders for will be completed in research and development our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuous improvement in products and services 
our research and development expenditures in   and were approximately  and of total operating expenses respectively 
these expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees and consultants engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies 
as of december   we had employees in our r d group representing of our total human resources 
our software  hardware and application engineers focus on developing intellectual property  technology solutions and consumer products 
twelve engineers are based in the us and support of our licensing business with the remaining engineers based in hong kong and support of our semiconductor business 
competition we compete in each of our business segments with a number of different companies  which produce a variety of technologies  processes and products 
licensing competition in the audio  voice and surround sound technology licensing business includes other licensing companies who offer competing technologies as well as the internal engineering department of our licensees  who may develop audio technologies for use in their own products 
in the field of audio improvement  we compete directly with other audio providers  including audistry by dolby  bbe sound  and qsound 
our d positional audio technology directly competes with technologies from qsound and synoptic 
we believe that our bass technology  trubass  competes directly with several technologies  including maxxbass from waves  ltd  vibe from spatializer  and non proprietary bass systems  such as bass boost  that are included on a variety of electronics products  including televisions  portable stereos and speaker products 
because our audio technologies work with any existing recorded material  whether mono  stereo or surround sound  most of our audio technologies  including srs d  srs focus  srs trubass and srs dialog clarity  can be used either as an alternative or as a complement to almost any competing audio technology 
our surround sound rendering technologies compete primarily with dolby virtual speaker and our surround sound format competes directly with the dolby prologic family 
however  our surround sound decoders and renderers are compatible with third party content formats  creating an opportunity for cooperation 
specifically  our surround sound decoders compete primarily with dolby prologic ii and dts neo many companies in the wireless and telecommunications industry are investigating methods to increase the quality of a voice signal  but we believe that their development work focuses on techniques to reduce noise and provide echo cancellation 
we are not aware of any direct competing technologies to our voice technology  vip  which processes the actual voice signal to improve intelligibility leveraging the nature of the human speech pattern 
vip is compatible to these other noise cancellation techniques 
many of the companies referenced above have  or may have  substantially greater resources than us to devote to advance their existing technologies and develop new products 
we believe that we compete based primarily on the quality and performance of our proprietary technologies  brand name awareness  the ease and cost of implementing our technologies  the ability to meet oems needs to differentiate their products  and the strength of our licensee relationships 
however  there can be no assurance that based on these factors  we will continue to be competitive with existing or future products or technologies of our competitors 
in the broadcast and professional audio markets  our circle surround technology competes directly with surround sound formats from dolby laboratories and dts  inc  which market professional products for the encoding and creation of multichannel content 
both of these companies have more established reputations  greater technical  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities and stronger brand presence in the movie cinema  television broadcast and music recording segments of professional audio 
these competitors also have established or may establish strategic relationships with potential customers of our circle surround technology that may affect our customers decisions to purchase products or license technology from us 
semiconductors the asia pacific semiconductor industry is dominated by several major suppliers  such as motorola  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
these established semiconductor companies usually do not offer custom design services to manufacturers and will only do so if the number of semiconductors required by such manufacturers is very large 
instead  they supply standard ic products to their customers 
we occasionally compete with smaller design houses in japan  taiwan or korea  such as sunplus  but most of these design houses are focused on standard semiconductor chip categories  such as random access memory  micro controller and other non proprietary functional processes 
we believe that our asic team is more flexible in its strategy of designing new products  as well as more responsive in the service provided to clients 
with years of experience in the asia pacific semiconductor market  our large accumulated design ip library can be reused for different designs and can support a shorter chip development cycle and a lower chip cost 
using our proprietary software  many of our designs can be re targeted for different foundries and processes  which allows us to reduce risk and cost 
we have strong in house testing capabilities  using state of the art software and hardware development tools 
we also believe that our expertise in local business practices and a strong franchise of relationships with clients gives us a competitive advantage over newcomers to the industry and large multi national firms 
our ability to develop standard ics that incorporate our audio technologies has opened up new chip sales opportunities  but could in the future cause channel conflict with our network of srs technology semiconductor partners 
our objective has been to minimize this conflict by concentrating our design and sales efforts on chip products for markets and product applications that are underserved by our existing semiconductor partners 
the markets in which we sell our products are also subject to significant price competition 
accordingly  we expect to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of our products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset declines in the selling prices of our products  we have been required to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts and other savings negotiated with our manufacturing subcontractors 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing facilities  we may not be able to reduce costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
our gross margins are affected by our ability to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or higher gross margin new products  and our ability to successfully manage our manufacturing subcontractor relationships 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information we operate in industries where innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of intellectual property rights are important for success 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and services  including patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual obligations 
we pursue a policy of enforcing such rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that our intellectual property rights will be adequate to ensure our competitive position  or that competitors will not be able to produce a non infringing competitive product or service 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us  or that if required to obtain any third party licenses as a result of an infringement dispute  we will be able to obtain such licenses 
although we believe that our patents and trademarks are important to each of our business segments  such patents and trademarks are especially important to the licensing business segments 
in order to protect the underlying technology concepts  we have filed and or obtained patents for all of our marketed technologies including technologies marketed under the trademarks srs  trusurround  trusurround xt  focus  circle surround  circle surround ii  wow  vip and trubass 
in addition  we have numerous issued patents and patents pending for speaker and other acoustic reproduction technologies 
we pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the united states and various foreign countries where our licensees manufacture  distribute or sell licensed products 
we continually update and add new applications to our patent portfolio to address changing worldwide market conditions and our new technological innovations 
the range of expiration dates for our patents extend between the years to we have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our technologies 
accordingly  the expiration of any single patent is not likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position or the ability to generate licensing revenue 
our strategy for protection of our trademarks identifying the various srs technology solutions is commensurate with our strategy for obtaining patent protection 
specifically  we routinely file us federal and foreign trademark applications for the various word names and logos used to market our technology solutions to licensees and the general public 
the duration of the us and foreign registered trademarks can typically be maintained indefinitely  provided proper maintenance fees are paid and trademarks are continually used or licensed by us 
seasonality due to the dependence of both our licensing and semiconductor businesses on the consumer electronics market  we experience seasonal fluctuation in sales and earnings 
in particular  we believe that the licensing business experiences seasonality relating to the christmas season in the fourth quarter  and the semiconductor business located in the asia pacific region experiences seasonality related to the chinese new year in the first quarter 
we have moved toward diversifying our key market segments in the consumer electronics industry in an effort to even out our seasonal fluctuation 
employees as of december   we employed persons  in finance and administration  in research and development  engineering and product development  and in sales and marketing 
of the employees  we employ individuals in our semiconductor business  in finance and administration  in research and development  engineering and product development  and in sales and marketing 
all of the semiconductor employees are located overseas 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are presently represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any labor problems or a work stoppage and believe we have good relations with our employees

risk factors we are exposed to risks in our licensing business related to product and customer concentration 
currently  our licensing revenue is concentrated in the home theater market with the majority of revenue generated from the inclusion of srs technology inside televisions  dvd players and set top boxes 
we expect that the consumer home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our licensing revenues for the foreseeable future 
while consumer spending in general on consumer electronic products has increased  retail prices for certain consumer electronics products that include our audio technology  such as dvd players  have decreased significantly 
indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  certain of our oem and semiconductor manufacturer customers may account for a significant portion of revenue from a particular product application  such as dvd players  set top boxes or televisions 
consumer electronics products manufacturers could decide to exclude our audio rendering technology from their home theater products altogether in an effort to reduce cost 
the loss of any such customer could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is highly dependent on the consumer electronics market  which is characterized by short product life cycles  fluctuations in demand and seasonality  and is subject to risks related to product transitions and supply of other components 
the consumer electronics market is characterized by intense competition  rapidly evolving technology  and ever changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles and significant price competition 
the dynamic nature of this market limits our  as well as our customers ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
if we  or our customers  are unable to manage product transitions  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
pricing pressures on the consumer electronics product manufacturers  who incorporate our technologies into their products  could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies  which could adversely affect our revenues 
the markets for the consumer electronics products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
retail prices for consumer electronics products that include our technologies  such as dvd players and home theater systems  have decreased significantly  and we expect prices to continue to decrease for the foreseeable future 
in response  manufacturers have sought to reduce their product costs  which can result in downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge our customers who incorporate our technologies 
a decline in the licensing fees we charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations  particularly in asia and the people s republic of china 
we have significant operations in hong kong  the people s republic of china prc and other parts of asia that require refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in those regions 
our operations in asia  and international operations in general  are subject to risks of unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements 
our customers geographically located in the asia pacific markets accounted for approximately   and of total company sales in  and  respectively and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of sales in the future 
the economic climate in asia continues to be impacted by increases in unemployment  declines in consumer spending  currency devaluation and bank failures 
any of these factors  should they continue  could significantly reduce the demand for the end user goods in which our products and technologies are used 
the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
there can be no assurance that such growth will continue or that any potential currency devaluation in the region will not have a negative effect on our business  including valence 
the prc economy has also experienced deflation in the past  which may continue in the future 
the current economic situation may adversely affect our profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation 
hong kong is a special administrative region of the prc with its own government and legislature 
hong kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the prc under the principle of one country  two systems 
it is possible that hong kong may not continue to enjoy autonomy from the prc 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since since mid  interest rates in hong kong have fluctuated significantly and real estate and retail sales have declined 
it is possible that the hong kong economy may deteriorate or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar may not be maintained 
continued declining consumer spending in hong kong  deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect our business 
our ability to generate revenues and meet with customers may be effected by widespread illness widespread illnesses such as the sars illness and the avian influenza  or asia bird flu  could impact our operations or our consumer electronics licensee s operations 
for example  our ability to visit our customers  our ability to conduct sales meetings or presentations  and sell through rates of electronics products to end consumers may be dramatically effected by either widespread or perceived potential illnesses 
we are uncertain of the total costs associated with the planned divestiture of valence 
in order for us to focus on our licensing business  our board approved on february  the sale of our semiconductor business 
in connection with such sale  the company may incur cash and non cash accounting charges  which at the present cannot be reasonably estimated 
the timing and amount of the net charges may have a negative impact to the statement of operations 
if the sale of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies does not grow in emerging markets  our ability to increase our licensing revenue may be limited 
we also expect that growth in our licensing revenue will depend  in part  upon the growth of sales of consumer electronics products incorporating our technologies in other countries  including china and india  as consumers in these markets have more disposable income and are increasingly purchasing entertainment products with surround sound capabilities 
however  if our licensing revenue from the use of our technologies in these new markets or geographic areas does not expand  our prospects could be adversely affected 
we have a long and unpredictable sales cycle  which can result in uncertainty and delays in generating additional revenues 
historically  because of the complexity of our technologies  it can take a significant amount of time and effort to explain the benefits of our technologies and to negotiate a sale 
for example  it typically takes six to nine months after our first contact with a prospective customer before we start licensing our technology to that customer 
in addition  purchases of our products are usually made in connection with new design starts  the timing of which is outside of our control 
accordingly  we may be unable to predict accurately the timing of any significant future sales of our products 
we may also spend substantial time and management attention on potential license agreements that are not consummated  thereby foregoing other opportunities 
if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we have filed numerous us and foreign patent applications and to date have a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us it is possible that third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel  we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives 
our future success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of key personnel  including engineering  sales and marketing staff  and highly skilled semiconductor design staff 
we anticipate that any future growth will require us to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and it is possible that we may not be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel to operate our business and support future growth 
the market price of our common stock is volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  strategic alliances between us and third parties  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business  or relating to us specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
even though our stock is quoted on the nasdaq stock market  our stock has had and may continue to have low trading volume and high volatility 
the historically low trading volume of our stock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume  either up or down  will significantly impact the stock price 
since our shares are thinly traded  our shareholders may have difficulty selling our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage  delay or prevent change in control 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we face intense competition from companies with greater brand recognition and resources 
the digital audio  consumer electronics  and entertainment markets are intensely competitive  subject to rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater name recognition  a longer operating history  more developed distribution channels and deeper relationships with semiconductor and consumer electronics products manufacturers  a more extensive customer base  broader product and service offerings  greater resources for competitive activities  such as research and development  strategic acquisitions  alliances  joint ventures  sales and marketing  and lobbying industry and government standards  and more technicians and engineers 
as a result  these current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards  or customer requirements

in september  we entered into a strategic alliance with coming home studios llc  or chs to use and promote srs labs technologies  promote chs productions and to promote each company s respective brands 
in connection with the strategic alliance  the company and chs established a joint venture  chs srs  llc  or the joint venture  to produce and distribute six concert videos by duran duran  boz scaggs  godsmack and all access featuring our circle surround technology  or the concert videos 
initially  coming home studios llc was the manager of the chs srs joint venture  however  due to the company s concerns about production delays and completion risks with respect to the concert videos  the company became manager of the chs srs joint venture in july  as a result of becoming the manager of  and providing financial support to the joint venture  the company was required under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  to consolidate the financial statements of the joint venture into our financial statements commencing with the third quarter of fiscal in the consolidated financial statements  all inter company accounts and transactions between the company and the joint venture have been eliminated 
previously  we accounted for our equity ownership in the joint venture as an investment using the equity method 
in february  our board of directors  or the board  authorized management to take all reasonable steps to divest our entire equity interest in the joint venture 
we have not yet estimated the costs we will incur in connection with the divestiture of our equity interest in the joint venture 
in addition  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to our investment in the joint venture  which is included in our consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended december  see critical accounting policies valuation of long lived assets impairment  herein 
the impairment charge was determined based on a sales to date and expected future net cash flows to the company from the joint venture  and b the estimated cost to complete the remaining three unreleased concert videos and their expected sales once completed 
because the impairment does not relate to cash charges  we do not expect the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures  except for certain legal and accounting expenses related to the disposition of our interest in the joint venture 
because we are required to consolidate the financial statements of the joint venture  the impairment amount has been recorded as a  charge to cost of goods sold principally related to a write down of capitalized production costs  a  charge to general and administrative expenses  and a  charge to write off our remaining investment in the joint venture which is included in other income expense 
the amounts included in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  as write off of investment in llc  reflects the company s capital contribution of  capitalized costs associated with the joint venture of  its proportionate share of profit from the joint venture of  and the consolidated net equity of the llc in the amount of  semiconductor through valence technology limited  a hong kong company and its subsidiaries  which we collectively refer to as valence  we operate a fabless semiconductor company which develops  designs and markets standard and custom  analog  dsps  and mixed signal  integrated circuits primarily to oems and odms in the asia pacific region 
in february  the board approved a plan to sell valence in order to focus increased management attention and financial resources on what it believes to be a larger and expanding market opportunity for its licensing business 
as a result of our decision to sell valence  we will account for the semiconductor business segment as a discontinued operation beginning in the quarter ending march  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts operating expenses  valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  valuation of intangible assets and capitalization of software  which primarily impacts operating expenses when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision 
we discuss each of these policies below  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience and the age of past due receivables 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers may require additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we periodically assess our inventory for potential obsolescence and lower of cost or market issues 
we make estimates of inventory obsolescence  providing reserves when necessary  based on  among other factors  demand for inventory based on backlog  product pricing  the ability to liquidate or sell older inventory  and the impact of introducing new products 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional provisions may be required 
intangible assets capitalization of software in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our adoption of sfas however  no assurances can be given that future evaluation of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  all of our intangible assets that have definite lives are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
costs paid by us related to the establishment and transfer of patents  primarily legal costs  are capitalized and amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years  depending on the estimated life of the technology patented 
consideration for the purchase of assets in excess of the fair market value of specifically identified tangible assets has been capitalized as intangible and is being amortized over periods ranging from three to years depending on the useful life of the asset 
we annually evaluate the recoverability of our patents and intangible assets based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
should the carrying value of patents or intangible assets exceed the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the expected periods of benefit  such assets will be written down to fair value 
costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as part of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalize software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software  provided that capitalized amounts will be realized over a period not exceeding five years 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense 
the establishment of technological feasibility and ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenues  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
under sfas no 
 annual amortization of software development costs are equal to the greater of a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
we are using the straight line method of amortization because the software can be used for many products and the estimates required to be made under the ratio that current gross revenues for products bear to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product could result in under reporting of expense 
upon the general release of the software product to customers  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized to cost of sales using the straight line method on a product by product basis over the estimated life  which is generally three years 
to the extent that amounts capitalized for software development costs become impaired due to a decline in demand or the introduction of new technology  such amounts will be written off 
all other research and development expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets with finite lives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses potential impairments to its long lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
as discussed further in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  based upon our most recent assessment as of december   we have determined there was a million impairment in the value of our investment in the joint venture 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the countries in which we operate 
the process used to make these estimates includes an assessment of the current tax expense  the results from tax examinations and the effects of temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of transactions for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and loss and credit carry forwards 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of their realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting either in a tax benefit  if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely  or a reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets  if it is determined that their value is impaired  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted

key topics covered by sab include a valuation models sab reinforces the flexibility allowed by sfas no 
r to choose an option pricing model that meets the standard s fair value measurement objective  b expected volatility sab provides guidance on when it would be appropriate to rely exclusively on either historical or implied volatility in estimating expected volatility  and c expected term the new guidance includes examples and some simplified approaches to determining the expected term under certain circumstances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting investment earnings 
foreign currency international sales represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of our licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
valence s operations are in hong kong and customers in the prc  and  accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for valence 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since to date  most of our semiconductor revenue and expenses incurred have been denominated in hong kong dollars 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were not significant in fiscal   and cash balances maintained by valence in excess of normal operating requirements are invested in us denominated bank accounts further reducing balance sheet exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
under the current circumstances  we believe that the foreign currency market risk is not material  however  it is possible that the hong kong economy may worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar not be maintained 
we actively monitor our foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intend to implement strategies to reduce our risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
it is possible that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will not be successful 
interest rates our exposure to market risk includes changes in interest rates  which relates primarily to our invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our investment policy specifies excess funds are to be invested in a manner that preserves capital  provides liquidity and generates the highest available after tax return 
to limit exposure to market risk  we place our cash in banks  cash equivalents in high quality  short term commercial paper and money market funds and investments consisting of us government securities and u 
s government backed securities 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
all cash  cash equivalents and investments are carried at fair value  which approximates cost
