item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the ten largest truckload carriers in the united states measured by revenue according to transport topics  a publication of the american trucking associations 
we focus on targeted markets where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage 
we are in the process of building our operations around four major transportation service offerings expedited team service  refrigerated service  dedicated service  and regional solo driver service 
we are a major carrier for transportation companies such as freight forwarders  less than truckload carriers  and third party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses  as well as for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers and retailers 
recent results and year end financial condition for the year ended december   total revenue increased  to million from million during the increase was attributable to an increase in fuel surcharge revenue 
freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  decreased  to million in from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year compared with million  or per diluted share  for our results included a pretax million adjustment to claims reserves  which reduced earnings per diluted share by approximately 
excluding the effect of the claims adjustment in described above  our after tax costs increased approximately on a per mile basis in  or approximately per mile  compared to the main factors were an approximately 
per mile increase in compensation expense  driven primarily by increases in driver pay in the second half of and in march and april of  an approximately per mile increase in insurance and claims expense primarily based on higher actuarial accrual rates  and a 
per mile increase in fuel cost net of fuel surcharge recovery 
in addition  the decrease in miles per tractor affected our cost per mile in fixed costs 
during we experienced significant fluctuations in our financial results 
in the first half of  we experienced a meaningful reduction in freight volumes from our customers 
we believe the reduction in freight volumes was attributable to the frequency and magnitude of rate increases we had implemented in  particularly equipment detention charges 
in the second half of  we began to regain freight volumes 
by the fourth quarter  our operating results improved significantly 
the table below reflects the quarterly fluctuations in freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  and diluted earnings per share 
quarter ended march june september december average freight revenue per tractor per week diluted earnings loss per share at december   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of and a book value of per share 
we also had million in undrawn letters of credit posted with insurance carriers 
at december   we had a combined million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and securitization facility 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
prior to  we measured freight revenue  before fuel and accessorial surcharges  in addition to total revenue 
in  we reclassified accessorial revenue  other than fuel surcharges  into freight revenue  and our historical financial statements have been conformed to this presentation 
we continue to measure revenue before fuel surcharges  or freight revenue  because we believe that fuel surcharges tend to be a volatile source of revenue 

table of contents we believe the exclusion of fuel surcharges affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
we operate tractors driven by a single driver and also tractors assigned to two person driver teams 
over time  the percentage of our revenue generated by driver teams has trended down  although the mix depends on a variety of factors over time 
our single driver tractors generally operate in shorter lengths of haul  generate fewer miles per tractor  and experience more non revenue miles  but the lower productive miles are expected to be offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced expense of compensating only one driver 
we expect operating statistics and expenses to shift with the mix of single and team operations 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment and operating terminals 
in addition  we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel 
the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past three years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the us economy has expanded  many trucking companies have been able to raise freight rates to cover the increased costs 
this is primarily due to a favorable relationship between freight demand and industry wide capacity of tractors and trailers 
for  our costs excluding the effect of the claims adjustment in the fourth quarter of rose faster than revenue because of the company specific decline in freight volumes during the first half of we believe the reason for the decline has been addressed 
accordingly  we expect increases in revenue per tractor to exceed increases in costs so long as freight demand continues to exceed truck capacity  excluding any additional company specific issues we may face  including issues we may encounter during our business realignment 
revenue equipment we operate approximately  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors  at december   approximately  were owned   were financed under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers  at december   approximately  were owned and approximately  were financed under operating leases 
we finance a portion of our tractor fleet and most of our trailer fleet with off balance sheet operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers 
in september  we entered into an agreement with a finance company to lease approximately  model year and dry van trailers under seven year walk away leases 
these trailers will replace approximately  model years and dry van trailers and approximately model year dry van trailers 
the  trailers will be replaced over the next year as new trailers are delivered 
after the completion of this transaction  our oldest trailers in operation will be model year trailers 
for  we plan to replace approximately  tractors  or approximately of our company owned tractor fleet 
this is approximately twice the number of tractors we would normally replace and will result in a substantial increase over normal replacement capital expenditures 
we are increasing our purchases in to afford us flexibility to evaluate the cost and performance of tractors equipped with engines that meet emissions requirements 
independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the payments to independent contractors and the financing of equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using net margin as well as operating ratio 

table of contents business realignment and outlook for in mid  we began the process of formally realigning our operations around four major transportation service offerings expedited team service  refrigerated service  dedicated service  and regional solo driver service 
the realignment has involved significant changes  including selecting and installing new leadership over each service offering  reassigning personnel  allocating tractors and trailers to each service offering  migrating operations to preferred traffic lanes for each service offering  acquainting drivers and customers to new lanes  contacts  and procedures  and developing systems to support  measure  and hold accountable each service offering 
although we have made significant progress  this process will continue at least into initial results of the business realignment on each service offering include the following expedited team service 
focused attention on teams has produced a substantial increase in average length of haul  average miles per tractor  and average freight revenue per tractor 
as a result of greater productivity  the previous decline in team driven tractors has stabilized 
refrigerated service 
prioritizing certain lanes and the allocation of teams to this service offering increased average length of haul  average miles per tractor  and average revenue per tractor 
in addition  we are increasing the allocation of tractors to this service offering 
dedicated service 
there has been essentially no change in dedicated service because of the longer contract duration 
in addition  we are continuing to evaluate individual candidates to manage this business 
regional solo driver service 
this service offering is our largest and is in the beginning stages of significant changes in its operating lanes and territories  freight mix  personnel  and policies and procedures 
over the long term we expect these changes to result in a shorter average length of haul and an increase in average freight revenue per tractor 
however  interim results may fluctuate substantially 
we expect to allocate trucks to other service offerings until the operating results of this service offering improve and become more consistent 
our business realignment presents numerous challenges and may result in volatile financial performance or periods of unprofitable results 
we believe our results will be most volatile during the first half of however  fluctuations in results may be ongoing as major activities within the realignment will continue at least into for  we are expecting a continuation of the favorable relationship between freight demand and trucking capacity that has allowed significant rate increases over the past two years 
we also expect average fuel prices to approximate the average levels in based on these expectations and assuming meaningful progress with our realignment  our financial performance in should improve significantly compared with  with most of the improvement coming in the second half of the year 

table of contents results of operations for comparison purposes in the table below  we use freight revenue  or total revenue less fuel surcharges  in addition to total revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe excluding this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue excludes million   million and million of fuel surcharges in each of   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to total revenue and freight revenue total revenue freight revenue operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses fuel expense fuel expense operations and maintenance operations and maintenance revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims insurance and claims communications and utilities communications and utilities general supplies and expenses general supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment total operating expenses total operating expenses operating income operating income other expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income tax expense cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income net income freight revenue is total revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in freight revenue excludes million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million in for comparison purposes  in the discussion below we use freight revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue 
we believe removing this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharges decreased million  to million in  from million in average freight revenue per tractor per week  a key statistic that we use to evaluate our asset productivity  increased to  in from  in our average freight revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a increase in average freight revenue per loaded mile  which was partially offset by lower miles per tractor and an increase in our percentage of non revenue miles 
our rates have increased primarily due to a strong freight market  tightened truck capacity  a decrease in our average length of haul  and an improvement in our freight selection 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 

table of contents salaries  wages  and related expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses increased to in  from in driver pay increased million  to of freight revenue in from of freight revenue in the increase was largely attributable to mileage pay increases and new retention bonus programs 
a driver retention bonus program went into effect in september  and mileage pay increases went into effect in march and april if the shortage of qualified drivers continues  additional driver pay increases may be necessary in the future 
our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers remained relatively constant at of freight revenue in and health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits increased to of freight revenue in from of freight revenue in partially due to higher payroll taxes and an increase in our health insurance claims 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  remained relatively constant at million in and million in fuel prices increased sharply during from already high levels during as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and in our fuel surcharge program was able to offset a substantial portion of the higher fuel prices 
fuel surcharges amounted to per revenue mile in and per revenue mile in fuel costs may be affected in the future by price fluctuations  supply shortages  volume purchase commitments  the terms and collectibility of fuel surcharges  the percentage of miles driven by independent contractors  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that have resulted in less fuel efficient engines 
at december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
operations and maintenance  which consists primarily of vehicle maintenance and repairs and driver recruitment expenses  increased million  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance increased to of freight revenue from in the increase resulted in part from increased tire costs  unloading costs  and increased driver recruiting expense due to a tighter supply of drivers 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the percentage of our total miles driven by independent contractors  which more than offset an increase in revenue equipment rental payments 
payments to independent contractors decreased million  to million in from million in  mainly due to a decrease in the independent contractor fleet to an average of trucks in from an average of in we have experienced difficulty in retaining our independent contractors due to the challenging operating conditions 
tractor and trailer equipment rental and other related amounts increased million  to million in  compared to million in we had approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases at december   compared with  tractors and  trailers financed at december  although we ended the year with fewer pieces of equipment financed through lease agreements  during we averaged more equipment financed through lease agreements than during operating taxes and licenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease partially resulted from a property tax settlement of approximately million relating to the tax year 
as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and in insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims expense decreased to in from in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an million non cash increase to our reserves for casualty claims 
excluding the million increase to reserves  insurance and claims increased to as a percentage of freight revenue from as a percentage of freight revenue 
the increase as a percentage of freight revenue was attributable to a higher actuarial accrual rate based on historical trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  premium expenses  and our level of self insured retention and may cause our insurance and claims expense to be higher or more volatile in future periods than in historical periods 
during the first quarter of  we renewed our casualty program through february in general  for casualty claims after march   we have insurance coverage up to million per claim 
we are self insured for personal injury and property damage claims for amounts up to million per occurrence  subject to an additional million self insured aggregate amount  which results in the total self insured retention of up to million until the million aggregate threshold is reached 
we are self insured for cargo loss and damage claims for amounts up to million per occurrence 

table of contents communications and utilities remained relatively constant at million in and million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained constant at in and general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  increased million  or  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses increased to in from in the increase is due to our paying for physicals and drug tests for our drivers  which in the past were paid for by the drivers  an increase in our travel expenses related to customer visits  and an increase in our bad debt allowance related to two customers 
one customer is in mediation and the other customer announced a planned liquidation 
depreciation and amortization expense  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the disposal of tractors and trailers 
the decrease in depreciation as a percentage of revenue was attributable to gains on the disposal of tractors and trailers of approximately million in compared to a loss of million in  an increase in the average percentage of our tractor and trailer fleet comprised of leased equipment  and increases in revenue per tractor  which more efficiently spread this fixed cost 
depreciation expense is expected to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods  due to a shift toward owned rather than leased equipment  and increased preparation costs related to a large planned trade package for of approximately  trailers and approximately  tractors 
the trade in preparation costs will be reflected as a component of gains losses on disposition of assets 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions 
goodwill amortization ceased beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment annually 
during the second quarter of  we tested our goodwill million for impairment and found no impairment 
the other expense category includes interest expense  interest income  and pre tax non cash gains or losses related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
other expense  net  increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  other expense increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and higher debt balances 
in  we accrued a million interest charge related to a proposed disallowed irs transaction 
we recorded a million pre tax  non cash gain in compared to a gain of million in  related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented in due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 
we recorded a million  net of tax  adjustment related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in december  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the adoption of fin resulted in our recording an asset retirement obligation for the estimated costs for the de identification obligations in certain of our equipment leases 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased million  or  to million in from million in as a result of the foregoing  our net margin increased to in from in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in freight revenue excludes million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million in for comparison purposes in the discussion below  we use freight revenue when discussing changes as a percentage of revenue

accordingly  maintenance costs have decreased 
the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets decreased substantially during and remained relatively low during at december   the average age of our tractor and trailer fleets was approximately and months  respectively 
the maintenance savings are expected to be partially offset by increased driver recruiting expense due to the greater demand for trucking services and a tighter supply of drivers

liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant capital investments 
in recent years  we have financed our capital requirements with borrowings under credit facilities  cash flows from operations  and long term operating leases 
our primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  proceeds under the securitization facility and borrowings under our credit agreement  each as defined in notes and to our consolidated financial statements contained herein  and operating leases of revenue equipment 

table of contents over the past several years  we have financed a large percentage of our revenue equipment through operating leases 
this has reduced the net value of revenue equipment reflected on our balance sheet  reduced our borrowings  and increased our net cash flows compared to purchasing all of our revenue equipment 
certain items could fluctuate depending on whether we finance our revenue equipment through borrowings or through operating leases 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins  to be approximately to million in  exclusive of acquisitions of companies  assuming all revenue equipment is purchased 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and projected needs for at least the next twelve months 
on a longer term basis  based on anticipated future cash flows  expected availability under our credit agreement and securitization facility  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in our primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income increased by depreciation and amortization 
our number of days sales in accounts receivable has increased to days in from days in due to difficulty in resolving and collecting detention accessorial revenue related to the hours of service regulations that went into effect in net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the net cash was used was primarily for the acquisition of new revenue equipment net of trade ins using proceeds from the credit agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in and million in during  outstanding balance sheet debt increased by million 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million  consisting of million in the securitization facility and million drawn under the credit agreement 
we used approximately million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock 
in may  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan for up to million company shares to be purchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions subject to criteria established by the board 
during  we purchased a total of  shares with an average price of 
the stock repurchase plan expires june  and replaced the stock repurchase program adopted in material debt agreements in december  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks  the credit facility 
the facility matures in december borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage the applicable margin was at december  
at december   we had only libor borrowings totaling million outstanding  with a weighted average interest rate of 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and all of our subsidiaries except crc and volunteer 
the credit agreement has a maximum borrowing limit of million with an accordion feature  which permits an increase up to a maximum borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or the maximum borrowing limit 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit agreement is secured by a pledge of the stock of most of our subsidiaries 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity 
at december  and december   we had undrawn letters of credit outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness and are cross defaulted with our securitization facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the credit agreement covenants

as of december   we were in compliance with the securitization facility covenants 
sale leaseback transactions in april  we expect to complete a sale leaseback transaction involving a major portion of our chattanooga facility  including our corporate headquarters 
in the transaction  we plan to sell the headquarters  maintenance facility  body shop  and approximately acres of surrounding property for approximately million 
we expect to lease the facilities back under a year lease with annual rental of approximately million  subject to annual increases of 
we expect to have options to extend the lease for years after the initial term and an option to purchase for fair market value 
in september  we entered into an agreement with a finance company to lease approximately  model year and dry van trailers under seven year walk away leases 
these trailers will replace approximately  model years and dry van trailers and approximately model year dry van trailers 
the  trailers will be replaced over the next year as new trailers are delivered 
after the completion of this transaction  the oldest trailer we will be operating will be a model year trailer 
in april  we engaged in a sale leaseback transaction involving approximately  dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers to a finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the trailers back under three year walk away leases 
the resulting gain was approximately million and is being amortized over the life of the lease 
the monthly cost of the lease payments will be higher than the cost of the depreciation and interest expense  however  there will be no residual risk of loss at disposition 
in april  we also entered into an agreement with a finance company to sell approximately  dry van trailers and to lease an additional  model year dry van trailers 
we sold the trailers  which consisted of model year to model year dry van trailers  to the finance company for approximately million in cash and leased the  dry van trailers back under seven year walk away leases 
the monthly cost of the lease payments will be higher than the cost of the depreciation and interest expense  however  there will be no residual risk of loss at disposition 
the transaction was completed in the first quarter of and the leases begin to expire in june

substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
the tractor lease agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles 
lease terms for tractors and trailers range from to months and to months  respectively 
refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements and note  leases  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
this amount represents volume purchase commitments through our truck stop network 
we estimate that these amounts represent approximately of our fuel needs for amount reflects the total purchase price or lease commitment of tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout net of estimated trade in values and other dispositions  the estimated amount due under these commitments is approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be financed by debt  proceeds from sales of existing equipment  cash flows from operations  and operating leases 
we have the option to cancel commitments relating to tractor equipment with days notice 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we financed approximately  tractors and  trailers under operating leases 
vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
our revenue equipment rental and other related amounts were million in  compared to million in the total amount of remaining payments under operating leases as of december   was million 
in connection with various operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
as of december   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we believe that the proceeds from the sale of equipment under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation on substantially all operating leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
depreciation of revenue equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and was approximately million on tractors and trailers in depreciation of revenue equipment is our largest item of depreciation 
we generally depreciate new tractors excluding day cabs over five years to salvage values of to and new trailers over seven years to salvage values of to 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 
we annually review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised value of the asset  as appropriate 
we have not recognized any impairments of long lived assets to date 
insurance and other claims the primary claims arising against us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
our insurance program involves self insurance with high risk retention levels 
because of our significant self insured retention amounts  we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and to variations between our estimates and actual ultimate payouts 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 

table of contents in addition to estimates within our self insured retention layers  we also must make judgments concerning our aggregate coverage limits 
if any claim occurrence were to exceed our aggregate coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our then effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
during we engaged an independent  third party actuarial firm to assist us in evaluating our claims reserves estimates 
as a result of the actuarial study and our own procedures we recorded a million non cash  pretax increase to claims reserves during the fourth quarter of we have incorporated several procedures suggested by the actuary into our claims estimation process for future periods 
lease accounting and off balance sheet transactions operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment  computer equipment and company airplane 
in connection with the leases of a majority of the value of the equipment we finance with operating leases  we issue residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we annually review the estimated fair market value of the leased revenue equipment at the end of the lease term against the residual values we guarantee 
the estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments 
as leases are entered into determination as to the classification as an operating or capital lease involves management judgments on residual values and useful lives 
accounting for income taxes in this area  we make important judgments concerning a variety of factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on future company performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
in connection with an audit of our and tax returns  the irs proposed to disallow three of our tax strategies 
we met with internal revenue service irs appeals division during the fourth quarter of and have proposed a settlement agreement 
at this time  we have not received the executed irs response to the agreement 
in april  we submitted a million cash bond to the irs to prevent any future interest expense in the event of an unsuccessful defense of the strategies 
in addition  we have accrued amounts that we believe are appropriate given our expectations concerning the ultimate resolution of the strategies 
the irs is currently auditing our and tax returns and has proposed two disallowances totaling approximately  for the and years related to the november stock offering 
we have responded to the irs with a settlement offer 
at this time  the irs has not responded to the offer 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet and are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities tax benefits and liabilities expected to be realized in the future are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense 
on a periodic basis we assess the need for adjustment of the valuation allowance 
no valuation reserve has been established at december   because  based on forecasted income  we believe that it is more likely than not that the future benefit of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 

table of contents we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
during  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of income tax liabilities 
however  should our tax positions be challenged  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported through our consolidated statement of operations 
new accounting pronouncements effective december   we adopted fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption of fin impacted our accounting for the conditional obligation to remove company decals and other identifying markings from certain tractors and trailers under operating leases at the end of the lease terms 
upon adoption of this standard  we recorded an increase to other assets of million and accrued expenses of million  in addition to recognizing a non cash  pre tax cumulative effect charge of million million on an after tax basis  or per diluted share

sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  early application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted this statement effective january inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
new emissions control regulations and increases in commodity prices  wages of manufacturing workers  and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the cost of fuel also has risen substantially over the past three years 
we believe this increase primarily reflects world events rather than underlying inflationary pressure 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates  certain cost control efforts and the effects of fuel prices through fuel surcharges 
seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
for the reasons stated  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
our equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and because of general increases in shipping demand during those months 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by our dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 

table of contents the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting our equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during  and we believe that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality for our business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
commodity price risk from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in accordance with sfas  we adjust any derivative instruments to fair value through earnings on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
interest rate risk our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
our variable rate obligations consist of our credit agreement and our securitization facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  are based on the banks base rate  which floats daily  or libor  which accrues interest based on one  two  three  or six month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on a consolidated leverage ratio  which is generally defined as the ratio of borrowings  letters of credit  and the present value of operating lease obligations to our earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and rental payments under operating leases 
the applicable margin was at december  at december   we had variable  libor borrowings of million outstanding under the credit agreement 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two million notional amount interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of variability in cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
the swaps expire january and march due to the counter parties embedded options to cancel  these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and consequently are marked to fair value through earnings  in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of  our securitization facility carries a variable interest rate based on the commercial paper rate plus an applicable margin of per annum 
at december   borrowings of million had been drawn on the securitization facility 
assuming variable rate borrowings under the credit agreement and securitization facility at december  levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates could increase our annual interest expense by approximately
