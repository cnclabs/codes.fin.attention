item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have committed a substantial amount of capital to upgrade our wireless networks to offer g data services 
if the demand for wireless data services does not grow  or if we fail to capitalize on such demand  it could have an adverse effect on our growth 
we have committed significant resources to wireless data services and our business plan assumes increasing demand for such services 
although demand for wireless data services is growing  it is currently a small portion of our revenues 
continued growth in demand for wireless data services is dependent on development and availability of popular applications and availability of handsets and other wireless devices with features  functionality  and pricing desired by customers 
if applications and devices are not developed or do not become commercially acceptable  our revenues could be adversely affected 
even if such demand does develop  our ability to deploy and deliver wireless data services relies  in many instances  on new and unproven technology 
existing technology may not perform as expected  and we may not be able to obtain new technology to effectively and economically deliver these services 
we cannot give assurance that there will be widespread demand for advanced wireless data services  that revenues from data services will constitute a significant portion of our total revenues in the near future  or that we can provide such services on a profitable basis 

table of contents our business could be materially and adversely affected by our failure to anticipate and react to frequent and significant technological changes 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology that are evidenced by the introduction of g digital handsets and applications  evolving industry standards  the availability of new radio frequency spectrum allocations for wireless services  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements  developments in emerging wireless transmission technologies  and changes in end user requirements and preferences 
it is possible that we may select a technology that does not achieve widespread commercial success or that is not compatible with the technology selected by one or more of our roaming partners  and as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  one or more of the technologies that we currently utilize may become inferior or obsolete at some time in the future 
a significant portion of our revenue is from roaming charges 
outcollect roaming yields have been declining over the last few years and are expected to continue to decline in the future 
as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected if increases in roaming minutes do not offset anticipated decreases in roaming yield 
in   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from roaming charges incurred by other wireless providers for use of our network by their customers who traveled within our coverage areas 
a substantial portion of our roaming revenue is derived from cingular  verizon wireless  and t mobile 
changes in their operations or a significant decline in the number of their customers could adversely affect our business 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with at t wireless awe  verizon wireless  and t mobile accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total outcollect roaming minutes 
for the years ended december    and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe accounted for approximately   and  of our total revenue 
changes in the network footprints of these providers could have a material adverse effect on our outcollect revenue and incollect expenses 
for example  if a roaming partner from which we derive a significant amount of revenue in one of our service areas were to build its own network in that service area  our outcollect revenue derived from our roaming relationship with that partner in that service area might decrease or even cease altogether  and our ability to negotiate favorable incollect rates in that partner s other service areas could suffer as well 
any overbuild of our service areas by our roaming partners would also result in increased competition  which could have a negative impact on our outcollect roaming revenues  business  operating results  and retention 
our roaming agreements have varying terms  from month to month to up to five years  and some are terminable with days written notice 
when these agreements expire or are terminated  we may be unable to renegotiate these roaming agreements or to obtain roaming agreements with other wireless providers upon acceptable terms 
failure to obtain acceptable roaming agreements could lead to a substantial decline in our revenue and operating income 

table of contents our roaming revenue is subject to some effects of seasonality  and as a result  our overall revenue and operating income are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in   and  a substantial amount of our revenue was derived from roaming charges incurred by other wireless providers for use of our network by their customers who traveled within our service areas 
our service areas include a number of resort destinations 
as a result  our roaming revenue increases during vacation periods  introducing a measure of seasonality to our revenue and operating income 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters seasonality 
we operate in a very competitive business environment  which can adversely affect our business and operations 
competitors who offer more services than we do may attract our targeted customers 
we operate in highly competitive markets  and there is substantial and increasing competition in all aspects of the wireless communications business 
some competitors may market services we do not offer  such as cable television  internet access  landline local exchange  or long distance services  which may make their services more attractive to customers 
competition for customers is based primarily upon services and features offered  system coverage  technical quality of wireless systems  price  customer service  capacity  and strength of distribution channels 
in each of our markets we compete with several other wireless licensees 
to a lesser extent  we also compete with wireless internet  paging  dispatch services  resellers  and landline telephone service providers in some of our service areas 
increasingly  cellular services have become a viable alternative to landline voice services for certain customers  putting cellular licensees in direct competition with traditional landline telephone service providers 
cable and other companies are providing telecommunications services to the home  and of these  some carriers are providing local and long distance voice services using voice over internet protocol  or voip 
in particular circumstances  these carriers may be able to avoid payment of access charges to local exchange carriers for the use of their networks on long distance calls 
cost savings for these carriers could result in lower rates for customers and increased competition for wireless services 
continuing industry consolidation has resulted in the increased presence of regional and national wireless operators within some of our service areas 
many of these national operators provide services comparable to ours and  because they operate in a wider geographic area  are able to offer no or low cost roaming and toll calls over a wider area 
in addition  some national wireless operators have recently begun to build networks in certain of the more densely populated or well traveled portions of our service areas 
national advertising and promotional programs by national wireless operators run in our markets are also a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures  even though these operators may not provide service in those markets 
if the wireless communications industry continues to consolidate and we do not participate in that consolidation  even stronger competitors may be created 
the fcc has eliminated the spectrum cap and the cellular cross interest restriction in all markets 
these regulatory actions may facilitate the creation of larger and more formidable competitors 
several of our competitors also operate in multiple segments of the industry 
in the future  we expect to face increased competition from entities providing similar services using other communications technologies 
given the rapid advances in the wireless communications industry  it is possible that new technologies will evolve that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  sales  and distribution resources 
with so many companies targeting many of the same customers  we may not be able to successfully attract and retain customers and grow our customer base and revenues  which could have a materially adverse effect on our future business  strategy  operations  and financial condition 

table of contents market prices for wireless service may decline in the future 
we expect significant price competition among wireless providers that may lead to increasing movement of customers between operators  resulting in reductions in average monthly service revenue per customer 
while we will try to maintain or grow our customer base and average monthly service revenue per customer  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
a significant decline in the pricing of services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
wireless number portability may continue to have a negative impact on our customer retention and increase our marketing costs 
wireless number portability allows customers to keep their wireless phone number when switching to a different service provider 
wireless number portability has increased and may continue to increase competition and reduce retention 
since implementation of wireless number portability in our markets  we have experienced increased churn 
a high rate of churn would adversely affect our results of operations by reducing revenue and increasing the cost of adding new customers 
such costs generally include commission expense and or significant handset discounts  which are significant factors in income and profitability 
we may be required to grant promotional credits  subsidize product upgrades  and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives and to retain customers  which could adversely impact our operating results 
if we encounter significant problems  such as delays  inaccuracies  or loss of customer information from our database  in the process of upgrading our billing function  we could experience customer dissatisfaction and increased churn  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
during the second half of  we transferred our northeast  northwest and south territory gsm customers to the verisign data processing and billing system 
this process has caused disruption in our billing cycles  including delays in mailing of and errors in statements sent to customers  and customers may be dropped from our database 
in addition  the transition has caused additional customer service calls to be made to our call center 
if such problems are significant or prolonged  our customers may become dissatisfied and decide to switch to a rival carrier 
also  we are dependent on future performance of an outside contractor 
any significant or prolonged problems with our billing function could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regulation or potential litigation relating to the use of wireless phones while driving could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if wireless handsets are perceived to pose health and safety risks  we may be subject to new regulations  and demand for our services may decrease 
some studies have indicated that using wireless phones while driving may distract drivers attention  making accidents more likely 
these concerns could lead to litigation relating to accidents  deaths  or serious bodily injuries  or to new restrictions or regulations on wireless phone use  any of which also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations 
a number of us states and local governments are considering or have recently enacted legislation that would restrict or prohibit the use of a wireless handset while driving or  alternatively  require the use of a hands free telephone 
legislation of this sort  if enacted  would require wireless service providers to provide hands free enhanced services  such as voice activated dialing and hands free speaker phones and headsets 
if we are unable to provide hands free services and products to customers in a timely and adequate fashion  our ability to generate revenues could suffer 
it has been suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
concerns over the effect of radio frequency emissions may discourage the use of wireless handsets  which would decrease demand for our services 

table of contents our business is subject to extensive government regulation  which could adversely affect our business by increasing our expenses 
we also may be unable to obtain or retain regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
the fcc regulates many aspects of our business  including the licensing  construction  interconnection  operation  acquisition  and sale of our wireless systems  as well as the number of wireless licenses issued in each of our markets 
state and local regulatory authorities  to a lesser extent  also regulate aspects of our business and services 
in addition  the federal aviation administration regulates aspects of construction  marking  and lighting of communications towers on which we place our wireless transmitters 
changes in legislation and regulations governing wireless activities  wireless carriers  and availability of usf support  our failure to comply with applicable regulations  or our loss of or failure to obtain any license or licensed area could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the fcc and state authorities are increasingly looking to the wireless industry to fund various initiatives  including federal and state universal service programs  telephone number administration  services to the hearing impaired  and emergency services 
in addition  many states have imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry and have adopted or are considering adoption of regulatory requirements regarding customer billing and other matters 
these initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose increased costs on us and other wireless carriers and may otherwise adversely affect our business 
under phase ii of its emergency service rules  for example  the fcc has mandated that wireless providers supply the geographic coordinates of a customer s location  by means of network based or handset based technologies  to public safety dispatch agencies 
we have received requests from psaps for deployment of phase ii enhanced service that relate to various areas where we provide cellular or pcs service and we have met the applicable coverage benchmark 
nevertheless  if the fcc finds that the accuracy results produced by any of our phase ii deployments are not in compliance with fcc rules  the fcc could issue enforcement orders and impose monetary forfeitures upon us 
we have filed with the fcc a request for waiver of the applicable fcc rule concerning field test results in the state of vermont  which may not be compliant with fcc location accuracy requirements if averaged only with results from the state of vermont 
to the extent that we are not meeting the fcc s e phase ii location accuracy requirements in vermont and other states we may need to file one or more additional petitions with the fcc to request a waiver of those requirements 
the fcc has issued notices of apparent liability requiring other cmrs providers to pay fines based upon violations of enhanced service requirements 
the implementation of enhanced obligations may have a financial impact on us 
we are not yet able to predict the extent of that impact 
each of our wireless licenses is subject to renewal upon expiration of its current term  which is generally ten years 
grants of wireless license renewals are governed by fcc rules establishing a presumption in favor of incumbent licensees that have complied with their regulatory obligations during the ten year license period 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the fcc will grant us any future renewal applications or that our applications will be free from challenge 
in addition  fcc rules require wireless licensees to meet build out requirements with respect to particular licenses  and failure to comply with these and other requirements in a given licensed area could result in revocation or nonrenewal of our license for that area or the imposition of fines by the fcc 

table of contents our designation or certification as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc in any state where we conduct business could be refused  conditioned  or revoked due to circumstances beyond our control  thus depriving us of financial support in that state from the universal service fund usf 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to receive payments at the current levels 
in order to receive financial support from the usf in any state  we must receive etc certification in that state 
currently  we are etc certified in ten of the states in which we offer wireless services 
if designation or certification in any of these states were revoked or conditioned  our financial results could be adversely affected 
further  there are several fcc proceedings underway that are likely to change the way universal service programs are funded and the ways these funds are disbursed to program recipients 
at this time  it is not clear what impact changes in the rules  if any  will have on our continued eligibility to receive usf support 
loss of usf revenues could adversely affect our future financial performance 
if we are unable to comply with obligations imposed by the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea  our financial results could be adversely affected 
the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea requires us to make services accessible to law enforcement for surveillance purposes 
additional requirements have been adopted to require cellular and pcs licensees to accommodate interception of digital packet mode telecommunications 
we will become obligated to comply with these requirements only if and when we commence to offer services that make use of digital packet mode technology 
if we are not able to comply with calea prior to the applicable deadlines  we could be subject to substantial fines 
we cannot predict yet whether we will be able to comply with calea requirements prior to the applicable deadlines 
equipment failure and natural disasters may adversely affect our operations 
a major equipment failure or a natural disaster affecting any of our central switching offices  microwave links  or cell sites could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our inability to operate any portion of our wireless system for an extended time period could result in a loss of customers or impair our ability to attract new customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
difficulties in the continued upgrade of our wireless systems could increase our planned capital expenditures  delay the continued build out of our networks  and negatively impact our roaming arrangements 
whenever we upgrade our networks  we need to select appropriate equipment vendors  select and acquire appropriate sites for our transmission equipment  or cell sites  purchase and install low power transmitters  receivers  and control equipment  or base radio equipment  build out any required physical infrastructure  obtain interconnection services from local telephone service carriers  and test cell sites 

table of contents our ability to perform these necessary steps successfully may be hindered by  among other things  any failure to obtain necessary zoning and other regulatory approvals  lease or obtain rights to sites for the location of our base radio equipment  obtain any necessary capital  acquire any additional necessary spectrum from third parties  and commence and complete the construction of sites for our equipment in a timely and satisfactory manner 
in addition  we may experience cost overruns and delays not within our control caused by acts of governmental entities  design changes  material and equipment shortages  delays in delivery  and catastrophic occurrences 
any failure to upgrade our wireless systems on a timely basis may affect our ability to provide the quality of service in our markets consistent with our current business plan  and any significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to meet upgrade milestones or to comply with other requirements under our roaming agreements could have an adverse effect on our roaming revenue 
our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

as a result  we are required to test both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of our spectrum licenses  for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing them over time 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
additionally  the value of our licenses must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value might be impaired 
the amount of any such annual or interim impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

as a result  we are required to assess the impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates impairment of long lived assets 
any operating losses resulting from impairment charges under sfas no 
or sfas no 
could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired or exchanged properties  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we seek to improve our networks and service areas through selective acquisitions of other providers properties and other assets  and in some instances  we may exchange our properties or assets for the properties and assets of another carrier 
we will be required to integrate with our operations any properties we acquire  which may have billing systems  customer care systems  and other operational characteristics that differ significantly from those of our networks 
we may be unsuccessful in those efforts  and customer retention in acquired properties and surrounding areas may suffer as a result  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company subject to the sarbanes oxley act of soa  as well as new rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq stock market 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses 
in addition  the soa  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
we expect these new rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make certain activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees  or as executive officers 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
we may in the future discover material weaknesses in our internal controls as defined under interim standards adopted by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob and significant deficiencies and deficiencies in certain of our disclosure controls and procedures 
under the pcaob standards  a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
a significant deficiency is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affect a company s ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected 
while we have taken steps to improve our internal and disclosure controls  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could harm operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  which could affect our ability to remain listed with the nasdaq national market 
ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
litigation instituted against us and our officers and directors as a result of changes in the price of our securities could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating results  our ability to finance our operations and meet obligations under our financing arrangements conditions or trends in the wireless communications industry and changes in the economic performance and or market valuation of other wireless communications companies  our strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our securities  regardless of our actual operating performance 
often a drop in a company s stock price is followed by lawsuits against the company and its officers and directors alleging securities fraud 
the defense and eventual settlement of or judgment rendered in any such actions could result in substantial costs 
also  the defense of any such actions could divert management s attention and resources 
both the costs and the diversion of management could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  any material adverse judgment could trigger an event of default under our indebtedness 
we have a significant amount of debt and preferred stock  which may limit our ability to meet our debt service and dividend obligations  obtain future financing  make capital expenditures in support of our business plan  react to a downturn in our business  or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
as of december   we had approximately billion of long term liabilities which includes million of senior and junior exchangeable preferred stock  and approximately million of class m preferred stock  and shareholders deficit of approximately million 
of the outstanding preferred stock  million can be exchanged  at our option  subject to compliance with certain leverage ratios under our credit facility and the indentures related to our outstanding notes  for senior subordinated indebtedness 

table of contents the current levels of our debt and preferred stock entail a number of risks  including the following we must use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds that would otherwise be available to us for working capital  capital expenditures  future business opportunities  and other purposes  we may not be able to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  and other purposes on terms favorable to us or at all  borrowings under our floating rate notes and our revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates  making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we may have more debt than many of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  we may have limited flexibility to react to changes in our business  and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or preferred stock on terms that are commercially reasonable or at all 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the principal or liquidation preference of  and interest or preferred dividends on  our indebtedness and preferred stock is not certain 
in particular  if we do not meet our anticipated revenue growth and operating expense targets  our future debt and preferred stock service obligations could exceed the amount of our available cash 
the restrictive covenants in our existing debt and preferred stock instruments and agreements may limit our ability to operate our business 
the instruments governing our debt and the certificates of designation governing our preferred stock impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit  among other things  our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  pay cash dividends on capital stock  repay junior debt and preferred stock prior to stated maturities  allow the imposition of dividend restrictions on certain subsidiaries  sell assets  make investments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  and engage in some types of mergers or acquisitions 
our failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to a default under the terms of the relevant debt or a violation of the terms of the preferred stock even if we are able to meet debt service and dividend obligations 
our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios if we draw against it 
substantially all our assets are subject to liens securing indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and senior secured notes 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a downturn in our business  or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
if there were an event of default under our revolving credit facility or other debt  the holders of the affected debt could elect to declare all of that debt to be due and payable  which  in turn  could cause all of our other debt to become due and payable 
we might not have sufficient funds available  and we might be unable to obtain sufficient funds from alternative sources on terms favorable to us or at all 
if the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility were accelerated and we could not obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations  our lenders could proceed against our assets and the stock and assets of our subsidiaries that guarantee our revolving credit facility and senior secured notes 

table of contents our failure to pay the cash dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock may affect our ability to incur additional debt or refinance our existing indebtedness 
we are required to pay dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock 
beginning in august  we did not declare or pay cash dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock 
because  as of november   we had failed to pay six or more quarterly dividends  a voting rights triggering event  as defined in the certificate of designation for the senior exchangeable preferred stock  existed 
while a voting rights triggering event exists certain terms of our senior exchangeable preferred stock  if enforceable  may prohibit incurrence of additional indebtedness  including borrowing under our revolving credit facility and the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
on october   we paid four quarterly dividends on our outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock 
these quarterly dividends totaled per share  including accrued interest 
the aggregate total dividends of approximately million were paid from existing cash 
the payment of these dividends reduced the number of unpaid quarterly dividends to five and eliminated the then existing voting rights triggering event and any uncertainty regarding our ability to incur indebtedness  including under the revolving credit facility  allowing us to draw million under the revolving credit facility and issue million in new senior subordinated floating rate notes 
subsequent to the issuance of the new notes and borrowing under our credit facility  we elected not to pay cash dividends in november or february on our senior exchangeable preferred stock and a voting rights triggering event again exists 
management does not anticipate paying additional dividends in the foreseeable future 
our failure to pay the cash dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock may result in changes in our board of directors and affect our ability to incur additional debt 
since may  we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock 
if we do not pay any of the future dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock  a voting rights triggering event  as defined in the certificate of designation for the junior exchangeable preferred stock  will occur in august at that time  the holders of the junior exchangeable preferred stock will be entitled to elect the lesser of two directors or the number of directors equal to of our board of directors 
in addition  should a voting rights triggering event exist under the junior exchangeable preferred stock  our ability to incur indebtedness may be impaired 
we have shareholders who could exercise significant influence on management 
the holders of our class m convertible preferred stock currently are able to elect two members to our board of directors and can vote  on an as converted basis  approximately  shares of our class a common stock  which represented  as of december   approximately of the voting power of our common stock 
our board of directors also includes two directors elected by our senior exchangeable preferred stockholders 
if any of these holders were to disagree with decisions made by management or the board of directors about our plans or operations  they might be able to bring significant pressure to change such plans or operations 
the holders of our junior exchangeable preferred stock  under certain circumstances  may also be able to elect members of our board of directors in the future 
antitakeover provisions could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
some of the provisions of our articles of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws  and minnesota law could delay or prevent a change of control or a change in management that may be beneficial to shareholders 
these provisions include provisions for a classified board of directors  provisions for advance notice for director nominations and shareholder proposals  provisions allowing holders of our class b common stock ten votes per share as compared to one vote per share for our class a common stock  provisions for supermajority votes to approve mergers or amend specified provisions of the articles and bylaws  and statutory limits regarding share acquisitions and business combinations 
we also have adopted a rights plan that could discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring us at a premium price 
the rights plan provides that preferred stock purchase rights attached to each share of our common stock become exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at of market value  causing substantial dilution to a person or group acquiring or more of our common stock if the acquisition is not approved by our board of directors 

table of contents in addition  the documents governing our indebtedness contain limitations on our ability to enter into a change of control transaction 
under these documents  the occurrence of a change of control transaction  in some cases after notice and grace periods  would constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of the indebtedness

we own all the equipment within the leased sites 
the leases covering these sites have various expiration dates and are with numerous lessors 
these leases generally have renewal options that we would anticipate exercising 
due to our network design  loss of a leased location would not have a material impact on the operations of a territory s business 
we have retail locations  of which almost all are leased 
the leases covering these locations have various expiration dates 
we believe that the loss of any one of these retail sites would not have a material impact on our business as we would likely be able to obtain substantially equivalent alternative space 

table of contents item legal proceedings we are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we believe that the resolution of such routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account established reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

dividend policy rcc has never paid dividends on its common stock 
the terms of our credit facility  outstanding notes  and exchangeable preferred stock limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
our ability to pay cash dividends on and to redeem for cash our senior exchangeable preferred stock and junior exchangeable preferred stock when required is restricted under various covenants contained in documents governing our outstanding preferred stock and our indebtedness  including the notes 
in addition  under minnesota law  we are permitted to pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  including the senior exchangeable preferred stock and the junior exchangeable preferred stock  only if our board of directors determines that we will be able to pay our debts in the ordinary course of business after paying the dividends or completing the redemption 
in addition  in order to redeem the junior exchangeable preferred stock  our board of directors must determine that we have sufficient assets to satisfy the liquidation preferences of the senior exchangeable preferred stock 
as of december   we would have been able to make a total of million in restricted payments 
on october   we paid four quarterly dividends on our outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock 
these quarterly dividends totaled per share  including accrued interest 
the aggregate total dividends of approximately million were paid from existing cash 
the payment of these dividends reduced the number of unpaid quarterly dividends to five and eliminated the then existing voting rights triggering event and any uncertainty regarding our ability to incur indebtedness  including under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to the issuance of the floating rate subordinated notes and borrowing under our credit facility  we elected not to pay cash dividends in november or february on our senior exchangeable preferred stock and  accordingly a voting rights triggering event currently exists 
management does not anticipate paying additional dividends in the foreseeable future 
issuance of common stock in october  rcc converted all of the outstanding shares of class t convertible preferred stock into the  shares of class a and  shares of class b common stock 
dividends are not payable if the shares are converted 
this conversion resulted in a gain of approximately million  which reduced preferred stock dividends in

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a wireless communications service provider focusing primarily on rural markets in the united states 
our principal operating objective is to increase revenue and achieve profitability through increased penetration in our existing markets 
our operating territories include portions of five states in the northeast  three states in the northwest  four states in the midwest  and three states in the south 
within each of our four territories  we have a strong local sales and customer service presence in the communities we serve 
our marketed networks covered a total population of approximately million pops and served approximately  voice customers as of december  we have national roaming agreements in our markets with cingular effective through december and verizon effective through december 
under these agreements  we are able to attain preferred roaming status by overlaying our existing tdma networks in our south  northeast and northwest networks with gsm gprs edge technology and our midwest network with cdma technology 
we also have various agreements with t mobile  which are effective through december operating revenue our revenue primarily consists of service  roaming  and equipment revenue  each of which is described below service revenue includes monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by customers  data related services  as well as wireless and paging equipment lease revenue 
also included are charges for features such as voicemail  call waiting  call forwarding  and incollect revenue  which consists of charges to our customers when they use their wireless phones in other wireless markets 
we do not charge installation or connection fees 
we also include in service revenue the usf support funding that we receive as a result of our etc status in certain states and the usf pass through fees we charge our customers 
roaming revenue includes only outcollect revenue  which we receive when other wireless providers customers use our network 
equipment revenue includes sales of wireless equipment and accessories to customers  network equipment reselling  and customer activation fees 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses include network costs  cost of equipment sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  each of which is described below network costs include switching and transport expenses and expenses associated with the maintenance and operation of our wireless network facilities  including salaries for employees involved in network operations  site costs  charges from other service providers for resold minutes  and the service and expense associated with incollect revenue 
cost of equipment sales includes costs associated with telephone equipment and accessories sold to customers 
in recent years  we and other wireless providers have increased the use of discounts on phone equipment to attract customers as competition between service providers has intensified 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales per gross additional and migrated customer 
we expect to continue these discounts and promotions because we believe they will increase the number of our wireless customers and  consequently  increase service revenue 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include salaries  benefits  and operating expenses such as marketing  commissions  customer support  accounting  administration  and billing 
we also include in sg a contributions payable to the usf 
depreciation and amortization represents the costs associated with the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of customer lists and spectrum relocation 
other expenses in addition to the operating expenses discussed above  rcc also incurs other expenses  primarily interest on debt and dividends on preferred stock 
interest expense primarily results from the issuance of outstanding notes and exchangeable preferred stock  the proceeds of which were used to finance acquisitions  repay other borrowings  and further develop our wireless network 
interest expense includes the following o interest expense on our credit facility  senior secured notes  senior notes  and senior subordinated notes  o amortization of debt issuance costs  o early extinguishment of debt issuance costs  o dividends on senior and junior exchangeable preferred stock  o amortization of preferred stock issuance costs  o gain loss on derivative instruments  and o gains on repurchase and exchange of preferred stock 
preferred stock dividends are accrued on our outstanding class m convertible preferred stock and had been accrued on our class t convertible preferred stock  which was converted to common stock in october 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets  and liabilities during the periods reported 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as unbilled revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization periods  income taxes  valuation of intangible assets  and litigation contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the requirements of sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of october st or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future cash flows from the reporting units 
these projections are based on our view of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions  the appropriate discount rates relative to risk  and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates  or estimates of residual values were to occur  goodwill may become impaired 
additionally  impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of fcc licenses  are required to be performed on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the asset might be impaired 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf no 
 impairment tests for fcc licenses are performed on an aggregate basis for each unit of accounting 
we utilize a fair value approach  incorporating discounted cash flows  to complete the test 
this approach determines the fair value of the fcc licenses  using start up model assumptions and  accordingly  incorporates cash flow assumptions regarding the investment in a network  the development of distribution channels  and other inputs for making the business operational 
these inputs are included in determining free cash flows of each unit of accounting  using assumptions of weighted average costs of capital and the long term rate of growth for each unit of accounting 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if any of the assumptions were to change  our fcc licenses may become impaired 
under sfas no 
 we performed annual impairment tests in   and for our indefinite lived assets 
based on these tests  we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million included in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of there was no impairment charge in and related to our annual assessment under sfas no 

table of contents revenue recognition service we recognize service revenue based upon contracted service fees and minutes of use processed 
as a result of our billing cycle cut off times  we are required to make estimates for service revenue earned  but not yet billed  at the end of each month 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes of use processed 
we follow this method since reasonable  dependable estimates of the revenue can be made 
actual billing cycle results and related revenue may vary from the results estimated at the end of each quarter  depending on customer usage and rate plan mix 
for customers who prepay their monthly access fees  we match the recognition of service revenue to their corresponding usage 
revenues are net of credits and adjustments for service 
we receive usf revenue reflecting our etc status in certain states 
we recognize support revenue depending on the level of our collection experience in each etc qualified state 
where we do not have adequate experience to determine the time required for reimbursement  we recognize revenue upon cash receipt 
where we do have adequate experience as to the amount and timing of the receipt of these funds  we recognize revenue on an accrual basis 
we include the pass through fees we collect from customers as service revenue with a corresponding charge to sg a expense 
these pass through fees  which we have the option of passing to our customers  include state and federal usf fees  together with city utility and state gross receipt taxes 
revenue recognition roaming revenue and incollect cost roaming revenue and incollect cost information is provided to us primarily through a third party centralized clearinghouse 
from the clearinghouse we receive monthly settlement data 
we base our accrual of roaming revenue and incollect expense on these clearinghouse reports 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of roaming revenue and incollect cost can be made based on these reports 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from failure of our customers to pay amounts owed 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may be required to maintain higher allowances 
depreciation of property and equipment we depreciate our wireless communications equipment using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
we periodically review changes in our technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity  and salvage to determine adjustments to estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
total depreciation expense for the years ended december    and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the lives of our tdma assets and reduced the remaining useful life of this equipment from approximately months to months 
accordingly  all tdma equipment will be fully depreciated by december  the net book value of this equipment as of december   was approximately million 

table of contents while we will continue to provide service to existing tdma customers for the foreseeable future  the amount of future cash flows to be derived from the tdma network assets is highly dependent upon the rate of transition of existing customers using tdma equipment to g capable equipment as well as other competitive and technological factors 
we determined that a reduction in the useful lives of these assets was warranted based on the projected transition of network traffic 
we will continue to review the useful lives of the tdma assets throughout the period of transition to g capable equipment to determine whether further changes are warranted 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
in analyzing potential impairment  we use projections of future undiscounted cash flows from the assets 
these projections are based on our view of growth rates for the related business  anticipated future economic conditions  the appropriate discount rates relative to risk  and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates  or estimates of residual values were to occur  long lived assets may become impaired 
on june   our customer relationship management and billing managed services agreement with amdocs was mutually terminated 
as a result of the termination of the agreement  we recorded a charge to operations during the quarter ended june  of million  reflecting the write down of certain development costs previously capitalized 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish an appropriate valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist principally of certain net operating losses nols being carried forward  as well as impairment write downs of intangible assets not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical operations projected forward and our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
it is possible that we could be profitable in the future at levels that cause us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion or all of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would be approximately under current tax law 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would likely remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is utilized or the nols expire unused 

table of contents litigation and other loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to litigation and other contingencies 
management must use its best judgment and estimates of probable outcomes when determining the impact of these contingencies 
we assess the impact of claims and litigation on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting for share based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
commencing with the quarter ending march   we will adopt sfas no 
r  utilizing the modified prospective method for all share based awards granted on or after january  under the modified prospective method sfas no 
r requires compensation cost to be recognized for all share based compensation expense arrangements granted after the adoption date and all remaining unvested share based compensation arrangements granted prior to the adoption date 
prior periods will not be restated 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option grants 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
through december   we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations to account for our employee and director stock options and did not record compensation expense for share based payment award transactions since the exercise price had been the fair value of rcc s common stock at the grant date 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenue operating revenue years ended december  in thousands increase increase service roaming equipment total operating revenue service revenue 
service revenue growth for the year ended december  primarily reflects lsr increasing to compared to for the year ended december   partially offset by declining customers 
the lsr increase in was due to an increase of in usf payments and in access  data and features

service revenue years ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease local service usf support regulatory pass through other total service revenue the decline in local service revenue for the year ended december  reflects the decrease in customers as we have transitioned our tdma networks to g technology 
customers 
primarily reflecting customer retention declining to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   our total customers decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december  our decline in customer retention reflects a multitude of technology related issues  including increased customer care needs which we encountered during the commercial introduction of our gsm networks in the second quarter of  gsm billing system changes  the transitional stage of our networks  and increased national carrier competition 
postpaid customer gross adds for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  as of december   approximately of our postpaid customers were using new technology handsets as compared to at december  we believe our new technology customers provide higher retention rates and lsr and therefore plan to aggressively migrate our legacy customer base to new technology products throughout we anticipate positive net postpaid customer growth in 
table of contents roaming revenue 
the increase in roaming revenue during the year ended december  primarily reflects a increase in outcollect minutes partially offset by a decline in roaming yield 
our outcollect yield for the year ended december  was 
per minute as compared to 
per minute in the year ended december  declines in tdma outcollect minutes were offset by increases in new technology gsm and cdma outcollect minutes 
negatively impacting roaming revenue primarily during and the first and second quarters of was the transition by our national roaming partners to g technology handsets 
because these partners converted their customer base to this new technology before we had fully operational g networks  we did not capture a portion of available roaming revenue 
at december   substantially all of our  cell sites were equipped with g technology 
for the years ended december  and  g outcollect minutes accounted for and  respectively  of our total outcollect minutes

for the years ended december  and  cingular on a pro forma basis giving effect to its merger with awe accounted for approximately and of our total revenue 
roaming revenue has also been affected by the transfer of our oregon rsa service area to awe on march  we anticipate roaming minute increases to offset anticipated roaming yield declines  which together with the full year operation of our new technology networks  should result in roaming revenue exceeding levels 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  contributing to equipment revenue in was the increase in customer migrations to  as compared to  during the year ended december  also contributing to equipment revenue for the year ended december  was an increase of gross postpaid customers

as a percentage of revenue  sg a increased to in the year ended december  as compared to during the year ended december  primarily contributing to the increase in g a were increased contract labor and services related to our roll out of new technology products and billing system conversion costs 
sales and marketing costs increased due to the market launch of g technology products 
we also incurred higher bad debt expense during the year  partially reflecting billing system difficulties and the resulting decline in customer retention 
regulatory pass through fees increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december   reflecting a change in federally managed rates 
given the stabilization of our billing platforms and the substantial completion of our g technology overlay  we expect sg a in to be comparable to components of sg a are as follows years ended december  in thousands increase increase general and administrative sales and marketing bad debt regulatory pass through fees stock based compensation sg a

r  stock based compensation in future financial statements will include cost to be recognized for all stock based compensation expense arrangements  including employee and non employee stock options granted after january  and all remaining unvested stock based compensation arrangements granted prior to january   commencing with the quarter ending march  accordingly  we expect stock based compensation to increase in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased during the year ended december  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects the accelerated depreciation of our legacy tdma networks and depreciation on the recently activated g networks in our northeast  northwest  and south territories 
at december   substantially all of our  cell sites were equipped with g technology 
for these reasons  we anticipate increased levels of depreciation and amortization in over levels

reflecting the termination of the agreement  we recorded a charge to operations during the quarter ended june  of million  reflecting the write down of certain development costs previously capitalized 
other income expense interest expense 
increased interest expense for the year ended december  reflects the company s higher debt level resulting from the november issuance of million floating rate senior subordinated notes and the borrowing of million under the revolving credit facility 
partially offsetting the impact of increased debt were gains resulting from repurchases of senior exchangeable preferred stock and gains from exchanges of senior exchangeable preferred stock for common stock

liquidity and capital resources we need cash primarily for working capital  capital expenditures primarily related to our network construction efforts  debt service  customer growth  and purchases of additional spectrum 
in past years  we have met these requirements though cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  sales of common and preferred stock  and issuance of debt 
our cell site count has increased from approximately tdma sites in early to  new technology sites at the end of  resulting in expansion of our network capability and coverage in all of our territories 
our g equipment purchases and installation commitments to our equipment vendors and roaming partners are largely met 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  we believe our network overlay and expansion efforts will improve our ability to attract customers in addition to providing customers of our roaming partners greater access to our networks 
although we do not anticipate adding as many cell sites in as we did in  we plan to add capacity within our networks  allowing them to carry increased roaming traffic and to accommodate the new technology customer migration 
we anticipate our total expenditures for will be in the million range 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily from cash on hand and operating cash flow 

table of contents senior and junior exchangeable preferred stock 
until august  we paid the dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock by issuing additional shares of exchangeable preferred stock and until february   we paid the dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock by issuing additional shares of junior preferred stock 
because we had failed to pay six or more quarterly dividends on our senior exchangeable preferred stock  a voting rights triggering event  as defined in the terms of our senior preferred stock  existed as of november  accordingly  the holders of senior exchangeable preferred stock exercised their right to elect two directors 
additionally  while a voting rights triggering event exists  certain terms of our senior preferred stock  if enforceable  may prohibit incurrence of additional indebtedness  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on october   we paid four quarterly dividends on our outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock 
these quarterly dividends totaled per share  including accrued interest 
the aggregate total dividends of approximately million were paid from existing cash 
the payment of these dividends reduced the number of unpaid quarterly dividends to five and eliminated the then existing voting rights triggering event and any uncertainty regarding our ability to incur indebtedness  including under the revolving credit facility  allowing us to draw million under the revolving credit facility and issue million in new senior subordinated floating rate notes 
subsequent to the issuance of the new notes and borrowing under our credit facility  we elected not to pay cash dividends in november or february on our senior exchangeable preferred stock and a voting rights triggering event again exists 
management does not anticipate paying additional dividends in the foreseeable future 
beginning in may our junior exchangeable preferred stock dividends are to be paid in cash 
we did not declare or pay the quarterly dividends payable in may  august  november  or february on the junior exchangeable preferred stock 
if we elect not to pay the required cash dividends on our junior exchangeable preferred stock for six or more quarters  the holders will have right to elect directors and our ability to incur debt may be limited 
total accrued dividends in arrears for both the junior and senior exchangeable preferred securities  through december   were approximately million 
senior subordinated floating rate notes 
on november   the company completed an offering of million of senior subordinated floating rate notes due  which were sold at an original issue discount of million  or 
the effective interest rate at december  was 
with the proceeds of this offering  we redeemed all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the total amount for such repurchase was approximately million  including million aggregate principal  million accrued interest to the repurchase date of december   and a million premium for early repurchase 
credit facility 
the credit facility is subject to various covenants  including the ratio of senior secured indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow as defined in the credit facility  the ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow  and the ratio of annualized operating cash flow to interest expense 
effective october   we received approval from a majority of the banks who are lenders under the revolving credit facility to exclude million of senior exchangeable preferred dividends paid on october   from the interest coverage covenant calculation 
as of december   we had borrowed million against the revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  our borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates based on  at our option  either i the one  two  three  six  or  if made available by the lender  nine or twelve month eurodollar rate  which is determined by reference to the adjusted libor rate  or ii the alternate base rate  which is the higher of the prime lending rate on page of the telerate service and the federal funds effective rate plus of percent 
in each case  we are required to pay an additional margin of interest above the eurodollar rate or the alternate base rate 
the margin is based on the ratio of our senior secured debt to our adjusted cash flow 
the margin above the alternate base rate ranges from to 
the margin above the eurodollar rate fluctuates from to

cash interest payments during the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the year ended december  we expect to fund our anticipated cash requirements primarily from cash on hand and operating cash flow and anticipate that we will be in compliance with our revolving credit facility covenants in cash flows for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  december  december  change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents  at end of year net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  adjustments to the million net loss to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities include million in depreciation and amortization  a million impairment of assets  and a million increase in accrued preferred stock dividends
