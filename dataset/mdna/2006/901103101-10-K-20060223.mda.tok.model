item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business we design  develop  and sell digital video processing systems that enable telephony based service providers to deliver broadcast quality digital video signals across their networks 
we refer to these systems as digital tv headends or video content processing systems 
we also offer digital video processing systems that enable private enterprise and government entities to transport video signals across satellite  fiber  radio  or copper facilities for surveillance  distance learning  and tv production applications 
we also offer broadband transport and service management products that enable the provisioning of high speed internet access and other broadband data services over existing copper networks within hotels and private campus facilities 
our history historically  we derived most of our sales from our broadband transport and service management products 
in november  we acquired videotele 
com  referred to in this report as vtc  from tektronix  inc to extend our product offerings to include digital video processing systems 
on june   we acquired copper mountain networks  inc  referred to in this report as copper mountain  for its technology and engineering resources which we have refocused to further address our expanding video market opportunities for delivering advanced video services over coax and fiber networks 
we earn revenue primarily by selling video content processing systems both directly and through resellers to telecommunications service providers 
we also earn revenue by selling video transmission systems to tv broadcasters and governments  and by selling broadband transport and service management products directly and through distributors to the hospitality industry and to owners of private multi tenant campus facilities 
during the years ended december   and  international sales represented  and of our total sales  respectively 
material trends and uncertainties we pay close attention to and monitor various trends and uncertainties about our business 
there is a growing demand by independent operating telephone companies to offer video services to their customer base 
according to a recent release from infonetics research in november  the number of iptv subscribers worldwide is expected to grow to over million by the end of while this growing market presents opportunities to serve a larger customer base  we are also encountering increasing competition as more companies compete to sell digital tv headend products 
we expect this market space will continue to become more competitive in the future 
our immediate competitors in the digital tv headend markets have been primarily small private companies that were focused on a narrower product line than ours and thereby may have been able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing  marketing and selling new products than we are able to 
certain of these companies have become targets for acquisition by larger companies  in which case we may face competitors with substantially greater name recognition  and technical  financial and marketing resources than we have 
this increased competitive pressure may adversely affect the amount and timing of our revenue in future periods  thereby making it more difficult for us to accurately forecast our future revenue  and may also adversely affect our product margins 
the emergence of new technologies to serve the digital tv headend market means that we must continue to invest in these technologies to remain competitive 
digital subscriber line  or dsl  technologies use sophisticated signal blending techniques to transmit data through copper wires 
the limitations on the amount of 
table of contents data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time such limitations are referred to as bandwidth and the distance data may be transmitted using copper wire constrain both the number of video channels that may be delivered simultaneously and the number of customers that are reachable from a telco central office over a dsl network 
advancements in video compression technology are now enabling high quality video streams to be transported at lower data transfer rates than has been previously available 
these compression advancements also allow for the delivery of high definition television over bandwidth constrained asymmetric dsl  or adsl  lines for the first time 
adsl is a technology that allows more data to be transmitted over existing copper telephone lines compared with standard dsl 
additionally  dsl advancements are emerging that expand the available bandwidth from the telco to the subscriber thereby supporting higher dsl data transfer rates over longer distances 
as our products continue to incorporate new technological advancements  we expect the demand for our products will increase because our products will enable more telcos to reach more of their customers with a greater number of video channels and features over their dsl networks 
however  because of the increasing competition in the markets in which we compete  regardless of our revenue and product margins in future periods  we will continue to devote significant resources to research and development in future periods in order to enable us to offer our customers competitive products that incorporate these emerging technologies 
as a consequence  we expect our research and development expenses in to be comparable to the research and development expenditures we incurred in as we continue to capitalize on the growing number of telcos deploying video services in the united states and abroad  we will continue to aggressively market our new and existing products and expand our marketing and sales efforts domestically and internationally 
nevertheless  our sales activities have been and will continue to be subject to competitive market pressure 
we believe that in certain competitive markets  our prospective customer purchase decisions continue to be impacted by lengthening of the purchase decision because of several factors that are affecting the overall digital tv headend market 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the delays in the introduction of advanced compression technology set top boxes  the transition to more efficient data transmission technologies and the emergence of video signal encryption requirements 
nevertheless  given the opportunities offered by the growing number of our target customers deploying or enhancing video services and despite the length of the sales cycle  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in compared to our spending in internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures evaluation of fiscal year our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures  as of december  based on this evaluation  they concluded as of december  that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 
definitions for discussion of results of operations our discussion of our results of operations focuses on the following items from our income statement total revenues consists of product sales  and license and royalty fees 
revenue consists of sales of our video processing systems  which includes both digital tv headend and video transmission systems 
revenue also consists of revenue from our broadband transport and service management products 
since our acquisition of vtc  a large part of our revenue has been associated with the sale of digital tv headends 
furthermore  each individual headend sale has represented a significant portion of our revenue 
if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales  our revenue would be materially impacted 
as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during  or  we expect minimal future license and royalty revenue 
cost of goods sold  or cogs  consists of costs related to raw materials  contract manufacturing  personnel  overhead  test and quality assurance for products  and the cost of licensed technology included in our 
table of contents products 
raw materials  contract manufacturing and licensed technology are the principal elements of cogs and vary directly with product sales 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of selling and marketing personnel costs  including sales commissions  facilities  travel  trade shows  promotions and outside services 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and facilities costs  contract consultants  outside testing services  and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for administrative officers and support personnel  facilities  professional services and insurance expenses 
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of expenses associated with the amortization of technology and patents related to acquisitions 
results of operations years ended december   and our acquisition of copper mountain has had a significant impact on every aspect of our financial statements since june this impact is reflected in the following discussion of our operating results 
this should be considered when evaluating our period to period comparisons of relative to years prior to the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of assets amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations gain on sale of investments interest and other income expense  net net loss total revenues 
for the year ended december   our total revenue increased by to million from million for the year ended december  we operate in a single business segment across two related markets 
we measure our revenue by our two product lines only and therefore are unable to further quantify the impact of individual products on our revenue 
during this same period  our revenue from video processing systems increased by to million from million for the year ended december  during  we experienced an increased demand for our video processing systems from independent operating telephone companies and international post  telephone and telegraph companies compared to we believe the increase in video processing systems revenue was due primarily to the increased market acceptance and the resulting increased demand for our products that address the iptv market 
in  certain prospective customers indicated to us that they were delaying their purchase decisions for a variety of factors  including their anticipation of the introduction and general availability of advanced compression technologies 
in  we introduced our upgraded astria video processing systems that 
table of contents incorporates these anticipated technologies  known as motion pictures experts group mpeg advanced video compression technologies or mpeg avc 
as a result  our upgraded astria products enable our customers to address a larger percentage of their geographic market and deliver advanced video services 
we expect our revenue from video processing systems to increase in when compared to as we continue to introduce additional features to our astria products  including high definition products to new customers and as an upgrade option to our installed base 
revenue from the sale of our broadband transport and service management products decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in broadband transport and service management revenue was primarily the result of customers choosing competing products that transmit data via wireless data transmission technologies instead of our products which transmit data over telephone wires 
the year over year decrease in our broadband transport and service management revenue is primarily due to the end of the product lifecycle for these products 
revenue from this product line is expected to increase in future quarters with the introduction of our next generation products expected late in the first quarter of legacy product sales from the june acquisition of copper mountain networks were million for the year ended december  we do not anticipate additional significant revenue from these products 
for the year ended december   our revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  during this same period  our revenue from video processing systems decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as discussed earlier  we experienced a slowing demand for our video processing systems from independent operating telephone companies during compared to we believe the decrease in video processing systems revenue was primarily due to the adverse effect of several digital tv headend sales not closing during the period as expected primarily as a result of prospective customers delaying their purchase decisions in anticipation of the introduction and general availability of advanced compression technologies 
revenue from the sale of our broadband transport and service management products decreased by to million in from million in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold increased by  or million  to million from million for the year ended december  included in cost of goods are the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
these reserves were primarily related to lower of cost or market adjustments for raw materials and reserves for finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future 
during both and  cost of goods sold included a charge for increases in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
these charges were primarily associated with our video processing systems products 
the increase in cost of goods sold of million from to included increases in materials costs of million  outside contractor expenses of million and amortization of million 
also included in cost of goods sold during was a one time charge of million to amortize the backlog acquired in the copper mountain acquisition 
our gross profit increased in compared to due to increased sales volume from our video processing systems 
for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold increased by  or million  to million from million for the year ended december  included in cost of goods are the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
these reserves were primarily related to lower of cost or market adjustments for raw materials and reserves for finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future 
during  cost of goods sold included a charge for an increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
this charge was primarily associated with our video processing systems products 
in  cost of goods sold was reduced as a result of a decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of million 
the decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories in was because we were able to sell certain products for which we had originally set aside reserves in prior years 
in addition to this million increase included in costs of goods from the change in reserves for excess and obsolete inventories from to  other significant increases in cost of goods sold 
table of contents included increases in labor expenses of million  outside contractor expenses of million  freight costs of million and amortization expenses of million 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in materials cost of million 
our gross profit declined in compared to due to decreased sales volume for both our video processing systems and our broadband transport and service management products 
the cost increases previously mentioned  including the increase in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  also negatively affected our gross profit in when compared to sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million due to additional headcount added during the year and additional headcount from our acquisition of copper mountain  million for travel costs  million for promotional and advertising costs  million for purchases of supplies and million for depreciation of equipment 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million in sales and marketing expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million due to additional headcount added during the year  million for promotional and advertising costs  million for facilities and infrastructure expenses and million in outside services expenses 
research and development 
for the year ended december   our research and development expense increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million increase in our research and development expense was due to a year over year increase in personnel related costs of million from additional headcount added from our acquisition of copper mountain  million from outside services  million for facility costs  million for the purchase of supplies relating to the development of our new product offerings and million for travel costs 
our capital expenditures for research and development were million in  million in and million for for the year ended december   our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our research and development expense was due to a year over year decrease in personnel related costs 
general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million increase in our general and administrative expense was primarily due to a million one time write off of costs relating to cosine s termination of the proposed merger offset by a decrease in outside services of million and franchise taxes of million 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our general and administrative expense was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs of million  lower insurance costs of million and contractors cost of million offset by higher relocation costs of million and outside service costs of million 
restructuring costs 
in september  we announced a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction 
as a result of this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million consisting of severance payments 
as of december   we have paid all of the costs relating to the restructuring 
we did not incur any restructuring costs for the year ended december  we incurred restructuring costs of million for the year ended december  in august  we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction and relocation 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of 
table of contents the restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges related primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million in relocation expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
impairment of assets 
during the third quarter of  we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the vtc acquisition had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain assets in our uk office had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the assets 
during the first quarter of  we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the purchase of the viagate technology assets had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of certain technology acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets of viagate 
the impairment costs have been included in cost of goods sold 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is comprised of intangibles related to the acquisitions of freegate  oneworld assets and xstreamis in  activetelco in  vtc in and copper mountain in the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization from these acquisitions consist primarily of completed technology and patents 
amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization expense included in cost of goods sold was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in when compared with was the result of intangible assets acquired as part of the copper mountain acquisition 
the million decrease in when compared with was the result of an intangible asset becoming fully amortized in gain on sale of investments 
the gain on sale of investments for the year ended december   resulted from the sale of certain equity investments that had been written down to zero in a previous year 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense 
interest and other income  net remained consistent at million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
for the year ended december   our interest and other income  net decreased to an expense of million from an income of  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to interest expense associated with the million note issued in connection with our purchase of vtc in november liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at december   reflecting a net reduction in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a higher net loss in compared with  and a higher accounts receivable and inventory balance which was partially offset by higher accounts payable balances in compared with the same period in cash used in investing activities included additions to property and equipment for the year ended december  of million compared with million in  and net cash acquired as part of the copper mountain acquisition of million offset by net purchases of short term investments of million 
in  we expect capital expenditures to increase compared with we expect these capital expenditures to be funded from operations and borrowings from our existing credit facility 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities in consisted of million from the issuance of private equity financing  million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan and net proceeds from the line of credit of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december   resulted primarily from our use of million for operating activities and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents from these uses was offset by million from the issuance of million additional common shares in a secondary offering and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations thousands total less than year years years thereafter line of credit long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capital lease commitments operating lease commitments purchase obligations total on september   we entered into a revolving asset based credit facility credit facility  with silicon valley bank the bank which was amended on december  as amended  this facility had an initial term of two years and expires on september  borrowings under the credit facility are formula based and limited to the lesser of million or an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is equal to the bank s prime rate  as of december   plus 
the rate may increase by if we do not meet certain financial covenants 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral  and the credit facility contains various covenants 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december  based on the maximum percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory levels  available borrowings under this facility were million as of december  in addition  this credit facility allows for long term borrowings of up to million for purchase of fixed assets 
we had outstanding borrowings of against the revolving credit facility and no long term borrowings against the credit facility at december  as part of our acquisition of vtc from tektronix in november  we issued a note payable to tektronix for million  with repayment in sixty months  or by november the interest rate on this note is and is compounded annually 
through january   the accrued interest is added to the principal balance of the note 
thereafter  we will pay accrued interest on this note commencing on january  and on each 
table of contents april  july and october thereafter until the principal balance is paid in full 
principal and accrued interest on the note payable is million at december  in july  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
under the terms of the sale  we also issued warrants to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock 
the warrants expire in and  beginning in  are exercisable at a per share price of 
we also have the right to call the warrants in the event that the trading price of our common stock exceeds per share for twenty consecutive trading days 
if exercised in full  the warrants would provide us an additional million in cash 
we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  negative cash flows from operating activities of million  and have an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facility as of december   are sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
in future periods  we generally anticipate that our cash flows from operations will begin to increase as a result of several factors  including our expectation that our revenue will increase and our net loss will decrease in as compared to accordingly  we expect the amount of cash used to fund our operations to decrease in however  in the event that we do not meet our revenue and earnings expectations  we may require additional cash to fund our operations 
failure to generate positive cash flow in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products  including third party products  through professional services  and through the sale of our software products 
we sell products through direct sales channels and through distributors 
generally  revenue is generated from the sale of video processing systems and components and the sale of broadband transport and service management products 
revenue is generated primarily from the sale of complete end to end video processing systems generally referred to as turnkey solutions 
turnkey solution revenue is principally generated by the sale of complete end to end video processing systems that are designed  developed and produced according to a buyer s specifications 
turnkey solutions are multi element arrangements  which consist of hardware products  software products  professional services and post contract support 
revenue is also generated from the sale of video processing component products and the sale of broadband transport and service management products and the sale of certain legacy products related to the acquisition of copper mountain 
we sell these products through our own direct sales channels and also through distributors 

table of contents our revenue recognition policies for turnkey solutions are in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  which is the authoritative guidance for recognizing revenue on software transactions and transactions in which software is more than incidental to the arrangement 
sop requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as hardware  software products  maintenance services  installation  training or other elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
if such evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop  as amended 
sop was amended in february by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop and was amended again in december by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
those amendments deferred and then clarified  respectively  the specification of what was considered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of software  which encompasses all of our turnkey arrangements  sop refers to the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue for all turnkey arrangements in accordance with sop and sop excluding the pcs element of the multi element arrangement  for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value as defined by sop  revenue from turnkey solutions is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  as stipulated by sop the percentage of completion method reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned that is equal to the ratio of labor effort expended to date to the anticipated final labor effort  based on current estimates of total labor effort necessary to complete the project 
revenue from the pcs element of the arrangement is deferred at the point of sale and recognized over the term of the pcs period 
generally  the terms of the turnkey solution sales provide for billing of approximately of the contract value prior to the time of delivery to the customer site  with an additional approximately of the contract value billed upon substantial completion of the project and the balance upon customer acceptance 
in connection with certain contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the revenue is billable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
the contractual arrangements relative to turnkey solutions include customer acceptance provisions 
however  such provisions are generally considered to be incidental to the arrangement in its entirety because customers are fully obligated with respect to approximately of the contract value irrespective of whether acceptance occurs or not 
for direct sales of video processing systems component products not included as part of turnkey solutions and the direct sale of broadband transport products and service management products  and the sales of legacy products related to the acquisition of copper mountain  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition 
at the time of the transaction  we assess a number of factors  including specific contract and purchase order terms  completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier  past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  evidence of sell through to the end user  and current payment terms 
based on the results of the assessment  we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition of revenue until evidence of sell through occurs and cash is received 
in order to recognize revenue  
table of contents we must also make a judgment regarding collectibility 
management s judgment of collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection and to new customers for which such history may not exist 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
new customers are typically assigned a credit limit based on a review of their financial position 
such credit limits are only increased after a successful collection history with the customer has been established 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  no credit is extended and revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs  as necessary 
estimated sales returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  as necessary 
our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase 
to date  warranty costs have been insignificant to the overall financial statements taken as a whole 
unbilled receivables 
unbilled receivables costs and estimated profit in excess of billings may be recorded in connection with certain turnkey solution contracts 
unbilled receivables are not billable at the balance sheet date but are recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we record provisions to write down our inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory provisions may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which amends fasb statement no 
and will be effective for public companies for first fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas r on january  on a prospective basis 
the new standard will require us to expense employee stock options and other share based payments 
the fasb believes the use of a binomial lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the black scholes options pricing model 
the new standard may be adopted in one of three ways the modified prospective transition method  a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we will adopt sfas no r using the black scholes options pricing model under the modified prospective transition method 
on december   the board of directors of approved full acceleration of unvested stock options with an exercise price of or greater previously granted under our stock option plan and non statutory stock option plan held our officers and employees 
options to purchase approximately  shares of the company s common stock  including approximately  shares held by our named executive officers  are subject to acceleration effective as of december  since we currently account for share based payments using the intrinsic value method under apb  we expect the adoption of sfas r will have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with non employees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected 
table of contents volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no 
r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sab will have on our results of operations when we adopt it in fiscal in june  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the previously issued authoritative guidance to clarify those abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and will be adopted by us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments
