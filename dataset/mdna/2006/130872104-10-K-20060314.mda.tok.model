part i item business overview we use our core technologies of liquid handling  automation  and labchip microfluidics to create enabling solutions for the life sciences industry 
we are a leader in microfluidic lab on a chip technologies 
in october  we acquired novascreen biosciences corporation  a provider of assay development and screening services for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry 
through our acquisition of novascreen  we are able to provide a comprehensive range of in vitro products and services 
within the life sciences industry we are currently pursuing two major markets drug discovery and development  and diagnostics 
in the drug discovery and development market  our products and services address many new challenges faced by pharmaceutical companies 
these challenges include late stage drug failures  increased research and development spending yielding fewer new drugs and  more recently  drugs being removed from the market due to unforeseen side effects that were not discovered in pre launch research and development or clinical trials 
our products help researchers make better choices earlier in their drug discovery process  increase the speed and efficiency of their high throughput screening efforts  and perform profiling experiments that can identify drug side effects earlier in the drug discovery process 
with respect to diagnostics markets  we believe that our labchip technologies may help reduce the high cost of many diagnostic tests  particularly molecular diagnostic tests  through integration and miniaturization of the various steps required to carry out these tests 
we are presently primarily working with collaboration partners in this area  although these projects are still in the feasibility or early development stages 
we have three channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  and through partnership channels under our caliper driven program 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell complete system solutions developed by us to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and 
table of contents distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
under this program  we supply liquid handling products  microfluidics chips  and other products on an oem original equipment manufacturer basis  and when requested provide product development expertise to our commercial partners  who then typically integrate an application solution and market it to their end customers 
in addition  as part of our caliper driven program we also provide licenses to our extensive microfluidic patent estate to other companies 
we view out licensing under our caliper driven program as a way for us to extend our microfluidics technology into certain application areas that we do not have a present strategic intent to address directly  or that may require the greater technical  marketing or financial resources of our licensing partner in order to obtain a more a rapid adoption of our technology in the particular application area 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market

the acquisition is expected to significantly advance our capabilities as a leading provider of tools and services that increase the productivity and clinical relevance of life sciences research  and is expected to accelerate our revenue growth and profitability 
the integration of molecular tool technologies presents a key opportunity to improve drug discovery research 
as highlighted in the fda critical path initiative  biomarker research and better experimentation models are essential to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory to commercial drug 
the combination of our proprietary microfluidic technology and automation expertise with xenogen s proprietary imaging technology addresses these key research needs by creating molecular level solutions that encompass in vitro test tube to in vivo living organism research 
these technologies offer exceptional data quality and productivity advantages  and combining them to offer a highly correlated suite of products and services should result in earlier  clinically relevant insights in the drug discovery process 
the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including the approval of xenogen and our stockholders  as well as standard regulatory approvals  and is expected to close in the second quarter of technologies  products and services labchip microfluidic technologies we have developed our labchip microfluidic technology to provide significant advances in laboratory experimentation for the pharmaceutical and other industries 
microfluidic chips are the key components of our labchip systems  which also include a labchip instrument and experiment specific reagents and software 
our chips contain a network of miniaturized  microfabricated channels through which fluids and chemicals are moved to perform experiments 
a single type of chip  used with customized reagents and software to perform a particular experiment  comprises one labchip application 
depending on the chip format  reagents are introduced either automatically or by the user 
the instrument and software control the movement of fluids through the chip via pressure or voltage  and an integrated optical system detects the results of the particular experiment 
because we have great flexibility in channel design  and can exert split second computer control over fluid flow  we have the ability to create chips for numerous applications 
our labchip systems miniaturize  integrate and automate experiments with the goal of providing the benefits of improved data accuracy and reproducibility  reduced cost and higher speed  leading to expanded individual researcher capability and improved enterprise wide productivity 

table of contents features of labchip systems miniaturization 
a conventional laboratory typically uses at least a drop of fluid  or to microliters  to perform each experiment 
in many labchip applications  the sample volume needed from external sources is reduced to below nanoliter  a reduction of up to  fold over conventional systems 
in some processes within the chip  reagents are dispensed in the microchannels in volumes down to tens of picoliters  another to fold reduction  which speeds analysis times and increases sample throughput 
a microliter is one millionth of a liter  a nanoliter is one billionth of a liter  and a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter 
integration 
integration is the combining of multiple processes into a single process  or the inclusion of multiple functions into one device 
today many laboratory systems perform only one or two steps of an experimental protocol 
our labchip systems can integrate complete experiments involving half a dozen or more steps into one continuous process performed on a single chip 
automation 
many laboratory experiments are performed in multiple manual steps 
with our labchip systems  entire experiments can be automated and performed inside a chip using one instrument  freeing up valuable research time and laboratory space and reducing labor requirements 
key benefits of labchip systems improved data quality and accuracy 
our labchip systems are designed to produce more accurate  consistent and reproducible data by reducing human error  reducing the variability caused by the use of multiple instruments  and enabling more analytical approaches to experimentation that are impractical in traditional systems 
for example  biochemical screening assays typically call for fast  bulk measurements of an experimental mixture 
reducing the size of the experiment allows for rapid separation and measurement of individual molecular species in the test mixture  which in turn enhances the accuracy of the overall result 
with higher quality data  our customers can make better decisions earlier in the drug discovery and development process 
this enables our customers to avoid the time and expense of performing additional analyses and experiments on false positive results from their primary screening experiments 
improved sensitivity 
when screening against drug targets  such as kinases  the higher quality data from our labchip systems allows customers to detect more subtle drug compound activities than can be detected with traditional microplate well based assays 
this has two advantages an increase in the pool of potential lead compounds  and the possibility that a hit found at lower levels of inhibition will be more selective for the target of interest than a hit found at higher levels of inhibition because compounds that hit at higher levels of inhibition may also produce unacceptable levels of inhibition on other  non target kinases 
reduced reagent and labor cost 
our labchip systems utilize only a small fraction of the usual amount of expensive reagents used in experiments performed in test tubes  well plates  or well plates  and also reduce the labor involved in each experiment 
we believe that saving on reagent cost and labor can enable pharmaceutical companies to expand the scale of experimentation in ways that would otherwise not be commercially feasible 
high speed 
we believe our labchip systems can  depending on the application  accelerate some experiments as much as fold or more 
for example  molecular separations such as electrophoresis may take two hours or more using conventional equipment 
on a chip  however  we can perform these separations in less than one minute 
faster assay development 
traditional assays  particularly those used for enzymatic screening  can require complex and time consuming assay development 
for example  some popular assays rely on developing specific antibodies for the assay a process that can take up to six weeks or more 
because they eliminate the requirement for assay development steps such as antibody preparation  labchip assays are much faster to develop 
in addition  we have exploited the predictable nature of fluid and reagent movement inside microfluidic channels and have developed software tools to facilitate the 
table of contents process of optimizing the experimental conditions necessary for a successful enzymatic assay on a labchip device  such as separating a substrate peptide from its product 
typically  our customers have found that these combined benefits shorten a two to three month assay development process for a traditional assay to just a week or two for a labchip assay 
expanded individual researcher capability 
because our labchip systems can combine a multi step  complex experiment into one step  we believe that individual researchers can perform experiments previously outside their areas of expertise 
by comparison  with conventional  non integrated equipment  researchers need to master the complexities of performing each individual step 
improved enterprise wide productivity 
we believe our labchip systems can improve data quality and reproducibility to the point where researchers can utilize data generated outside their laboratory or organization 
this has the potential to greatly improve enterprise wide productivity by supporting data sharing and reducing the need to repeat experiments 
for example  a typical primary screen produces approximate  yes no answers about the activity of library compounds against a particular kinase target  and therefore the information from such primary screens is only useful for one primary screening experiment 
with labchip assays  the primary screening data is more specific  in terms of the degree of inhibition  and more reproducible 
this could enable an organization to build a database of primary screening data that could ultimately be mined by other scientists within the organization interested in a particular compound target interaction 
although we believe our labchip technology has these potential advantages over more traditional technologies  not all laboratory processes are ideally suited to be performed using our labchip systems 
for example  detecting clinically important materials that appear in low concentrations in a sample  such as the virus that causes aids  is not always practical with our microfluidic labchip systems 
this is because there is a risk that the virus will not be present in the very small sample volumes used by our chips 
as a result  in certain applications use of our labchip microfluidic system may require the pre processing of a sample to increase concentration 
furthermore  if the analysis of a sample must involve even one process that cannot currently be performed in the labchip system  then use of the system for the parts it can perform is often impractical 
this is because the very small scale of the chip experiment does not generally produce enough material to be analyzed by conventional laboratory equipment 
our products we offer a full range of products that includes high and ultra high throughput screening systems  automated electrophoresis systems  liquid handlers  advanced robotics  storage devices  dissolution  extraction and evaporation workstations 
in addition  we derive a substantial portion of revenue from services and aftermarket products  including consumable and accessory products such as labchip devices  pipette tips  filters  glassware and storage trays 
we group our key product offerings into two general categories  drug discovery and life sciences research  or drug discovery  and pharmaceutical development and manufacturing  or drug development  to reflect the markets they primarily address 
drug discovery products high throughput screening systems and integrated workstations labchip drug discovery system 
the labchip system is our flagship microfluidic system for the drug discovery market 
using proprietary sipper chips to automatically sample library compounds from or well plates  the labchip performs unattended  high volume screening  producing high quality data that minimizes false positives and false negatives and detects weak inhibitors with high accuracy  potentially identifying drug candidates that conventional techniques can miss 
each chip has either or sippers  small glass capillary tubes attached to the chip 
once the researcher prepares the chip and places it into a labchip system  minute quantities of sample can be introduced  or sipped  through the capillary tube onto the chip 
this sipping process can be repeated many times with different compounds  enabling a single chip to analyze thousands of samples quickly and without human intervention 

table of contents assays are available for the labchip system for enzymatic drug targets such as kinases  proteases  phosphatases  and lipid modifying enzymes  and cell based targets such as g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs 
new capabilities allow screening against both adherent and non adherent cell types  and the small volumes of cells required enable screening against cells that are in short supply  for example primary cells 
we have identified compound selectivity screening  especially for kinases  as an emerging opportunity within the drug discovery market 
a typical kinase drug development program will focus on finding lead compounds that inhibit a particular kinase thought to play a role in the disease being studied 
as scientists learn more about the human kinome  the collective term for the different kinases found in the human body  they also are becoming increasingly concerned about the interactions of lead compounds on non target kinases  and the potential adverse side effects resulting from these interactions 
as a result  selectivity or profiling screens  where lead compounds are screened against a representative group of human kinases  are increasingly becoming a routine part of drug discovery programs 
our labchip system has the ability to generate the highest quality data for this kind of experimentation 
in addition  the system is a fast  cost effective way to generate numerous assays to meet the evolving requirements of pharmaceutical companies specific profiling strategies 
in  some of our newer profiling customers also requested that we provide assay development services to them 
this trend continued and strengthened in  and was a key factor in our decision to acquire novascreen which provides assay development services in addition to screening and profiling services

the sciclone i series  based on mems microelectromechanical systems technology  addresses volumes ranging from nanoliters to milliliter  and embeds real time adaptive algorithms ensuring consistent liquid delivery in changing environmental conditions such as temperature and sample viscosity 
each pipetting channel can dispense an independent volume and offers its own liquid level detection capability  allowing scientists to poll a plate to determine the liquid level and volume in each well 
the benefit of this type of control over the dispensing and monitoring of fluids is higher quality data and increased probability that a particular experiment will not have to be repeated 
both series of the caliper sciclone liquid handler offer multiple accessories such as an independent channel pipettor for single well access  and bulk reagent dispense modules for efficient reagent broadcasting 
other available accessories include the sciclone gripper  microplate shakers  a positive pressure filtration system  and temperature controlled locators 
the control software enables ease of use capabilities and supports cfr part compliance 

table of contents the caliper sciclone liquid handler can be used as a standalone instrument  or integrated in a more complete system that incorporates automated plate carriers such as our twister robot  and other analytical instruments

twister i has a capacity of microplates  and is used as a dedicated autoloader with a wide variety of scientific instruments 
the twister ii  sold exclusively to our oem partners  provides increased capacity  handling up to standard microplates and increased integration capabilities compared to twister i 
separations and analysis labchip automated electrophoresis system 
our labchip automated electrophoresis system automates the sizing and concentration analysis of proteins and dna fragments  and is designed to meet the needs of higher throughput research and production laboratories that presently use sds page and agarose gel electrophoresis 
using our proprietary microfluidic sipper chips to introduce samples directly from well or well plates  the labchip provides walk away automation  reduced analysis time  and immediate reporting of high quality sizing and concentration data 
for dna and protein separations  the labchip provides an automated  higher throughput alternative to the agilent bioanalyzer and bio rad experion systems  each of which are discussed further below under the caption  key corporate partnerships 
automated electrophoresis is still in its relatively early stages of market adoption 
however  as scientists identify needs for higher throughput research  they are increasingly finding the throughput  data quality and reporting capabilities of the labchip system attractive 
in response to the slow initial market reaction  we modified the software of the labchip system to make the instrument more compatible with the workflow requirements of a typical laboratory  and introduced a new  faster and more sensitive protein assay  which we refer to as the protein express assay 
we have also focused our marketing activities to better position labchip and support sales related activities in order to convert opportunities into new sales 
as a result  market adoption for labchip increased in the latter half of drug development products our drug development workstations fully automate quantitative sample preparation and analysis of pharmaceutical samples  such as tablets  capsules  granulations and bulk drugs

customers our current customers include many of the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as oem providers of complementary life science solutions 
approximately   and of our total revenues for   and  respectively  were derived from customers in the united states 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for revenues from customers and long lived assets attributable to geographic areas outside of the united states 
during  agilent accounted for approximately of our total revenue and of our product revenue 
no other customer exceeded of our revenue in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we typically experience higher revenues in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the capital spending patterns of our customers 
backlog for a portion of our sales  we manufacture products based on our forecast of customer demand and maintain inventories in advance of receipt of purchase orders 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon 
table of contents a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in the same quarter  shipments from our backlog of orders from previous quarters  and recognition of revenues that had been previously recorded as deferred revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
our products are typically shipped within ninety days of purchase order receipt 
as a result  we do not believe that the amount of backlog at any particular date is indicative of our future level of sales in any succeeding quarter 
the level of backlog at december  was million 
in our backlog  we include only the total value of open purchase orders for products and services that management has concluded have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve month period 
this amount specifically excludes deferred revenue  and products and services to be provided in the future pursuant to terms of contractual agreements for which we have not yet received purchase orders 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all product sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for products to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility into future product shipments  and our results of operations are subject to variability from quarter to quarter 
research and development we have made substantial investments in lab on a chip research since our inception  and believe that we have established a leading position in lab on a chip technology 
since our realignment following our acquisition of zymark corporation in july  we have made some important changes to our approach to research and development  or r d  which have resulted in a substantial decrease in our research and development expenses 
first  we are now emphasizing what we refer to as a sequential  rather than parallel  approach to our r d projects  meaning that we now undertake r d projects in a more selective manner  rather than pursuing all of our projects at the same time 
in doing this  we are prioritizing those projects that we believe have the greatest potential commercial value 
second  we are now emphasizing a shared investment risk approach to r d in which we have our customers or potential customers share in the expense of an r d project 
in  customer funding  which we include in our contract revenues  was approximately of our research and development expense 
this percentage could vary significantly in a given year based on our ability to obtain customer funding 
nonetheless  we believe that this shared investment risk model is important not only because it offsets at least a portion of our r d expense  but also because it provides important customer validation that a particular r d project has potential commercial value 
through these measures  we have been able to reduce our research and development expenses and utilize our resources more efficiently 
today we have ongoing core technology research and applied product development efforts in several areas technology research our technology research activities fall into several classes 
chip design 
we are increasing our understanding of the design rules guiding the development of new microfluidic chips using a variety of materials including glass  quartz  and plastics 
using the principles of physics and engineering  we create patterns of interconnected channels that permit execution of the various common steps of experimentation 
designs from one chip can be used for other chips needing similar fluidic functions for a different application 
analytical and computer simulation models are employed to minimize the number of iterations necessary to achieve new functional chip designs 
these modeling capabilities are also essential for optimizing assay conditions for specific analytes and reagents  on chip thermal control  and determining quality control parameters for production chips 
chip manufacturing 
we continue to seek ways to improve the yield and decrease the cost of manufacturing our chips 
we are exploring novel fabrication techniques and the use of new materials that offer functional advantages  such as superior optical features or lower manufacturing costs 
we have development programs exploring manufacturing technology for chips made of plastic 
plastic devices potentially offer cost 
table of contents advantages and can offer favorable surface chemistry or design features for some applications 
one area of continuous improvement is micromachining technology for precisely attaching capillaries to our sipper chips 
in automated experimentation  the number of these capillaries governs the level of throughput 
accordingly  we have developed high yield fabrication methods to enable us to cost effectively manufacture chips with many capillaries 
another important area of development is surface chemistry  in particular  controlling the reproducibility of channel surface characteristics in our labchip products 
instrument manufacturing and software design 
we use the skills of electrical engineers  optical engineers  mechanical engineers  product designers and software engineers to create new instruments and software 
the instruments are designed to optimize liquid handling and automation of life science laboratory applications  or to control fluid movement  temperature control  and detection functionality for our microfluidic chips 
software engineers write computer programs to manage tasks such as controlling chip functionality  collecting data  communicating between different instrument modules and communicating between caliper s and other manufacturer s instruments 
currently  our instrument research and development efforts are focused on the miniaturization of fluidics  robotics for target preparation and handling of microarray chips  the development of modular microfluidic instrument components that can be combined with other types of instruments and liquid handling equipment  depending on the desired application  high efficiency liquid handling workstations  the development of software to promote integration capability  and continued development of productivity workstations for genomics and biotech 
systems and assay integration 
when developing commercial products  we seek to incorporate functionalities that are necessary to perform a specific experiment  and configure the assay so that it offers tangible benefits to users 
by carefully characterizing the problems and existing bottlenecks in an end user s workflow  as well as the solution  we are able to define precise product specifications 
the resulting complete solution often includes a labchip device  liquid handling to manage bulk reagent needs of the chip  instrumentation to control flow and temperature  robotics for automating the handling of sample plates and detection optics  computer software for instrument control and data analysis  and reagents 
in recent developments  we continue to increase functional integration on chip  including sample purification  reaction reagent assembly  reaction incubation sometimes with temperature cycling  post reaction separation  and detection 
applications and product development we have developed expertise in discovering new functions that microfluidic chips can perform 
we generate computer models of how an experiment can be carried out  store these functional designs  and incorporate them into new designs that simulate complete experimental pathways 
in this way  we believe the value of new microfluidic inventions can be rapidly expanded across many application development projects 
drug discovery is one application area that has benefited greatly from microfluidics 
higher data quality allows more subtle inhibitors to be discovered using our labchip platform 
a current area of focus is kinase selectivity screening 
the labchip system can be used to understand how candidate drug compounds react with a particular kinase drug target relative to other kinase molecules in the human body  with potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the resultant drug 
we have developed more than kinase assays that can be provided to the customer to facilitate implementation of their kinase selectivity screening programs 
we are also expanding the panels of biochemical assays to other classes including proteases  phosphatases  and lipid modifying enzymes 
a key advantage of the labchip is its ease of use for measuring the kinetic parameters to determine the mechanism of actions of interesting inhibitors 
another labchip application is cell based screening against gpcr targets 
due to the greatly reduced 
table of contents consumption of cells and reagents  this application is well suited for screening of primary cells  which are believed to be more physiologically relevant to drug discovery 
another application focus area is the development of tools to improve proteomics and genomics research 
our high speed protein separation assay for the labchip platform increases productivity in protein expression  protein purification  and antibody engineering laboratories 
our fast dna sizing assay continues to automate workflow in post pcr analysis and quality control of amplification products 
with these applications  we achieve automated sampling of protein and dna samples from microplates using sipper chips  and the digital data output can be easily manipulated and analyzed to greatly reduce the time to answer 
to further enhance workflow and ease of use for our customers  we are expanding the software capability to rapidly analyze data from multiple wells  multiple plates  and multiple data files 
we are also extending the size range of these applications to meet new market needs 
we have also increased our application focus on more traditional macrofluidic automation products  such as liquid handling  plate handling  and complete automation systems 
our applications group works closely with key customers to understand their critical application needs 
these needs are then addressed directly by developing specific automation configurations and software specified methods that are optimized for key applications such as cell based assays  nucleic acid purification  and mass spectrometry sample preparation 
for example  our staccato platform has been configured specifically for cell based assays and is now marketed as a standard application system 
extensions to our liquid handling and automation product lines are ongoing 
these include the development of additional application based staccato systems and the further development of our liquid handling automation to include positive pressure filtration  low volume disposable tips and enhanced nanoliter dispensing and feedback control capability 
we are also developing extensions of certain existing products to address applications of high interest to our partners  such as the automation of target preparation for affymetrix s gcas system 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to decrease in the future to the extent our revenues grow and as we slow the pace of discretionary spending on research programs by focusing on those opportunities with maximum commercial viability and sharing the funding of r d programs with other partners 
manufacturing effective in november  we consolidated all instrument manufacturing in our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing facility  which is iso compliant 
the international standards organization  or iso  sets international standards for quality in product design  manufacturing and distribution 
we manufacture some subassemblies ourselves and other components are made to our specifications by outside vendors 
to ensure the quality and on time delivery of parts and subassemblies  we track our top suppliers and score them on a monthly basis 
the subassemblies are inspected and tested before being placed into final product assemblies 
production cycle times range from several hours to five days for more complex workstations 
systems and workstations are produced from components based on a wide variety of proprietary technologies  including intricate mechanical actuators  precision fluid handling systems  computers and software 
we produce systems by combining certain of our products with third party vendor equipment  primarily detection instrumentation 
the systems are a combination of standard components  assembled in either standard or custom configurations to meet a customer s specific needs 
a typical production cycle ranges from to days from receipt of an order to shipment of a system 
the final products are then put through an extensive testing cycle before being released for shipment 
testing at our factory and or the customer s site establishes that the system is performing to the customer s specifications 
we manufacture all of our chips in a class clean room facility in mountain view  california 
caliper is iso compliant for the development  manufacture and distribution of its chips and 
table of contents reagents 
we contract with third parties to supply raw materials  component parts and sub assemblies used in our chips and reagents kits 
we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure for the manufacture and distribution of our chips while reviewing outsourcing options for manufacturing our products at a lower cost 
for a discussion of the methods we use to manufacture our chips see the sections above titled technology  products and services and research and development 
suppliers we obtain key components of our chips  instruments and reagent based products from a number of suppliers  including  in certain cases  single source or limited source suppliers 
a third party supplies us with its proprietary dyes  which are used in many of our labchip products 
furthermore  we depend on a foreign single source supplier for the manufacture of glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of our chips 
the majority of key components for our chip and instrument products are available on short lead time from our suppliers 
the only component requiring any significant lead time to acquire is our glass stock  as our supplier requires a minimum order to cover an entire production run 
we anticipate that inventories of this material  at current production levels  will be sufficient for the next months 
although we have established licensing arrangements and supply agreements with most of our suppliers  there can be no assurances that these companies could not in some way be adversely affected in the future and be unable to meet our critical supply needs 
if the supply of components from these suppliers were interrupted  we might not be able to manufacture our products at all or in a timely fashion  which would disrupt our delivery of products to our customers 
competition in general  markets for instruments designed for life sciences applications are very competitive  and we believe these markets will remain competitive in the future 
the competition we face in these markets arises from other companies selling instruments that are directly competitive with our instruments  and from companies selling other types of instruments who are competing for the same  scarce funds in a potential customer s capital budget 
we encounter competition from a number of life science tools companies  especially in the areas of liquid handling  separations analysis  and high throughput screening 
in particular  we anticipate that our competition in the future will come primarily from companies providing competitive liquid handling products  automation products and integration services for applications similar to ours 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are productivity enhancement  breadth of applications  accuracy  ease of use  price  performance  product reliability and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including tecan  beckman coulter  velocity  applied biosystems division of applera  and perkinelmer 
companies supplying conventional technologies for gel electrophoresis separations for proteins  dna and rna 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per sample analyzed  throughput and productivity enhancement  data quality  ease of use  and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including agilent  bio rad laboratories  and beckman coulter 
companies supplying products for high throughput screening for the discovery of new drug compounds 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per compound analyzed  throughput  data quality  ease of use  reliability  and service support 
competition for these types of products and services comes from many companies  including ge healthcare  molecular devices  perkinelmer  and tecan 
companies supplying assay development  screening and profiling services to drug discovery and development laboratories 
we believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are cost per compound tested  data quality  and turn around time 
competition for these types of products and 
table of contents services comes from many companies  including cerep  mds pharma  serologicals  invitrogen  and carna biosciences 
we believe our products compete favorably with respect to all of these factors in each of these markets 
however  in markets where we sell products based on our labchip technology  we not only need to demonstrate the advantages of our products over competing technologies and products  but we must also often overcome a customer s resistance to switching from a well established  familiar technology to a fundamentally new technology 
we also need to compete effectively with companies developing their own microfluidics or lab on a chip technologies and products  such as fluidigm  gyros  micronics  tecan  biotrove  microfluidic systems  nanostream  m  applied biosystems  and cepheid 
microfluidic technologies have undergone and are expected to continue to undergo rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in these and future technologies  which we may not be able to do 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
although we formed a new five year agreement with agilent in june for the supply of planar chips  there is still the possibility that we may experience increased competition from agilent in the future 
for example  our labchip automated electrophoresis system provides many of the same capabilities as the agilent system launched by agilent in under the surviving terms of our original collaboration agreement  agilent has a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies 
under the terms of this license  agilent is able to develop  make and sell labchip devices in the field of our collaboration with agilent 
in many instances  particularly with respect to our liquid handling and automation products  our competitors have or may have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
our competitors also generally have greater name recognition than we do  and may offer more favorable pricing as a competitive tactic 
in addition  given the larger scale of their operations  most of our competitors spend more on research and development than we do 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete 
also  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
intellectual property we seek patent protection for our lab on a chip and other technologies 
as of december   we owned or held licenses to over issued us patents and approximately pending us patent applications  some of which derive from a common parent application 
the issued us patents expire between and foreign counterparts of many of these patents and applications have been filed and or issued in one or more other countries  resulting in a total of more than issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries as of december  these patents and applications are directed to various technological areas which we believe are valuable to our business  including control of movement of fluid and other material through interconnected microchannels  continuous flow  high throughput screening assay methods and systems  analytical and control instrumentation  analytical system architecture  automated liquid handling systems  
table of contents chip based assay chemistries and methods  chip compatible sample access  software for control of microfluidic based systems and data analysis  and chip manufacturing processes 
we also rely upon copyright protection  trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our lab on a chip technology 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties which give us rights to use certain technologies 
for example  we have exclusive licenses in the fields we are currently operating in from ut battelle  llc  relating to patents covering inventions by dr 
j 
michael ramsey  and from the trustees of the university of pennsylvania covering microfluidic applications and chip structures 
these licenses extend for the duration of the life of the licensed patents 
a failure to maintain some or all of the rights to these technologies could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we continuously assess the compliance of our operations with applicable federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
our policy is to record liabilities for environmental matters when loss amounts are probable and reasonably determinable 
our manufacturing and laboratory sites utilize chemicals and other potentially hazardous materials and generates both hazardous and non hazardous waste  the transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of which are regulated by various governmental agencies 
when needed  we have engaged environmental consultants to assist with our compliance efforts 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental permits and are aware of our responsibilities under applicable environmental laws 
any expenditures necessitated by changes in law and permitting requirements cannot be predicted at this time  although we do not expect such costs to be material to our financial position  results of operations or competitive position 
other business risks in addition to the risks to our business associated with suppliers  competition and intellectual property discussed above  our business is subject to a number of other significant risks  including the risks that our products may not achieve wide market acceptance and that we may not be successful in developing new and enhanced products 
these and other risks that may cause our actual results  financial performance or achievements to be materially different from our present expectations are discussed in more detail below under item a risk factors 
employees as of december   we had a total of employees  including in research and development  in operations and service  in sales and marketing and in administration and finance

item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our labchip products may not achieve widespread market acceptance  which could cause our revenue to grow slowly or decline and make it more difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability 
the commercial success of our labchip products depends upon market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery and automated electrophoresis separations systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
however  because our microfluidic drug discovery and automated electrophoresis systems have been in operation for only a limited period of time  their accuracy  reliability  ease of use and commercial value have not yet gained widespread commercial acceptance 
if these systems do not continue to gain further market acceptance  our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline 
in addition  our strategy for the labchip system  our microfluidic based high throughput screening product  depends upon the early users of these systems buying additional units as they spread the adoption of this technology throughout their organizations worldwide 
new customers for our drug discovery systems may wait for indications from our initial drug discovery system customers that our drug discovery systems work effectively and generate substantial benefits 
if the early users of our labchip systems do not endorse the further adoption of these systems because they fail to generate the expected quantities and quality of data  are too difficult or costly to use  or are otherwise deficient in meeting the screening needs of these customers  further sales of these systems to these early users may be limited  and sales to new users will be more difficult 
because drug screening systems represent substantial capital expenditures  it is important that these systems be capable of performing a wide variety of different types of assays and experiments in order to justify the cost of the systems 
we intend to continue developing new versions of our microfluidic based drug discovery systems with enhanced features that address existing and emerging customer needs  such as offering a broad range of standardized  easy to use assays 
if we are unable to do so  our drug discovery systems may not become more widely used and we may experience a decline in revenue or slow revenue growth and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we currently have several assays in development  including assays that measure many important activities of cells and proteins 
we are also developing product extensions that are particularly well suited for the evaluation of kinases  one of the largest focus areas of drug discovery efforts today 
we are also developing kinase profiling and selectivity screening kits 
if we are not able to complete the development of any of these expanded applications and tools  or if we experience difficulties or delays  we may lose revenues from our current customers and may not be able to obtain new customers 
to date  a large portion of our microfluidic based drug discovery systems have been sold as a result of senior level relationship selling and we have not yet achieved broad based sales of our labchip microfluidic instruments through our sales and marketing organization 
in addition  these systems and their underlying 
table of contents technologies are still relatively new to our sales and marketing organization  which may limit our ability to effectively market and sell these systems 
if we cannot market and sell these systems effectively  market acceptance of these products may be limited 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we cannot assure you that our efforts to increase the adoption of our labchip based high throughput drug screening and automated electrophoresis systems  by both existing and new users  will be expeditious or effective 
in summary  market acceptance of our labchip systems will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate the advantages and potential economic value of our labchip drug discovery systems over alternative  well established technologies  our ability to develop a broader range of standard assays and applications that enable customers and potential customers to perform many different types of experiments on a single labchip instrument system  and our ability to market and sell our drug discovery systems and related consumable products through our marketing and sales organization without the involvement of our senior management 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced liquid handling  labchip and other life sciences products  we may lose market share to our competitors 
the life sciences productivity tools equipment market is very competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
the commercial success of our liquid handling systems  labchip and other products depends upon continued improvement of our products and expanding market acceptance of our systems and products by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and genomics research organizations  and upon our ability to address quickly any performance problems that our customers encounter 
we anticipate that our competitors will introduce new  enhanced products in this market in the near future 
our future success will depend on our ability to offer new products and technologies that researchers believe are an attractive alternative to current products and technologies  that address the evolving needs of our customers  and that are technologically superior to new products that may be offered by our competitors 
the product development process is inherently uncertain 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts for new products and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new products in this market could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage  or enable a competitor to achieve greater market share 
if we are not successful in improving the cost of our labchip products relative to the performance delivered  we may not be successful in displacing alternative or more established products and technologies that are competitive with our labchip products 
customers in the life sciences productivity tools equipment market tend to be very price and cost sensitive relative to product performance 
the commercial success of our labchip products will depend not only upon our ability to demonstrate that their performance is superior to the performance of conventional products  but also that their total cost to purchase and operate is competitive with or lower than the cost of alternative or more established products 
we may need to reduce our manufacturing costs in order to sell our labchip products at more competitive prices 
although we have been successful in achieving significant reductions in the manufacturing costs of our labchip instruments and chips  we are engaged in ongoing efforts to further reduce the costs of our labchip products 
some of these efforts involve a substantial amount of technical risk  such as manufacturing our chips on plastic substrates rather than glass 
if we are not successful in achieving these additional cost reductions  the market demand for our labchip products may be limited and the rate of adoption of these products may be slower than we anticipate 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to achieve further cost reductions will be successful 

table of contents we are subject to the capital spending patterns of the pharmaceutical industry  which recently have been adversely impacted by general economic conditions  industry consolidation and increased competition  and which have resulted in severe price competition among suppliers of products to that industry 
many of our instrument products represent relatively large capital expenditures by our customers 
during the past several years  many of our customers and potential customers  particularly in the pharmaceutical industry  have reduced their capital spending budgets because of generally adverse prevailing economic conditions  consolidation in the industry and increased pressure on the profitability of pharmaceutical companies  due in part to more competition from generic drugs 
these conditions have resulted in increased price competition and downward pressure on prices for the products that we supply  in particular with respect to our liquid handling automation products 
if our customers and potential customers do not increase  or if they further reduce  their capital spending budgets because of continuing adverse economic conditions or further consolidation in the industry  we could face weak demand for our products 
if the demand for our instrument products is weak because of constrained capital spending by our pharmaceutical industry customers and potential customers  we may not achieve our targets for revenue and cash flow from operations 
in addition  if we are not able to obtain sufficiently high prices for our products due to ongoing price competition with other suppliers in our industry  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
our future revenue growth depends to a significant extent on sales by affymetrix of the gcas automated target preparation system  which is based on the caliper sciclone liquid handling instrument 
if end user demand for this product is not as strong as anticipated by affymetrix  our future revenue targets may not be achieved 
in collaboration with affymetrix  we have developed a new automated system for the preparation of nucleic acid target material to be applied to affymetrix s genechip devices  which system is based on our sciclone liquid handling instrument 
affymetrix began to ship the commercial version of the gcas system during the third quarter of under the terms of our collaboration agreement  affymetrix will market and sell the gcas system 
if affymetrix experiences difficulties in the marketing  sale  and support of this system  our future revenues will be less than anticipated 
in addition  because the gcas system is a new product for which there is no commercial experience  there can be no assurance that the demand for this product will materialize as expected 
our future revenue growth depends to a significant extent on the revenue growth of novascreen  which we recently acquired 
if novascreen s revenue does not grow as we anticipate  our future revenue targets may not be achieved 
in october we acquired novascreen biosciences  a privately held business which provides high throughput screening and compound profiling services 
we completed this acquisition  in part  because we believe that the market for these services will grow at a relatively high rate as more pharmaceutical and biotech companies increase their outsourcing of these services 
there can be no assurance  however  that pharmaceutical and biotech companies will continue to increase their demand for these services 
if the trend toward more outsourcing of these services does not continue to grow  our revenues from the novascreen business may not increase as anticipated  making it more difficult for us to achieve our future revenue growth targets 
a significant portion of our business depends upon collaborations with business partners  and our financial success depends upon our ability to develop new product concepts with compelling value propositions to generate new caliper driven collaboration relationships  as well as our ability to manage our existing relationships 
historically  an important part of our business strategy has been to collaborate with business partners in the development of new applications for our microfluidic and liquid handling products  and the subsequent commercialization of the developed products 
the costs associated with these product development efforts are generally significant  and the time to market for these product development efforts is generally two or more 
table of contents years 
accordingly  attracting a collaboration partner to undertake and underwrite a proposed product development effort requires a compelling value proposition 
moreover  even if we are successful in initiating a new product development effort with a caliper driven partner  these collaborations can be difficult to manage 
technical problems encountered in the development programs or disagreements with our business partners may adversely impact our ability to complete development programs  and therefore to realize increased product sales through these collaborations 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to define compelling new product concepts  or to identify new collaboration partners  or to identify new applications for our technologies to develop with our existing collaboration partners 
if we are unable to define new product opportunities or to identify new collaboration partners or to agree on the terms of a collaboration  or if we are unable to identify new applications for our technologies to develop and commercialize with an existing collaboration partner  our revenues could decline and the growth of our business could be adversely affected 
acquisitions may have unexpected consequences or impose additional costs on us 
our business is highly competitive and our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products  introduce new products on a timely basis and offer our customers products that provide a more complete solution 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies  such as our acquisition of zymark in july  our acquisition of novascreen in october  and our anticipated acquisition of xenogen in the second quarter of from time to time  we consider and evaluate potential business combinations involving our acquisition of another company and transactions involving the sale of our company through  among other things  a possible merger or consolidation of our business into that of another entity 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies and products and services of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential cost and disruptions caused by the integration of financial reporting systems and development of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  accounting consequences  including amortization of acquired intangible assets or other required purchase accounting adjustments  resulting in variability or reductions of our reported earnings  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in these markets have stronger market positions  the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired company due to the employment uncertainties inherent in the acquisition process  the assumption of known and potentially unknown liabilities of the acquired company  the risk that we may find that the acquired company or business does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the company or business was worth  we may disagree with the former management of businesses that we acquire with respect to the interpretation of provisions in the acquisition agreement relating to earn out provisions or other provisions that have ongoing effect after the completion of the acquisition  which could result in disputes or litigation with current employees who joined us as part of the acquisition  our relationship with current and new employees and customers could be impaired  
table of contents the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties who believe a claim against us would be valuable to pursue  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture and legal contingencies  among other matters  and there may be insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  or incur other large and immediate write offs 
we cannot assure you that future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business 
we must also maintain our ability to manage growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions that we make could harm our business 
our business and stock price may be adversely affected if the acquisition of xenogen is not completed 
our acquisition of xenogen is subject to several customary conditions  including obtaining clearance from governmental entities and the approvals of the transaction by the stockholders of xenogen and caliper 
if our acquisition of xenogen is not completed  we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and stock price  including the diversion of our management s attention from our day to day business as a result of efforts relating to the acquisition  the market price of shares of our stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed  under certain circumstances  we could be required to pay xenogen a million termination fee  we must pay costs related to the merger  such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees  and we would not realize the benefits we expect from acquiring xenogen 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the xenogen acquisition 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings  and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of xenogen with our business 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of xenogen 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly  and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  preserving our and xenogen s research and development  distribution  marketing  promotion  and other important relationships  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
we cannot assure you that the integration of xenogen with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger 

table of contents we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses each year since our inception and we expect to incur an operating loss in we may never achieve profitability 
as of december   caliper had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and product marketing and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
these costs have exceeded our cumulative cash proceeds which  to date  have been generated principally from product sales  collaborative research and development agreements  technology access fees  license fees  litigation settlement proceeds and interest income on cash and investment balances 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  many of our products represent relatively large capital expenditures for our customers  which leads to variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products because customers may take several months or longer to evaluate and obtain the necessary internal approvals for the purchase of our products 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of relatively high priced products  and these sales are generally made by purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
delays in receipt of anticipated orders for higher priced products could lead to substantial variability of revenue from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  we commonly receive purchase orders and ship a significant portion of each quarter s product orders near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  even short delays in the receipt of orders or shipment of products at the end of a quarter could result in shipment during the next quarter  which could have an adverse effect on results of operations for the quarter in which the shipment did not occur 
our business is affected by capital spending patterns of our customers with a greater percentage of purchases  and therefore we typically experience higher revenues in the second half of our fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
for all of these and other reasons  it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may fall abruptly and significantly 
because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a reliable indicator of our future performance 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangible assets are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
our revenue from agilent could decline due to a number of different factors  including a reduction in planar labchip purchases by agilent and reduced sales of the agilent bioanalyzer and labchip products sold by agilent  or reduced sales of such products by agilent due to competition from us or our other commercial partners 
under the terms of our supply agreement with agilent  which we entered into with agilent in june  agilent pays us a volume based purchase price for planar labchip devices that will be exclusively supplied by us 
under this new supply arrangement we will no longer receive revenue from agilent pursuant to a formula based on our manufacturing costs for planar labchip devices plus a share of agilent s gross margin from sales by agilent of labchip instruments and chips 
the volume of planar labchip device purchases by agilent is dependent upon sales of the agilent bioanalyzer and associated assay kits and other potential future systems and assays that may be developed by agilent 
if agilent s sales of these products do not increase  the amount of revenue we receive from agilent will decline 
in addition  under the surviving terms of our collaboration agreement with agilent  we granted to agilent a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to certain of our labchip technologies existing as of the termination date of the collaboration agreement for agilent to develop  make and sell products in the field of the 
table of contents collaboration 
consequently  there is the possibility that following the expiration of the five year term of the new exclusive supply agreement  or upon a breach of our obligations under the new supply agreement  agilent may manufacture its own supply of planar labchip products rather than purchasing them from us 
in addition  agilent could utilize its license rights to compete with us in other product areas in the future 
although this would generate royalty payments to us  such competition may reduce our ability to sell our own products independently or through other commercial partners 
in addition  agilent s sales of collaboration products could be reduced due to competition from us or our other commercial partners  such as bio rad 
in such event  the revenue we would receive from agilent could be reduced by more than the revenue we receive from other commercial partners 
further  agilent may decide  for reasons wholly independent of competition  to reduce its sales efforts and or pricing for these products 
if agilent does so  our revenue may decline 
we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management team  especially our chief executive officer  and certain of our scientific staff 
for example  many of our sales  particularly with respect to our labchip drug discovery systems  have resulted from the direct involvement of senior members of our management team  including our chief executive officer  with our customers senior level management 
none of our executives or scientists are legally bound to remain employed for any specific term 
the loss of services of any of these individuals could seriously harm our product commercialization efforts 
in addition  research and new product development will require additional skilled personnel in areas such as chemistry and biology  software engineering and electronic engineering 
also  the success of our novascreen operations is dependent upon the efforts of key management and scientific staff of that business 
our principal business locations in the united states are the silicon valley  california  and boston metropolitan areas  where demand for personnel with these skills remains high  and may increase further as the economic outlook in these areas improves 
as a result  competition for and retention of personnel  particularly for employees with technical expertise  is intense  and the turnover rate for these people is high 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
the inability to retain and hire qualified personnel could also hinder any planned expansion of our business 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
the technology fields in which we operate are still relatively new and evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including potentially treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology or potential products 
any public announcements related to litigation or patent interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
we rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position  especially in our microfluidics business 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  caliper may initiate patent litigation against third parties  such as the patent infringement suit against molecular devices we settled in november these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and divert management s 
table of contents attention from other business concerns 
in addition  these lawsuits would put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
we may also provoke a third party defendant to assert claims against us 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  will be commercially valuable 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive any of these results to be negative  it could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology to compete with us  and our ability to compete in the market or to maintain the gross margins on the products we sell would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights  or design around our proprietary technologies 
we are dependent on a single source supplier for the glass used in our labchip products and if we are unable to buy this glass on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our labchip products to customers 
we currently purchase glass  a key component for our chips  from a single source supplier located in germany 
although we keep surplus inventory in our mountain view manufacturing facility  if we are unable to replenish this component on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our chips to our customers  which would harm our business 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies for our products 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are provided by a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers  some of which are our competitors 
we currently purchase additional components  such as optical  electronic and pneumatic devices  in configurations specific to our requirements that  together with certain other components  such as computers  are integrated into our products 
we maintain only a limited number of long term supply agreements with our suppliers 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the risk that we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  that we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and that our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by suppliers 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained at the same prices and on substantially the same terms and conditions  if 
table of contents necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we might be forced to redesign our systems  which could prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources  and  therefore  their businesses could fail 
any inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and subassemblies could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our business 
if a natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would lose revenue 
we rely on a single manufacturing location to produce our chips and drug discovery systems  and a single location to produce laboratory automation and robotics systems  with no alternative facilities 
these facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time 
our manufacturing facilities may be affected by natural disasters  such as earthquakes and floods 
earthquakes are of particular significance because our labchip product manufacturing facility is located in mountain view  california  an earthquake prone area 
in the event that our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment are affected by man made or natural disasters  we would be unable to manufacture products for sale  meet customer demands or meet sales projections 
if our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased  it would harm our business 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  together with the revenue to be derived from our commercial partners and from commercial sales of our microfluidic and lab automation products and services  will enable us to maintain currently planned operations at least through the year however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including our acquisition of novascreen and our anticipated acquisition of xenogen  or of another company or business 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise needed capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have a nominal credit facility with an unused balance of  and we currently have no committed sources of capital 
to the extent that operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our tax net operating losses and credit carryforwards may expire if we do not achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through beginning in the year if not utilized 
state net operating losses of approximately  expired in the current remaining state net operating losses have varying expiration dates through utilization of the federal and state net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before 
table of contents utilization 
as described in note  subsequent to year end caliper announced a definitive agreement to acquire xenogen corporation xenogen  nasdaq xgen this acquisition will ultimately result in xenogen shareholders owning approximately one third of caliper and in all likelihood will result in a change of ownership that will cause pre merger losses to be subject to limitation 
the amount of limitation has not yet been determined 
because of our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty of realizing these net operating losses  the deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
risks related to owning our common stock our stock price is extremely volatile  and you could lose a substantial portion of your investment 
our stock has been trading on the nasdaq national market only since mid december we initially offered our common stock to the public at per share 
since then our stock price has been extremely volatile and has ranged  through march  from a high of approximately per share on march  to a low of per share both on january  and february  our stock price may drop substantially following an investment in our common stock 
we expect that our stock price will remain volatile as a result of a number of factors  including announcements by analysts regarding their assessment of us and our prospects  announcements by our competitors of complementary or competing products and technologies  announcements of our financial results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  and general market volatility for technology stocks 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have been sued  and are at risk of future securities class action litigation 
in the spring and summer of  class action lawsuits were filed against certain leading investment banks and over companies that did public offerings during the prior several years  including lawsuits against caliper and certain of its officers and directors as described under part i item legal proceedings 
this and other securities litigation could result in potential liability  cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management s attention and resources  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  announcements of future lawsuits of this or some other nature  and announcements of events occurring during the course of the current and any future lawsuits  could cause our stock price to drop 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition in which we are not the surviving company or which changes in our management 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination which includes us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock

we also believe novascreen will help us accelerate adoption of our technologies by creating new applications for our platforms 
within the life sciences industry  we are currently pursuing two major markets drug discovery and development  and diagnostics 
in the drug discovery and development market  our products address many new challenges faced by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
these challenges include late stage drug failures  increased research and development spending yielding fewer new drugs and  more recently  drugs being removed from the market due to unforeseen side effects that were not discovered in pre launch research and development or clinical trials 
our products help researchers make better choices earlier in their drug discovery process  increase the speed and efficiency of their high throughput screening efforts  and enable profiling experiments that can identify drug side effects earlier in the drug discovery process 
with the recent acquisition of novascreen  we now have the capability to perform high throughput screening and compound profiling services where our customers face internal capacity or instrument limitations 
with respect to diagnostics markets  we believe that our labchip technologies may help reduce the high cost of many diagnostic tests  and particularly molecular diagnostic tests  through integration and miniaturization of the various steps required to carry out these tests 
we are presently primarily working with collaboration partners in this area  although these projects are still in the feasibility or early development stages 
we have three channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  and through partnership channels under our caliper driven program 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell complete system solutions developed by us to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
under this program  we supply liquid handling products  microfluidics chips  and other products on an oem basis  and when requested provide product development expertise to our commercial partners  who then typically integrate an application solution and market it to their end customers 
in addition  as part of our caliper driven program we also provide licenses to our extensive microfluidic patent estate to other companies 
we view out licensing under our caliper driven program as a way for us to extend our microfluidics technology into certain application areas that we do not have a present strategic intent to address directly  or that may require the greater technical  marketing or financial resources of our licensing partner in order to obtain a more a rapid adoption of our technology in the particular application area 
by using direct 
table of contents and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market 
overview of financial performance our million of revenue in was consistent with our previous estimates 
revenue growth principally came from our drug discovery product family including from oem instrument sales  labchip systems  services  including drug discovery screening and profiling services of newly acquired novascreen  and license fees under our caliper driven program 
these growth areas were partially offset by lower revenues from our drug development product family and other instruments 
our selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses of million were million lower than  reflecting our continued efforts to control costs and manage toward profitability 
we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs  at least through the end of we achieved our long standing objective of attaining positive cash flows from operations during the fourth quarter of key developments several key developments in enhanced our strategic positioning for the future 
we achieved continued growth of revenue from our direct channel microfluidics products  strengthened our core business strategy through industry partnerships and increased focus on applications  and by signing several major licensing agreements under our caliper driven program  and completed the acquisition of novascreen during the fourth quarter of microfluidic adoption continues 
for the full year  we placed new labchip systems  compared to in we are continuing to build adoption momentum as of the top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies now own one or both of our labchip products  and multiple system adoption has occurred at several accounts 
industry partnerships strengthen 
late in the third quarter  our oem partner  affymetrix  launched the genechip array station gcas  an automated target preparation and microarray processing system that increases accuracy and lowers the total cost per sample for large scale studies 
by improving data consistency and decreasing the hands on time needed to perform experiments  the affymetrix gcas system enables scientists to accelerate discovery and to bring new tests and therapies to market more quickly 
during the second quarter  affymetrix also licensed a portion on our microfluidic patent estate enabling affymetrix to explore the development of products that use both our labchip and affymetrix s genechip technologies on one platform 
this value added approach of combining our core liquid handling and automation technologies with our partners application focus is an important strategy for sustaining growth of these products 
also in the second quarter  agilent obtained a license from us for the development of clinical diagnostic applications on agilent s bioanalyzer  its automated lab on a chip platform and future instrument platforms 
this new license agreement leverages the expertise and leading technology of agilent and us  enabling both companies to capitalize on the significantly expanding diagnostics market 
under a separate agreement  we also signed a new supply agreement with agilent under which agilent will purchase all planar chip products  for both research and diagnostic applications  from us for the next five years 
this agreement was a significant milestone as it added to the stability of our revenue by assuring that the demands for chips from our largest customer will continue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in the third quarter  bio rad  which launched its experion platform late in  signed a feasibility agreement with us for a new microfluidic system 
the placement of new partner systems and the development of new applications are important drivers behind our strategy to promote higher chip sales 
acquisition of novascreen 
the acquisition of novascreen in the fourth quarter was a major milestone in our strategy 
the addition of in vitro services to our in vitro product offerings allows us to meet the growing demand for outsourced assay development and profiling services and to take a leading position in high quality in vitro experimentation for drug discovery 
the novascreen integration was completed during the fourth quarter 
the acquisition not only improves our overall positioning  but also adds profitable and more predictable revenue streams to our business 
relying on novascreen s profiling expertise  initial progress has been made to develop assay panels for the labchip system 
the first  called kinase adviser  is a panel of kinases that helps drug discovery researchers monitor important potential safety issues for an emerging drug compound 
we intend to expand the panel of kinase assays capable of being run on the labchip system to approximately by the end of a second offering  the gensep ii panel  measures a more general spectrum of safety indicators to give scientists data about potential areas of concern for drugs entering later stages of development 
genesep ii incorporates an increased number of human receptor cell based assays  making the data that come from the panel more relevant to drug activity in human patients 
pending acquisition of xenogen 
on february   we announced entering into a definitive merger agreement on february  to acquire xenogen corporation  a maker of advanced imaging systems including instruments  biological solutions and software designed to accelerate drug discovery and development 
under the agreement  we will issue approximately million common shares and approximately million warrants to purchase caliper common shares in exchange for all of xenogen s equity securities outstanding at the closing 
as of february   the aggregate value of the caliper shares and warrants to be issued in connection with the merger was approximately million 
the acquisition is expected to significantly advance our capabilities as a leading provider of tools and services that increase the productivity and clinical relevance of life sciences research  and is expected to accelerate our revenue growth and profitability 
the integration of molecular tool technologies presents a key opportunity to improve drug discovery research 
as highlighted in the fda critical path initiative  biomarker research and better experimentation models are essential to improve predictability and efficiency along the critical path from laboratory to commercial drug 
the combination of our proprietary microfluidic technology and automation expertise with xenogen s proprietary imaging technology addresses these key research needs by creating molecular level solutions that encompass in vitro test tube to in vivo living organism research 
these technologies offer exceptional data quality and productivity advantages  and combining them to offer a highly correlated suite of products and services should result in earlier  clinically relevant insights in the drug discovery process 
the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including the approval of xenogen and our stockholders  as well as standard regulatory approvals  and is expected to close in the second quarter of the acquisition of xenogen will involve substantial risks and uncertainties  as follows xenogen s stockholders may not approve the transaction  the necessary regulatory approval may not be obtained or the companies may be required to modify aspects of the transaction to achieve regulatory approval  or the transaction otherwise may not close  prior to the closing of the proposed acquisition  the businesses of the companies may suffer due to uncertainty  the expected benefits  including revenue growth  from combining the two companies may not be realized  integration of the companies and their product portfolios following closing could prove more difficult and costly than expected  and planned synergies may not transpire  xenogen employees who are key to maintaining the revenue growth of xenogen s products may leave xenogen due to the uncertainties created by the merger  
table of contents the historic growth rate of xenogen s products may not continue as expected due to market saturation or to the failure to convince large pharmaceutical companies as to the value of xenogen s imaging technology  unanticipated difficulties may be encountered in connection with consolidating the operations of the two companies  and other factors that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties may cause actual financial results  performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated results 
keys factors affecting ongoing performance we have indicated that we will need to grow revenues significantly to reach profitability and to attain ongoing positive cash flows 
our recent acquisition of novascreen and announced plan to acquire xenogen are important milestones toward these objectives 
however  we continue to face risks and uncertainties that could challenge our efforts to grow revenue  gain market share and remain competitive 
our microfluidic technologies still require significant development investment  particularly in the area of diagnostics  and our drug discovery systems incorporating these technologies have only recently begun to be used commercially and are still in their adoptive stages 
if our drug discovery systems do not gain further market acceptance  we will be unable to generate significant sales of these products and our revenue may decline 
the commercial success of our drug discovery systems will depend upon capital spending by our potential customers  and the continuation of the growing market acceptance of the merits of our drug discovery systems by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and other companies that rely upon laboratory experimentation 
in addition  over the past twelve months we have experienced significant competition with our liquid handling and automation technologies within our direct market channels 
we have opted toward commercial partnerships  such as with affymetrix  to grow this area of our business 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties not only inherent in the general marketplace such as the amount capital spending on new life sciences research equipment  but are also subject to the risks and uncertainties facing our commercial partners to the extent that we place greater reliance on indirect sales and marketing via our partners 
beyond increasing our revenues  it remains important for us to continue to control costs  and particularly to improve our gross margins  to allow us to achieve profitability 
during  we demonstrated success in reducing our operating expenses  and we began initiatives that are targeted to achieve further costs savings  particularly in the source and supply of key manufacturing components and raw materials that factor into our product margins 
our ability to maintain control over costs and to achieve continued cost reductions involves risks and uncertainties  and if we are not successful  could delay our ability to achieve profitable operations 
results of operations revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands product revenue service revenue license fees and contract revenue total revenue total revenue 
our total revenue increase in resulted from growth in drug discovery product family including oem instrument sales  labchip systems  services  including the drug discovery screening and profiling services of newly acquired novascreen  and license fees under our caliper driven program 
these growth areas were partially offset by lower drug development product family and other instrument revenues 

table of contents product revenue 
product revenue increased in due to a growth in our drug discovery product lines  which represented of total product revenue which was offset partially by a decline in our drug development product lines  which represented of product revenue 
increased sales of caliper sciclone based instruments to affymetrix  and to a lesser extent increased sales of our labchip drug discovery and labchip automated electrophoresis systems and microfluidic labchip devices contributed to the drug discovery growth 
during  we placed a total of labchip systems in comparison to a total of systems during within our direct channel business  we have seen a continuation of conservative spending over the last twelve months by large pharma in the area of liquid handling which has caused increased competition and price pressure resulting in decreased direct channel sales of our caliper sciclone liquid handling instrument 
we see a continuation of very competitive conditions in liquid handling in decreased sales of multidose and tpw instruments accounted for the majority of the decrease in drug development product revenues 
we believe the decline in drug development product revenues is a temporary market condition that will continue until the expected launch of our new tpw iii tablet processing workstation in the second quarter of in general  we experience a less competitive environment for our drug development products than for our drug discovery liquid handling and automation products and we are optimistic that drug development product revenues will show improvement in the increase in product revenue in resulted primarily from having a full year of zymark s product revenues in versus a half year during when zymark was acquired 
this accounted for million of the overall increase 
in addition  we experienced an increase in microfluidic hts instrument sales as a result of the introduction of the labchip drug discovery system  which replaced the former caliper hts instrument  and increased planar chip sales as a result of greater sales to agilent  which accounted for the remainder of the increase 
service revenue 
novascreen service revenues provided for the majority of the service revenue increase during  along with increases in other service offerings 
we acquired novascreen on october  the increase in service revenue during was primarily due to the full year impact of zymark service revenues in in comparison to a half year during when zymark was acquired 
license fees and contract revenue 
revenue from new licenses granted under our caliper driven program provided for the majority of the revenue increase in  partially offset by a million decline in research and development collaborative funding 
collaborative funding declined in due to the completion in of a major collaborative project effort with bio rad that resulted in the launch of bio rad s experion instrument in the fourth quarter of the revenue decline during was primarily the result of aggregate license payments from aclara and molecular devices received in for which there were no comparable sized licenses in  partially offset by a net increase in collaboration funding during cost of revenue year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands cost of product revenue service revenue total cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
during  cost of product revenue increased primarily due to increased spending on materials 
our product mix in featured a greater proportion of revenue from sales of drug discovery instruments  including caliper sciclone sales to affymetrix and labchip systems  which bear a proportionately higher material cost as a percentage of revenue in comparison to our drug development and other specialty products 
in the fourth quarter of  we began an initiative to target material cost reductions through volume based purchasing economies  vendor outsourcing analysis and other identified opportunities 
in addition  we modestly increased selling prices for certain drug discovery instrument products 
in  we 
table of contents lowered our manufacturing costs by million 
this net decrease in spending was driven primarily by staff related cost reductions  including the elimination of a second manufacturing shift in our chip manufacturing operation  and reduced operating supplies usage 
these manufacturing savings were offset  however  by higher freight costs of million related to an increased number of shipments and higher fuel and other transportation charges  and other miscellaneous direct costs of million 
the increase in cost of product revenues in was primarily due to higher product revenues driven by the zymark acquisition  partially offset by million of reduced spending resulting from staffing reductions that occurred in the second half of in our microfluidic labchip manufacturing operation 
cost of service revenue 
the increase in cost of service revenue in included approximately million of service costs resulting from our acquisition of novascreen which was included in our operations only for the fourth quarter of the remaining net increase included million of allocated research and development staff related costs supporting assay development services  million of increased field service and customer support staff related costs  and an offsetting reduction of million due to reduced training costs as a result of training staff resources having been engaged to a greater extent in internal training and pre sales activities in in  the overall increase in cost of service revenue was primarily due the full year inclusion of legacy zymark service costs 
gross margins 
our gross margin on product revenue was for the year ended december   as compared to in the decrease from was comprised of a percentage point unfavorable change caused primarily by mix  a percentage point unfavorable change from the impact of freight and other miscellaneous direct costs and a percentage point favorable change from reduced manufacturing spending and volume based efficiencies 
the unfavorable mix change reflected several factors  including a shift in toward increased drug discovery products which exhibit a lower margin including the increase in sales to affymetrix  and sales in for which there were no associated costs which included million billed and collected from agilent to recover previously unbilled costs  and million from software upgrades for a discontinued oem product 
gross margin on service revenue was for the year ended december   which was slightly below due to service related costs increasing at a rate slightly above the rate of sales increase 
operating expenses year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  change change change change in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative employee stock compensation  net amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges credits research and development expenses 
in  the net decrease in research and development expenses was comprised of a million reduction for in process research and development charges  million of reduced staff related costs as a result of more focused project spending including approximately fewer personnel on average versus  million of reduced depreciation as a result of fully depreciated assets  million of reduced facilities and information technology cost allocation associated with lower staffing levels and square footage utilization within r d  million of increased project materials and other spending and million of new costs associated with our purchase of novascreen 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to generally decrease in the future  to the extent our 
table of contents revenues grow  and as we continue to closely manage discretionary spending on research programs with attractive commercial potential 
as part of our caliper driven program  we may undertake yet to be identified projects that could cause our r d costs to increase as a percentage of revenue  although such increased spending may be fully or partially funded by our commercial partners 
in  research and development expenses decreased  despite a full year of zymark related costs and a million in process r d charge  as a result of the prioritization of our r d programs and related downsizing activities that occurred in  and as a result of facility closures that occurred in the and restructuring activities are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  the net decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was comprised of a million reduction in depreciation as a result of fully depreciated assets and leasehold retirements  million of reduced professional costs including accounting fees  consulting expenses and outside patent costs  million of reduced miscellaneous taxes  insurance and other fees  and million of reduced miscellaneous spending across several expense categories  partially offset by spending increases including million of new costs added by novascreen and million of increased selling expense resulting from reallocated training department resources as discussed above 
in  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of zymark in the full year results of operations  offset in part by downsizing activities in and in implementation costs of section of the sarbanes oxley act of were approximately million versus insignificant costs in we expect selling  marketing and product promotion expenses to generally increase over the next several years as we continue to make investments to grow our sales  while declining as a percentage of total revenue 
employee stock compensation 
employee stock compensation includes the amortization of deferred stock compensation recorded based upon the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock issuances 
the decrease in employee stock compensation resulted from fewer stock based awards granted to employees and key executives in versus  and as a result of accelerated option vesting and other stock based charges associated with certain key employee severance agreements in the amortization expenses related to deferred stock compensation in and was net of reversals of  and  respectively  of stock compensation expense recognized in previous periods as a result of forfeited options 
the million of remaining deferred stock compensation included within stockholder s equity as of december  has not yet been adjusted for estimated forfeitures as required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment statement r  and would ordinarily result in compensation expense of million during and million during future periods beyond we expect that the total amount of employee compensation expense which we record in our income statement will increase  as a result of the adoption of statement r which requires all share based payments to employees be recorded as an expense based on their fair values 
we adopted the provisions of statement r as of january   and expect that the adoption will result in stock compensation expense of between and million in this estimate reflects our assumptions for share based payments to be made in  and does not incorporate the potential impact of acquisitions  such as xenogen see note 
restructuring charges 
during the period from may through december  caliper incurred restructuring charges and credits related to planned workforce reductions and facility closures that were undertaken by management to control costs and improve the focus of its operations in order to reduce losses 
certain of these activities took place following caliper s acquisition of zymark in  and were actions designed to eliminate redundant costs and to improve the overall operating efficiency of the newly combined business 
a more complete discussion of all restructuring activities occurring from may through december  is included in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

we also have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc and the trustees of the university of pennsylvania that in the aggregate would never exceed  per year 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs

we ended with million in total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe our current cash balances are adequate to satisfy our cash needs through the end of  including our initial assessment of cash needs resulting from our pending acquisition of xenogen 
notwithstanding  our actual cash needs could vary considerably  depending on opportunities and circumstances that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our research and development efforts  sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the inability to obtain additional financing may force delays in research and product development activities and  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
financial outlook 
for the first quarter and full year our outlook is as follows we project first quarter revenues in the range of to million 
assuming the successful closing of our planned acquisition of xenogen by the end of the second quarter of  we project our full year revenues will be approximately to million  subject to revision for the potential effects of purchase accounting on xenogen s deferred revenue as of the closing of the merger 
the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in item a 
risk factors 
in addition  the above full year revenue projection does not include the potential effects of purchase accounting on xenogen s deferred revenue 
in a business combination  the acquiring company records deferred revenue in an amount equal to the fair value of the assumed performance obligations  which may differ from amounts recorded on the balance sheet of the target company 
the potential impact of such purchase accounting adjustments to xenogen s deferred revenue cannot be fully evaluated until the merger closing 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   caliper did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  which are defined to include any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical 
table of contents experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded restructuring charges credits of million  million  and million  respectively 
we established exit plans for activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and ability of the tenant to pay leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of approximately million to recognize the net present value of future sublease rental income based upon subleases we were able to secure during for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether there is objective evidence of fair value for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize certain service and contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
we wrote off  and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in and  respectively 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excess 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is 
table of contents determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of  million and million to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
of the amount charged to cost of product revenue in  million was related to the discontinuance of the caliper drug discovery instrument 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
we offer a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is included in the sales price of many of its products 
our standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary 
goodwill 
we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
we performed our fiscal annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based upon our market capitalization at the time  we concluded that we did not have any impairment 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
valuation of intangibles 
we acquired novascreen on october  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the novascreen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from

revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
caliper has adopted statement r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
we intend to estimate the fair value of share based payments using the black scholes merton formula and to recognize the resulting compensation expense using a straight line recognition method over the applicable service period of each award 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share under stock based compensation in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
while we have not yet determined the specific level of share based payments to be granted in  using the approach described above we estimate that we will recognize share based employee compensation expense of between and million in statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under prior rules 
this aspect of the adoption of statement r is not expected to impact our cash flows or overall financial position due to our substantial net operating loss carryforwards  and the uncertain future tax benefit of recognized compensation cost

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by statement clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign operations for the fiscal year a hypothetical movement in exchange rates could materially impact our reported sales 
however  because both sales and expenses are denominated in local currency  this analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on net operating results or financial condition

we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or as of december  we had  in term debt outstanding  all of which debt was at fixed rates and  therefore  had minimal exposure to changes in interest rates
