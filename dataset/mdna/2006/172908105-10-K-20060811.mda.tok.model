results of operations fiscal marked the th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for cintas 
in addition to achieving this milestone  cintas experienced healthy improvements in profits  cash flow and balance sheet strength 
cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments  rentals and other services  based on the similar economic characteristics of the products and services within each segment 
the rentals operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments  mats  mops and shop towels 
in addition to these rental items  we also provide our restroom and hygiene products and services within this segment 
the other services operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items  first aid  safety and fire protection products and services  document management services and branded promotional products 
both segments provide these products and services throughout the united states and canada to businesses of all types from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated revenue rentals other services total revenue cost of sales rentals other services total cost of sales gross margin rentals other services total gross margin selling and administrative expenses interest income interest expense write off of loan receivable income before income taxes as evidenced above  our revenue growth was higher in other services versus rentals during fiscal and fiscal  resulting in a moderate shift in the percentage of revenue between our reporting segments 
this shift was mainly driven by the acquisitions of first aid  safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 
information related to acquisitions is discussed in note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal total revenue was billion  an increase of over fiscal internal growth improved in fiscal to  up from in fiscal our internal growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of uniform rental programs to new customers and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base 
the remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental  first aid  safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses 
information related to acquisitions is discussed in note entitled acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements 
rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments  and the rental and or sale of mats  mops  shop towels  restroom supplies and other rental services 
revenue from the rentals segment increased over fiscal the increase in rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base 
new business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling rental programs to new customers 
we also continued to expand our rental market  with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs 
internal revenue growth for the rentals segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma negatively impacted our rentals internal growth rate by approximately 
the of remaining growth in fiscal resulted from the acquisition of rental volume 
other services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design  manufacture and direct sale of uniforms and related items  first aid  safety and fire protection products and services  document management services and branded promotional products 
other services revenue increased over fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions of first aid  safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses 
internal revenue in the other services segment increased over fiscal this increase was mainly driven by the growth of the sale of first aid  safety and fire protection products and services and document management services 
we estimate that the effects of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma negatively impacted our other services internal growth rate by approximately 
growth in the other services segment continues to be through an increase in the customer base and through further penetration of additional products and services into our existing customer base 
cost of rentals increased over fiscal cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses  delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory  including uniforms  mats  shop towels and other rental items 
the cost increase over fiscal was primarily driven by the growth in rentals segment revenues 
however  rising energy costs also contributed to this increase 
rentals energy costs increased in fiscal  from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year helped offset the significant increase in energy costs 
as a result  cost of rentals as of percent of rentals revenues remained at in both fiscal and fiscal increases in energy costs will continue to impact our operating results negatively in coming quarters  except to the extent we are able to offset such costs with price increases and increased operating efficiencies 
our new orleans rental operation and gulf coast direct sale business continue to be impacted negatively by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
while physical damage to our facilities was minimal  many of our customers in the region have yet to reopen or to return to pre hurricane staffing levels 
this lower business volume will continue to have an impact on our results 
we are actively pursuing recoupment of our losses related to these hurricanes with our insurance carrier 
we do not yet have a clear indication of when a recoupment agreement will be resolved  nor can we be sure of the amount we will receive 
cost of other services increased over fiscal cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold predominantly uniforms and first aid products  delivery expenses and distribution expenses 
the increase over fiscal was due to the growth in other services revenue  derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
gross margin within this segment may fluctuate depending on the type of product or service sold  as more cost efficient sourcing is employed and as products which require additional services or specialization generate higher gross margins 
for example  tailored garments that incorporate high levels of design and customization tend to generate higher gross margins than work wear and standard catalog items 
the gross margin for fiscal is 
the gross margin for other services has historically been in the to range 
however  six sigma and other cost containment initiatives have allowed us to exceed this historical range 
due to the success of these initiatives and our continued efforts  we believe the future gross margins will be in the to range

the trustee seeks damages against cintas for allegedly breaching fiduciary duties to tmc and tuc and for allegedly aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by others to those entities 
the complaint also includes allegations that cintas breached certain limited liability company agreements  or alternatively  misrepresented its intention to perform its obligations in those agreements and acted as alter egos of the bankrupt tmc and is therefore liable for all of tmc s debts 
the trustee is seeking million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
cintas denies these claims and is vigorously defending itself against all claims in the complaint 
if there is an adverse verdict on the merits or in the event of a negotiated settlement of this lawsuit  the resulting liability could be material to cintas 
any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time 
the litigation discussed above  if decided adversely to or settled by cintas  may  individually or in the aggregate  result in liability material to cintas financial condition or results of operations 
cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits  and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of cintas shareholders 
cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations  as are other companies in the industry 
while environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs  cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs  primarily for water treatment and waste removal  on a regular basis 
environmental spending related to water treatment and waste removal was approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems  which are depreciated over a useful life of ten years 
cintas does not expect a material change in the cost of environmental compliance on a percent to sale basis and is not aware of any material non compliance with environmental laws 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an expense in the statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard is effective for public entities excluding small business issuers no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  cintas will adopt this statement on june  the effect of adoption of sfas r is currently estimated to be approximately million per share after tax for fiscal however  cintas actual share based compensation expense in fiscal depends on a number of factors  including fair value of awards at the time of grant 
critical accounting policies the preparation of cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note entitled significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes  estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized either when services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts cintas establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
this allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility 
an uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts  beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages 
the amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the rentals and other services segments  because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances 
the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification  as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence 
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization  calculated using the straight line method 
uniforms in service other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months 
other rental items including shop towels  mats  cleanroom garments  flame resistant garments  linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty eight months 
the amortization rates used are based on industry experience  cintas experience and wear tests performed by cintas 
these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings  five to twenty years for building improvements  three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the estimated future cash flows undiscounted are compared to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recorded 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values  as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value  less estimated costs related to disposition 
goodwill and impairment goodwill  obtained through acquisitions of businesses  is valued at cost less any impairment 
cintas performs annual impairment tests by segment 
these tests include comparisons to current market values  where available  and discounted cash flow analyses 
significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth 
based on the results of the impairment tests  cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended may   or service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets  which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses  are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements  which are generally five to ten years 
certain noncompete agreements  as well as all service contracts  require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates  among other factors 
because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets  actual results over time could vary from original estimates 
impairment of service contracts and other assets is through specific identification 
no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the years ended may   or litigation and environmental matters cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded 
while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities  cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements 
a detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled litigation and other contingencies 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
please reference note entitled income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date 
cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate 
based on cintas evaluation of current tax positions  cintas believes its accruals are appropriate 
outlook our outlook remains positive for fiscal in an effort to further increase our revenue  we are reorganizing our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive 
we will also continue searching out additional products and services to become an even more valuable resource for our customers 
as such  we see upside potential for all of our business units 
although difficult to predict  we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units 
in the marketplace  competition and related pricing pressure will continue  however  we believe cost containment initiatives  technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact 
when appropriate opportunities arise  we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
like most other companies  we experienced  and anticipate continuing to experience  increased costs for wages and benefits  including medical benefits 
changes in energy costs and changes in federal and state tax laws also impact our results 
cintas continues to be the target of a corporate unionization campaign by unite here and the teamsters unions 
these unions are attempting to pressure cintas into surrendering our employees rights to a government supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation 
cintas philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward we believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no 
this campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations 
we will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees rights 
we believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure  quality products  financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success 
however  a number of factors influence future revenue  margins and profit which make forecasting difficult 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt  marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements 
earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately million  with an average interest rate of 
this exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short term rates 
if short term rates change by one half percent or basis points  cintas income before taxes would change by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
this analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in cintas capital structure 
through its foreign operations  cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary foreign currency to which cintas is exposed is the canadian dollar 
cintas does not currently use forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from foreign currency exchange rate movements
