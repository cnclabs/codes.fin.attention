cooperative product development the pc industry is characterized by rapid technological advances 
our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace 
our focus is primarily on coordinating and leveraging the development activities of a number of key technology partners  original design manufacturers and product or component providers 
our product development efforts are focused on designing and developing competitively priced pc systems and certain non pc products that adhere to industry standards and incorporate the technologies and features that we believe are most desired by our customers 

table of contents we rely on cooperative relationships with a range of suppliers and other technology developers for engineering  product development and production support in the fulfillment of our desktop and notebook computer and server product lines 
working with these companies  our engineers manage quality  integrate technologies and design product and system architecture 
we believe that these relationships  together with market information obtained from our customer relationships  allow us to rapidly introduce and deliver appealing new products  software and services to the marketplace 
manufacturing gateway s product needs are fulfilled through original design manufacturing and distribution relationships in asia  europe  mexico and the united states to meet the needs of our key market segments 
our manufacturing and distribution supply base operates under gateway specific work instructions and quality metrics to assure product integrity and the functional specifications and quality of the gateway product offering 
in addition  our engineering and quality assurance teams help ensure that our products meet our specifications and applicable regulatory requirements 
to better serve our professional and direct customers  we plan to open a gateway dedicated us final assembly facility in we will assemble configure to order desktops  notebooks and servers according to customer specifications at this facility  as well as provide custom imaging services and government compliance certification 
this new facility is expected to increase our ability to serve our professional and direct customers and improve our cost efficiency

patents  trademarks and licenses gateway  including ad technologies llc formerly known as amiga development llc  have approximately us patents and a number of related foreign patents  and gateway has a significant number of pending us and foreign patent applications 
gateway has a majority equity interest in ad technologies llc  a holding company for intellectual property  controlled by gateway s former chairman of the board 
a majority of the patents in our portfolio were issued in the last five years 
our patent strategy focuses on building a broad portfolio of patents in the areas of computer related and information processing technologies  consumer electronics and manufacturing processes for defensive purposes 
generally  our products incorporate industry standard technology rather than proprietary technology we develop 
trade secrets developed by us are protected through formal procedures that include employee agreements and confidentiality agreements with other entities 
we own and use a number of trademarks  brands and service marks on or in connection with our products and services  including gateway  emachines and our black and white spot design  among others 
many of these trademarks are registered in the united states and other countries  and numerous trademark applications are pending in the united states and other countries 
we believe these trademarks have strong brand name recognition in the united states marketplace and in many countries throughout the world 
we also license technologies and software from third parties for integration into our products 
some of these technologies are industry standard technologies which are licensed by many of our competitors 
in addition  new and existing companies are increasingly engaging in the business of acquiring or developing patents to assert offensively against companies such as us  and some of our direct and indirect competitors seek to license their technology 
as a result  we may incur license costs that our competitors do not incur 
we generally do not own 
table of contents the software used on our pcs and have entered into software licensing arrangements with a number of software developers  including microsoft corporation for windows and microsoft office software products  among others 
software and materials developed by gateway are protected by copyright in the united states and internationally 
competition the pc industry is characterized by a handful of large branded and numerous smaller branded and generic competitors  aggressive pricing  short product life cycles  and price sensitivity by customers 
the level of pricing aggressiveness continues to be intense  particularly in the low price end of the market 
in addition  many of our current and potential partners  including original design manufacturers  design  manufacture and often market their products under their own or third party brand names 
many of our competitors are larger and better funded than we are 
our primary competitors in the pc area are dell inc  hewlett packard company  apple computer inc  lenovo group limited  sony corporation  and toshiba corporation 
in particular regions and outside of the u 
s  we experience competition from companies such as acer inc  fujitsu limited and packard bell 
we also face competition from generically branded or white box manufacturers 
we compete primarily on the basis of customer satisfaction  price  product value  technology  product offerings with innovative performance features  quality  reliability  brand recognition  customer service and support and by maintaining strategic supplier relationships that enable us to bring products to market quickly 
in recent years  we and many of our competitors have regularly lowered prices 
we expect these competitive pressures to continue in and that average sales prices for pcs and non pc products will continue to decline 
environment certain of our operations involve the use of substances regulated under various federal  state and international laws governing the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil  air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
certain of our products are subject to various federal  state and international laws governing chemical substances in products  including those regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design  procurement and operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the composition of our products  including restrictions on the use of lead and other substances in electronics that will apply to products sold in the european union after july  in addition  we are subject to costs and liabilities in connection with product take back legislation in certain jurisdictions that impose financial responsibility on producers of electrical goods for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of covered products 
the liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
gateway currently has an incentive program to encourage our pc customers to recycle or donate their old pcs and monitors  regardless of brand  and we are working with our original design manufacturers and suppliers to reduce the use of hazardous substances in our products 
environmental costs are presently not material to our operations or financial position  however  such costs may become material in the future as compliance obligations continue to increase 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  a reduction from approximately  employees as of december  and from  employees as of december   substantially all of whom are located in the united states 
we believe we have generally good relationships with our employees 

table of contents backlog the backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at year end and approximately million at year end we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be expected for any period 
there can be no assurance that the backlog at any point in time will translate into sales in any subsequent period  particularly in light of our policy  under certain circumstances to allow customers to cancel or reschedule orders 
seasonality retail sales predominantly follow consumer seasonality patterns 
historically revenues in the retail segment are seasonally higher during the second half of the year 
in addition  gateway s professional sales are traditionally stronger in the second and third quarters 
however  these patterns are subject to overall general economic market conditions  large bulk buys and technology transitions

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to other information contained in this annual report  the following factors could affect our future business  results of operations  cash flows or financial position  and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
the pc industry is extremely competitive and pricing pressures have reduced our gross margins and challenge our ability to maintain profitability 
consolidation in the pc industry has resulted in larger and stronger competitors in many of our markets and we continue to experience increased competition in the pc industry in certain of our business segments 
we compete primarily on the basis of customer satisfaction  price  product value  technology  product offerings with innovative performance features  quality  reliability  brand recognition  customer service and support  and by maintaining strategic supplier relationships that enable us to bring products to market quickly 
we expect these competitive pressures to continue into the foreseeable future  including the reduction of average unit prices in retail 
we also expect that average sales prices of our pcs will continue to decline  although this may be partially offset by an increased product mix of relatively higher priced notebook pcs  gateway branded pcs in retail and liquid crystal display monitors 
if we continue to reduce pc prices in response to competition we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins through cost reductions or offsetting sales of higher margin non pc products 
our overall gross margin as a percentage of sales has declined due to our shift in overall distribution to third party retail and competitive pressures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain or grow our revenues and market share and maintain or improve our gross margins  our business prospects and financial condition would be adversely affected 
reliance upon third party patents and intellectual property licensing could limit our ability to innovate and exposes us to actual and potential litigation 
there is no assurance that we will continue to have access to existing or new third party technology for use in our products 
while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods  we believe that based upon past experience and industry practice  such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms 
if we or our suppliers are unable to obtain such licenses  we may be forced to market products without certain desirable technological features 
we could also incur substantial costs to redesign our products around other parties protected technology 
because of technological changes in the pc industry and the convergence of pcs with non pc products  current extensive patent coverage  and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  it is possible certain components of our products and business methods may unknowingly infringe upon existing patents of others 
for example  we are a party to various lawsuits and claims  including assertions of patent infringements and intellectual property related administrative proceedings that arise in connection with our business 
although intellectual property related lawsuits and claims have not historically had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows  we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 
some of these lawsuits allege substantial damages and also seek injunctive relief to stop us from selling products alleged to infringe patents of others 
if such relief was granted or substantial damages were incurred  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  is time consuming  results in significant expenses  and diverts the attention of management and technical personnel 
we attempt to transfer the risk of inadvertent patent infringement to our original design manufacturers and suppliers via contract 
we are not always successful in contractually transferring such risk to our original design manufacturers and suppliers  and even when we do so we may be unable to enforce their obligations or they may be unable to adequately defend any patent infringement claims against our pcs and gateway branded non pc 
table of contents products 
if we are unable to impose upon our original design manufacturers and suppliers the costs of patent infringement claims  our future operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
because one customer accounts for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of this customer would cause a significant decline in our revenues 
a single customer  best buy  accounted for approximately of total revenues for  up from of total revenues for  and is expected to continue to be a significant customer in the future 
although we work to expand and diversify our customer base  reductions or terminations of product purchases by  or pricing pressures from  this customer or other major third party retailers without an offsetting increase in new sales to other customers  would result in a substantial decline in our revenue and operating results 
failure to develop and maintain relationships with several key third party retailers could adversely affect sales 
our products are sold primarily through direct channels and third party retail partners 
third party retail sales have expanded significantly since early we expect a substantial portion of our future sales will be to a small number of key third party retailers 
additionally  third party retailer orders may vary considerably from quarter to quarter 
if the financial condition of these retailers weakens or if they were to cease or significantly reduce the distribution of our products  gateway s business and financial results could be adversely affected 
if significant variability is experienced  gateway s business and financial results for a particular quarter could be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to foster and maintain strategic relationships with these retailers and find a balance between direct sales and third party retail sales could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and operating results 
if we fail to attract new customers  retain our existing customers and or replace revenues associated with our higher margin service revenues  our operating results will be adversely impacted 
the success of our business depends on increasing the overall number of customer transactions in a cost effective manner 
to do this  we must attract new and repeat customers through our various marketing channels  including our website  our telephone call centers  our professional sales force and our third party retail partners  and then convert these interactions into sales transactions 
our reduced marketing expenditures have contributed to reduced demand within our direct and professional segments and our ability to successfully bid on future public sector business could be negatively impacted if we fail to perform under any of our existing public sector contracts 
furthermore  some of our third party retail partners sell or may sell private label pcs at competitive prices 
these sales have the potential to adversely affect our market share 
in addition  a portion of gateway s revenue and profit is derived from higher margin internet access services and extended warranties sold in prior periods and recognized over time under our revenue recognition policy  which we expect to decline in the future 
if we do not achieve increased transaction volume  or replace our higher margin service revenues with alternative sources of profit margin  our ability to grow and maintain profitability will be adversely impacted 
information technology systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations  which could have significant adverse effects on our profitability 
we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system  as well as order capture and customer service applications  and continue to develop and modify certain of our other systems 
we have experienced development and implementation delays with certain projects  and we may experience interruptions in availability of portions of our information technology infrastructure  additional delays in development and implementation  or unanticipated system errors 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems  and transitioning data and other aspects of the process could be expensive  time consuming and disruptive 
any disruptions that may occur in the implementation of these new systems or any future systems could adversely 
table of contents affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner the results of our financial operations and otherwise efficiently operate our business  which could have significant adverse effects on our profitability 
we are dependent on manufacturing and services provided by a limited number of third parties and failure to properly manage these relationships could significantly impact our results of operations 
we are dependent upon third party providers of manufacturing and support services 
we currently outsource all of our manufacturing operations  a significant portion of our service and support functions  and some administrative and operational services to third party providers under contract 
one of the third party providers of service and support functions is partly owned by gateway and controlled by a former executive officer of gateway 
although we have partnered with certain vendors  we have no assurance that business interruptions will not occur or that these third parties will meet the needs of our business 
if we are unable to properly manage our relationships with these third party providers or accurately forecast our demand requirements for them  our revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected 
similarly  if our third party providers do not comply with their contractual obligations  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we require a high volume of quality products and components for our pc and non pc offerings  substantially all of which are obtained from a limited number of original design manufacturers and suppliers 
in some circumstances we maintain single or dual source vendor relationships  such as with microsoft for operating system products and intel and amd for pc microprocessors 
there currently is a lawsuit between amd and intel  the outcome of which could impact our results of operations 
if the supply of a key material product or component were delayed or curtailed  our ability to ship the related product in a timely and cost effective manner could be adversely affected 
we seek to mitigate a portion of these risks in some cases by maintaining insurance to protect ourselves against loss of profits due to a vendor s inability to perform due to an insurable property loss 
in addition  we seek to mitigate such risks by having dual sources of supply where appropriate and by using reputable and reliable vendors 
however  even where multiple vendors are available  we may source from a single vendor to take advantage of volume discounts  for product technical characteristics or quality reasons  or to maintain access to certain key components that are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
in cases where we need to switch to another original design manufacturer or supplier and alternative sources of supply are available  qualification of the sources and establishment of reliable new or additional production with such original design manufacturers or suppliers could result in delays and possible reductions in net sales 
we also receive market development funding from a few of these suppliers 
if the amount of market development funding were to significantly decline  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
to minimize some of these risks  we monitor the financial status of certain key original design manufacturers  suppliers and service providers and assess the likelihood of disruption to the supply of products  components  or services 
certain of our commercial partners currently are financially weak  and we have established contingency plans to mitigate our financial and operating exposure 
however  such plans for any key commercial partner that experiences financial instability may not prevent delays or curtailments of deliveries of key products  components or services  or eliminate our financial exposure to future costs such as warranty claims or the write off of receivables from the re sale of component raw materials to select original design manufacturers  which could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 
in addition  industry consolidation impacts our supply chain and many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same original design manufacturers and suppliers that we utilize 
our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms  more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply  and could limit our ability to engage in relationships with certain original design manufacturers and suppliers 
in addition  certain of our original design manufacturers and suppliers could decide in the future to not continue conducting business with us 
any of these actions by our competitors  original design manufacturers or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our plans to open a final assembly facility exposes us to financial and operational risk 
to better serve our professional and direct customers  we plan to open a gateway dedicated us final assembly facility in we will assemble configure to order desktops  notebooks and servers according to customer specifications at this facility  as well as provide custom imaging services and government compliance certification 
this new facility is expected to increase our ability to serve our professional and direct customers and improve our cost efficiency 
the facility will  however  increase our fixed costs  require us to implement additional systems and controls  and require additional management oversight and expertise 
should any of these costs and requirements escalate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
our reliance on original design manufacturers or suppliers of key products and components exposes us to potential product quality issues and unanticipated warranty costs that could affect the on time delivery and performance of our products and services 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower our product and operating costs  they also reduce our direct control over production and distribution 
if we are unable to ship our products in desired quantities and in a timely manner due to a delay or curtailment of the supply of material products or components  or product quality issues arise due to faulty products or components manufactured by original design manufacturers or suppliers  the market for our products or services could be adversely affected with a resulting reduction in revenues 
our estimated warranty and extended warranty costs are affected by ongoing product failure rates and specific product class failures 
if product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs exceed our estimates due to faulty products or components manufactured by original design manufacturers or suppliers  warranty expenses may increase 
in many instances we rely on offshore suppliers  particularly from asia  for product assembly and manufacturing  and risks associated with transportation  including timely delivery to our primary ports of los angeles and long beach  california  and other natural or human factors may disrupt the flow of product 
if for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations or the subsequent transportation to the us or other customer locations were disrupted by economic  business  environmental  political  medical  military or terrorist events  gateway s operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may experience production and financial difficulties if any of our significant original design manufacturers or suppliers suffer financial instability 
this includes our likely inability to obtain reimbursement for prepaid warranty costs from certain original design manufacturers  should their financial condition deteriorate 
should such original design manufacturers or suppliers fail to either produce or deliver products as scheduled or to provide prepaid warranty coverage  our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
failure to develop and introduce new and technologically advanced products in an industry characterized by short product life cycles could adversely affect our growth and efforts to sustain profitability 
our business model depends on bringing new and innovative products to market quickly 
the success of our product introductions depends on many factors including the availability of new products  successful quality control and launch readiness efforts  our ability to successfully forecast product demand  training of sales and support personnel  and customer acceptance of new technology 
in addition  the introduction of certain new technologies  such as the upcoming microsoft windows vista operating system  presents us with uncertainties regarding the speed of customer acceptance and the related forecasting of customer demand 
if we are unable to successfully forecast demand for new products  we may not properly manage our inventory levels and may have increased exposure to supply shortages  product obsolescence and other supply related risks 
short product life cycles resulting from rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences and declining product prices characterize the pc industry and non pc products 
our internal engineering personnel work closely with product and component suppliers and other technology developers to evaluate the latest developments in pc and non pc products 
there is no assurance that we will continue to have access to or the right to use new technology  or be successful incorporating such new technology in our products in a timely manner 

table of contents the failure to properly manage inventory could result in material losses 
by distributing many of our products directly to our customers prior to our acquisition of emachines  we historically avoided the need to maintain high levels of finished goods inventory 
this minimized costs and allowed us to respond more quickly to changing customer demands and reduced our exposure to the risk of finished product obsolescence 
as we increase sales volume into third party retail channels  managing our inventory effectively has become increasingly important 
third party retailers may quickly increase orders during periods of product shortages  cancel orders if their inventory is too high  or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
orders also may be adjusted in response to the supply of our competitors products and seasonal fluctuations in end user demand 
in addition  we maintain certain component products in inventory 
if we are not successful in forecasting component or product demand  we could have excess or insufficient inventory of certain components or products and any excess inventory may result in reduced prices and inventory write downs  which in turn could result in lower gross margins 
a decrease in market demand or a decision to increase supply  among other factors  could result in higher finished goods and component inventory levels  and a decrease in value of this inventory could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
although we believe our inventory and related reserve provisions are adequate  given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the pc industry  no assurance can be given that we will not incur significant additional inventory and related charges 
in addition  by purchasing component parts on behalf of original design manufacturers  we have increased our credit risk with these original design manufacturers 
the failure to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could have a significant near term adverse impact on our operations 
our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees and maintain employee morale has been adversely impacted by a number of factors  including workforce reductions  the closure of facilities and a competitive pc business environment 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  turnover in senior management and in the general workforce 
most recently  our former chief executive officer resigned on february  and our chairman of the board  richard d 
snyder  assumed the role of interim chief executive officer 
based on past experiences with other companies  these transitions  including the transition from an interim to a permanent chief executive officer  may be a distraction to senior management  business operations  commercial partners and customers 
turnover  particularly among senior management  can also create distractions as we search for replacement personnel  which could result in significant recruiting  relocation  training and other costs  and can cause operational inefficiencies as replacement personnel become familiar with our business and operations 
in addition  manpower in certain areas may be constrained  which could lead to disruptions over time 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully attract or retain the management we need  or be able to maintain an optimal workforce size 
any inability to attract  retain or motivate such personnel or address manpower constraints as needed could materially adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 
we have outsourced operations in countries outside of the us and changes in the political environment  economic policies and other factors within those countries or the us could adversely affect our business 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations to countries in asia and eastern europe and to mexico 
a change in these countries economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in the affected country generally and could negatively impact the cost saving benefits of our outsourced operations overseas 
while our contract obligations are typically in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates could impact our suppliers and increase our prices 
in particular  the recent change in the chinese yuan to united states dollar exchange rate  or any future changes  could increase our costs for products and components sourced from china 
any political instability could also change the present satisfactory legal environment for us through the imposition of restrictions on foreign ownership  repatriation of funds  adverse labor laws  and the like 
further  risks associated with transportation and other natural or human factors  including disease epidemics  may disrupt operations in and the flow of products from certain countries 
we also have outsourced workers in countries outside of the us in technical support call 
table of contents centers  repair centers  and refurbishment centers 
these outsourced operations present us with similar economic and political risks 
the political climate in the us also could change so that it would not be practical for us to use international operational and manufacturing centers 
this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or create low cost operations outside the us environmental laws and regulations and unforeseen costs could impact our future earnings 
production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject gateway to environmental and other regulations 
we also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take back legislation  which provides customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life and places financial and other responsibility for environmentally safe collection  recycling  treatment and disposal with gateway 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement and operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of our products  including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that will apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the european union as of july  restriction of hazardous substances rohs 
the european union has also finalized the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive  which makes producers of electrical goods  including computers and printers  financially responsible for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
there is substantial complexity associated with compliance with these new regulations and the costs of implementation are not easily quantifiable 
compliance also necessitates our reliance on the representations made by suppliers as to material composition  while such representations are believed to be accurate  we could face significant costs and liabilities if the representations prove to not be accurate 
furthermore  we must rely on our suppliers ability to respond to environmental requirements with compliant products and documentation in a timely manner 
similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other states and countries 
other environmental regulations may require gateway to reengineer its products to utilize components which are more environmentally compatible and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to gateway 
although gateway does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of our operations and the effect of such laws  there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on gateway 
with the shift to third party retail  we are increasingly subject to seasonality which can make it difficult to forecast results of operations and anticipate near term developments 
gateway s revenues and operating margins vary among products  distribution channels and the seasonal buying habits of our customers 
historically revenues in the retail segment are seasonally higher during the second half of the year  and professional segment revenues are seasonally higher in the second and third quarters 
consequently  the overall operating margins of gateway in any given period will depend  in part  on the product  geographic and channel mix reflected in that period s net sales  as well as seasonality factors related to the time of the year 
in addition  we typically experience an increase in sales activity near quarter end 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated demand for gateway s products or late arriving components and scheduling production delays at our manufacturing or logistics partners  fluctuations in product  geographic and channel mix  and the effect of seasonality on our sales and operating margins can have significant adverse impacts on gateway and our results of operations and financial condition for a given reporting period 
expansion into international markets exposes us to increased risks 
gateway has expanded sales of pcs and certain non pc products into international markets 
while gateway previously sold pcs in international markets and emachines has been selling in international markets for several years  there can be no assurance that such markets will accept gateway pcs and non pc products to the extent we expect 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  including antidumping penalties  risks in hedging for foreign currency fluctuations for 
table of contents non us dollar sales  difficulties in managing foreign operations  legal remedies that can affect accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  given that our products in international markets are sold primarily through a small number of third party retail partners  gateway s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of any of these retailers weakens or if they were to cease or significantly reduce the distribution of our products 
for those international sales denominated in us dollars  any strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies of other countries into which we sell our products and services could make our products and services more expensive  thereby reducing the price competitiveness of our products 
should any of these difficulties arise  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
war  terrorist acts and other political and economic uncertainties may adversely affect our operating results 
war and the related political and economic uncertainties  terrorist attacks  national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of hostility could materially adversely affect demand for our products and disrupt our supply chain or customer fulfillment logistics or operations  resulting in an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
if we cannot sustain our recent profitability and we incur significant net losses or negative cash flows  the business could fail 
we experienced net losses in the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
while we reported net income of million for the year ended december   approximately million was attributable to the marketing  development and settlement agreement with microsoft  and we cannot guarantee that our profitability will continue 
additional significant net losses would materially adversely affect gateway s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our cash and marketable securities balances have declined since the first quarter of from historically higher levels due to the emachines acquisition  restructuring our company  working capital usage in support of expanding our retail business  and other operating  investing and financing activities 
while our cash and marketable securities balances did not change materially from december  to december   we may be unable to generate positive cash flow  which would result in declining cash and marketable securities balances 
while we believe we will have sufficient cash and financial flexibility to meet our operational cash needs  if we are unable to maintain sufficient liquidity  our future results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
public perception regarding internet security and online privacy could adversely affect our revenues and fraudulent customer activities perpetrated online could result in losses 
customer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of user information may inhibit the growth of our web sales 
to securely transmit confidential information  such as customer credit card numbers  we rely on encryption and authentication technology 
unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data 
furthermore  our information systems infrastructure and that of our service providers may be vulnerable to viruses  other harmful code or harmful activity transmitted over the internet 
while we proactively search and protect against intrusions into our infrastructure  a virus  other harmful code or harmful activity could cause a service disruption 
even though historical losses related to fraudulent customer activities have been minimal  we bear some of the financial risk from products or services purchased through fraudulent payment methods 
we have implemented a number of anti fraud measures  but a failure to adequately control fraudulent methods of payment could adversely affect our operations and financial results 

table of contents failure to accurately estimate and monitor our rebate redemption rates could significantly impact results of operations 
from time to time we offer product rebates on purchases of certain of our pcs and non pc products 
we use historical data to assist us in determining the percentage of customers who will claim these product rebates 
we must estimate future product rebate redemptions to price our products effectively 
if we experience an unexpected increase in rebate redemption rates  then the effective average selling price of our products would be reduced below the level we anticipated and our net revenues and gross margins would decline  thereby adversely impacting our results of operations 
further  to the extent customers do not cash product rebate checks  we could be liable to pay unclaimed funds to certain states  including amounts attributable to prior periods 
a substantial portion of our services and support offerings  including customer care  is provided by third party service providers and we could experience additional costs and or declines in customer satisfaction levels if we are unable to properly monitor and manage such providers 
we have consolidated our service and support providers and rely on such providers to supply warranty repairs and other support offerings  including customer and tech support services  to our customers 
while such providers are required to maintain certain service levels  there can be no guarantee that such companies will provide our customers with the same high level of service we otherwise would provide ourselves  which could result in additional corrective costs  lower customer satisfaction levels and declines in customer demand 
if we do not maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition  we may lose customers which would adversely impact our financial results 
developing and maintaining awareness of our gateway and emachines brand names is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our pc and non pc offerings 
promotion and enhancement of our brand will depend largely on whether we cost effectively provide reliable and desirable products and services to customers and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts 
currently  third party retailers are often our first points of contact with consumers and these retailers provide much of our product advertising as we have reduced our internal spending on marketing 
if these retailers reduce or cease advertising our products  we may need to increase our own sales and marketing expenses to create and maintain brand awareness among potential consumers 
if customers do not perceive our products to be of high quality  our brand names and reputation could be harmed  which could adversely impact our financial results 
recent changes in accounting for equity compensation will adversely affect earnings and could affect our ability to attract and retain key employees 
historically  we have used stock options as a component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with those of our stockholders  encourage retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas number r  which requires companies to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants and other equity incentives  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  although we accelerated the vesting of all stock options that had exercise prices in excess of the market price on october   because these options did not provide sufficient incentive to our employees when compared with the potential future compensation expense that would have been attributable to these options  we expect that equity compensation will continue to be a component of our total compensation program 
the accounting treatment for outstanding unvested equity awards will affect our future earnings and could limit gateway s willingness to use equity based compensation plans  which could affect our ability to attract and retain employees

since the acquisition of emachines on march   we have completely overhauled the distribution of our products to consumers and have significantly reduced our sg a cost structure 
we manage our business through our three major business segments direct  professional and retail which includes our international segment 
our strengths include our strong brand name recognition  our value based product lines  and our ability to maneuver quickly and react to product development trends in the rapidly changing pc industry 
some of the key developments and achievements for include net income we posted net income of million or per share for the year ended december   after the effect of two significant  one time charges for the february hewlett packard agreement million and increasing a reserve for a sales  income  and franchise tax dispute related to prior years million  following four consecutive years of net losses 
continued cost structure improvements sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to in from including percentage points attributable to restructuring  transformation and integration charges in we believe that one of the keys to achieving sustainable profitability is to 
table of contents focus on cost levels and overall efficiency in our operation 
continued cost reductions are designed to allow us to leverage our low overhead structure to achieve growth across our business segments by providing excellent products with great value 
despite continued price and gross margin pressures  we believe our improved cost structure will provide significant operating leverage going forward if we achieve continued revenue growth 
notebook and monitor sales growth in  we experienced sales momentum with our notebook products and flat panel liquid crystal display lcd monitors 
notebook unit sales were up in compared with and lcd sales were up over sales 
continued retail and international expansion in january  we introduced our gateway branded products into more than circuit city retail stores in the united states 
in july  we also added staples locations 
retail partners in japan  the united kingdom  mexico and france were also added during gateway and emachines products are now sold in more than  third party retail stores throughout the united states and canada and in more than  international retail locations  including japan  mexico  the united kingdom and france 
overall net sales for the retail segment increased in compared with based on the most recent estimates by the npd group  gateway s us retail desktop market share increased from to and us retail market share for notebooks increased from to 
significant professional segment wins while net sales and market share have declined within the professional segment on a year over year basis and gross margins have been under pressure  we have achieved significant professional segment contract wins in the current year  including the us navy and air force  the state of california and the university of arizona 
such wins do not necessarily represent guaranteed revenue and in some cases are dependent upon governmental budget appropriations 
gateway continues to focus on sales of services  software and peripherals to professional customers to achieve satisfactory gross margins and to emphasize responsiveness to the professional market in terms of quality  service and spare parts availability 
new products in  we announced several innovative  new products  including  our next generation convertible notebook  a inch wide lcd monitor and our quiet and cool running mini btx desktop 
the convertible notebook features the power and mobility of a notebook combined with the flexibility and creativity of a tablet 
the new convertible notebook was launched simultaneously through all our channels 
we supported the launch of the convertible notebook with a comprehensive  brand building advertising campaign that is designed to highlight the features of this innovative product and demonstrate its appeal to small businesses and educators as well as consumers 
in january  we announced our refreshed notebook line that features performance enhancements  thin and lightweight designs  long battery life  and advanced data  theft and internet security 
this new line is intended to appeal to professionals  small businesses and consumers alike 
microsoft agreement in april  we entered into a marketing  development and settlement agreement with microsoft that provides for an aggregate of million including million paid directly to our outside legal counsel in quarterly cash payments to us through as part of the agreement  we are required to use the remaining million to fund various marketing and promotional initiatives  including advertising  sales training and consulting  as well as the research  development  and testing of new gateway products that run microsoft products 
we also released microsoft from certain anti trust claims as part of this agreement 
benefits received under this arrangement are recognized upon the later of qualifying spend or cash receipt 
in  we received and recognized million 
per the agreement  we expect to receive million quarterly through the end of we continue to face a variety of challenges and opportunities inherent within the pc industry which is characterized by rapid change  evolving customer demands and intense competition 
key challenges include focus on increasing demand for our products in a highly competitive market  increasing revenue  lowering costs

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a discussion of gateway s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and gateway s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires gateway s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gateway s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of gateway s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition gateway recognizes revenue on pcs  servers and non pc products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from training services  previously offered through our store network  was recognized as the services were provided 
revenue from internet services provided by third parties is recognized as the services are provided based on subscriber counts reported to us by the service providers 
if the actual subscriber counts or the economics associated with these subscriber counts prove to be more or less than originally reported by the service providers  we may be required to adjust revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  america online  inc aol unilaterally recomputed payments it had made in and the first half of and withheld the claimed overpayments from amounts currently owed to us 
we disputed aol s retroactive adjustment and reached a settlement in november for million related to the contested period and an additional million for subsequent periods through this was recognized as revenue in revenue from the sale of other services rendered by third parties  such as installation services  is generally recognized when such services are performed 
gateway offers its customers an option to purchase extended warranties 
revenue related to sales of extended warranties sold on behalf of third parties is recognized at the time of sale  net of amounts due to the third party 
revenue from sales of extended warranties where gateway is the legal obligor is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the warranty service period 
gateway records reductions in revenue in the current period for estimated future product returns and estimated rebate redemption rates related to current period sales 
management analyzes historical returns  current trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowances in any accounting period 
management also analyzes historical rebate redemption rates  current trends and the interrelationship of these rates with the current rebate dollar amounts in evaluating rebate allowances 
if actual returns exceed estimated returns or if actual rebate redemptions exceed estimates  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
gateway also records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to other customer and sales incentive programs 
this includes  among other things  trade ins and referral credits 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to increase customer incentive programs that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts gateway maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the creditworthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
we record an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
we also record an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of our customers  and the aging of such receivables 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition or we become aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation the business environment in which gateway operates is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we record write downs for components and products which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform an assessment of inventory each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  inventory on hand and forecast requirements  product life cycle including end of life product and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record an adjustment for excess and obsolete inventory 
gateway may be required to record additional write downs if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from estimates  which would affect earnings in the period the write downs are made 
receivables from suppliers gateway purchases selected raw materials from component suppliers and resells the raw materials to original design manufacturers to incorporate into products being manufactured for gateway 
the receivable from these sales of the raw materials is recorded as receivables from suppliers where gateway does not have the contractual right to offset the receivable against a related payable 
if substantial uncertainty regarding the collectibility of these receivables is noted  an appropriate reserve may be required  which would affect earnings in the period the uncertainty is identified 
internal use software gateway capitalizes only those direct costs associated with the actual development or acquisition of computer software for internal use  including costs associated with the design  coding  installation and testing of the system 
costs associated with preliminary development  such as the evaluation and selection of alternatives  as well as training  maintenance and support are expensed as incurred 
gateway is currently migrating to a new enterprise resource planning system as well as new order capture and back end service and support systems 
a significant change to the planned use of internal use software could result in a material impairment charge or a change in the estimated depreciable life which could result in increased depreciation expense in the reporting period that the change was made 
warranty provision gateway provides standard warranties with the sale of products 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of suppliers 
estimated warranty costs are affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of experience and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or in providing customer support 
if actual product failure 
table of contents rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
restructuring gateway has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require our management to make significant estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation and other exit costs  and estimates of future rental income that may be generated through the subleasing of excess facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
long lived asset impairments gateway reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires management to make assumptions and estimates related to estimated future cash flows to be generated and used by an asset or asset group as well as the expected or future use of such assets and or their estimated future useful lives 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used and a significant change to the planned use of an asset or asset group could result in a change of the useful life in a given reporting period 
taxes on earnings gateway records a tax provision or benefit for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
the provision for benefit from income taxes is computed using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our ability to carryback historical losses  cumulative losses in recent years  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized  our valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
gateway expects to maintain a full valuation allowance on potential future tax benefits and generally to record no tax benefit until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained 
litigation gateway is currently involved in certain legal proceedings see note to the consolidated financial statements 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or governmental proceedings and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated within a range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim if there is no best estimate in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the legal proceedings and revise those estimates 
revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
non amortized intangible assets including goodwill on march   gateway acquired emachines  a privately held pc company  in a transaction valued at approximately million 
the acquisition combined gateway s professional and consumer now called direct businesses  scale and cash availability with emachines low cost structure  profitability  pc market strength  third party retail network  and international presence 
these factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of emachines net tangible and intangible assets acquired and  as a result  gateway recorded goodwill of million 
gateway also recorded million in intangible assets related to the 
table of contents emachines tradename 
these intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate an event of impairment may have occurred or exist 
our fourth quarter review process utilizes multiple methods including the income method  to estimate fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that relies on estimates about gateway s future revenues based on assumed market segment growth rates and costs  discounted at appropriate rates based on gateway s weighted average cost of capital 
future revenue and cost estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
our fourth quarter of assessment supported the conclusion that no non amortized intangible asset  including goodwill  impairment existed as of december  a significant change in our retail business would result in a material impairment of these assets 
microsoft agreement gateway receives funding on a quarterly basis through from microsoft under a marketing  development and settlement agreement the agreement 
the agreement requires that we use a substantial majority of the million proceeds to fund various marketing and promotional initiatives  including advertising  sales training and consulting  as well as the research  development and testing of new gateway products that run microsoft products and releases microsoft from all antitrust claims gateway had made 
although the agreement contains future marketing and development as well as historical legal components  the relative fair value of these components could not be comprehensively determined 
as a result  these two components were not bifurcated for purposes of income statement presentation 
we recognize the funding received under this arrangement as a reduction of operating expenses under the line item microsoft benefit upon the later of qualifying spend or cash receipt 
if the company fails to incur sufficient qualifying spend or if microsoft fails to fund such spend on a timely basis  this could result in a material adverse impact to the financial results because gateway would not be able to record the benefit

see segment performance below for further discussion of unit and net sales performance on a segment basis 
vs 
the increases in net sales and pc unit shipments are primarily due to the contribution of emachines pc unit sales subsequent to march  and expansion of the availability of gateway products into third party retail offset by declines in gateway pc sales resulting from the closure of our retail stores on april  the stores previously contributed  on average  approximately million in net sales per quarter 
during the second half of  we greatly expanded the availability of gateway products through third party retail partners and expanded the availability of both gateway and emachines products internationally 
unit sales growth significantly outpaced net sales growth due to the lower average selling price on emachines pcs as compared with gateway pcs  with overall average selling prices declining to in compared to  in assuming the acquisition of emachines had occurred on january   pro forma net sales for would have been billion as compared with billion of pro forma net sales in see note to the financial statements

the agreement is still subject to review of the joint committee on taxation 
gateway believes the review of the joint committee will not adversely impact the recognition of the benefit recorded for this agreement 
segment performance during the second quarter of and in connection with the acquisition of emachines  we formed a new operating segment  retail  and realigned our historical operating segments  direct previously consumer and professional 
management also realigned the methodology used to allocate certain corporate overhead expenses to the operating segments 
our segment sales and operations are delineated by operating segment as follows direct includes consumer and small business sales generated via gateway s web and phone centers as well as the contribution of gateway retail stores through their date of closing on april  and certain ongoing revenue streams therefrom  professional includes sales to customers in education k and higher education  government federal  state and local  medium to large business and third party resellers  retail includes sales through third party retail channels  including emachines branded products subsequent to the emachines acquisition in march  gateway branded products sold at retail beginning in the third quarter of  and gateway only sales to certain third party channel customers in international includes international sales and is currently aggregated within the retail segment for external reporting purposes as it meets the aggregation criteria of sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
revenues from these segments are derived from sales of pc and non pc products and services 
we evaluate segment performance based on sales and operating income loss  and do not include segment assets or other income and expense items for management reporting purposes 
segment operating income loss includes selling  general and administrative expenses and other overhead charges directly attributable to the segment and excludes expenses managed outside the reporting segment  including corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  the microsoft benefit  depreciation and amortization  and the restructuring  transformation and integration charges discussed in restructuring activities above
