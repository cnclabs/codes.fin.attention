item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual events and or future results of operations may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements  as a result of the factors described here  and in the documents incorporated herein by reference  including  those factors described under risk factors overview we are a leading provider of business to business sales and marketing services  leveraging integrated telesales  marketing  web technologies  and data analytics to achieve higher revenue for clients 
our core activities include lead qualification and nurturing management  lead generation for product sales  subscription and service contract sales  and contract renewals and warranty extension sales 
our services are available individually or as an integrated solution 
our two primary product offerings of service contract sales and lead generation share the same business strategy for our clients of marketing and selling their products and services to their business customers 
we provide our service contract telesales offerings primarily under pay for performance arrangements in which our revenue is based on our ability to sell our clients products and services to their customers 
lead generation projects typically are sold at a fixed rate  with marketing and other services being billed on a time and materials basis 
accordingly  if a particular client s products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of the client s products and services may decline 
our clients can also purchase complementary services  such as additional database management and supplementary marketing programs  on a fee basis 
new clients may require us to make up front investments  including hiring additional staff and creating the necessary infrastructure to deliver our services 
these costs are typically incurred some time before significant revenue is generated 
we may charge for certain of these costs  however  these costs could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and operating results  depending on market acceptance of new service combinations and pricing options 
our quarterly and annual operating results may continue to fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including but not limited to the continued demand for outsourced services  market conditions in the industries in which we operate and our ability to execute our business strategy 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our historical revenue has tended to fluctuate based on seasonal buying patterns of our clients and their customers 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by technology companies  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to our revenues  asset impairments  restructuring charges  income taxes and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and they have reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k a for the fiscal year ended december   except for the newly applicable accounting policies and estimates relating to our acquisition of sunset direct in february and our asset purchase with launch project  llc  including those relating to the allocation of purchase price and the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and presentation policies  valuation of accounts receivable  and the assessment of recoverability and measuring impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  and fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices  however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentations substantially all of our revenues are generated from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals  and performance of lead generation services 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our client s service contracts and maintenance renewals under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and on the net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from the client s customer is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  
table of contents and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead generation services we perform is recognized as the services are accepted and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead generation service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
revenue from service sales activities is recognized once these services have been delivered 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment of the product directly to the client s customer and has been historically an insignificant percentage of our net revenue 
we generally do not enter into multiple element revenue arrangements with our clients or customers 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified our direct costs associated with promoting and selling our clients products and services from sales and marketing expense to costs of services 
sales and marketing expenses now primarily represent our corporate sales and marketing efforts to secure new clients 
this change in presentation has been made for all financial periods presented herein 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and december   our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for website development costs 
sop and eitf require that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of sop and eitf have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs  are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific outsource client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 

table of contents during late and throughout  we have been developing a replacement for our existing system to identify potential service sales opportunities  track the sales contacts and process the sale of the service contracts 
as of december   we had invested million in the new order entry system including  in capitalized interest costs 
we currently expect to deploy and begin depreciating the new order entry system in the second quarter of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we will perform the impairment test for the goodwill generated by the sunset direct acquisition in the first quarter of to date  no circumstances or indicators have arisen to indicate that the carrying value has been impaired 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement no 
 long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
the company has identified its reporting units as service sales and lead generation 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill

the termination or non renewal of outsource agreements with any one of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

 accounting for stock based compensation and generally requires the cost associated with employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced a new rule allowing companies to implement statement no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june   or december  for small business issuers 
in accordance with that rule  we will comply with statement no 
r beginning with the interim financial statements for the first quarter of  filed with the securities and exchange commission 
statement no 
r applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at a company s adoption date 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards and the transition methods modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we expect that the adoption of this standard will increase our net loss and loss per share  however it will have no impact on cash flow 
we estimate that the compensation expense related to stock options will be between  and  on december   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded to the company s employees  officers and its directors under the company s stock option plan 
as a result  these fully vested options will not have to be expensed in future periods which was the primary purpose for this action

sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions to eliminate certain exceptions to the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments that mature in less than days 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our two term loans and our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime lending rate at 
table of contents december  
maturity dates on these loans range from december to may at december   we had million of debt outstanding under these loans 
based on the funding dates for these loans and payments made during  we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in  in additional interest expense for the year ended december  due to the our debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management  should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
at december   the interest rates on all of our outstanding capital leases are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rates on our debt are at a variable rate of prime plus per annum
