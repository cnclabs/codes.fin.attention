overview and outlook business environment overview lydall designs and manufactures specialty engineered automotive thermal and acoustical barriers  passive and active industrial thermal and insulating solutions  filtration media  medical filtration media  devices and biopharmaceutical processing components for demanding thermal acoustical and filtration separation applications 
lydall s thermal acoustical and filtration separation businesses are in markets that present growth opportunities and we expect the businesses to grow over the long term  primarily through the introduction of new products  expansion of share in existing markets and penetration of new markets 
as many of lydall s operations conduct business on a worldwide basis  lydall s results can be impacted by global  regional and industry economic and political factors 
the global automotive industry is sensitive to changes in certain economic and competitive conditions 
based upon market information  our customers  particularly the big domestic automotive manufacturers  are currently experiencing the impact of these conditions  which could continue to adversely affect vehicle production volumes 
while the company experienced approximately percent growth in global automotive net sales in  as compared to  a continued reduction in vehicle production volumes  or a major decline in the production of specific vehicles in which lydall has significant content could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability in future quarters 

table of contents current environmental and economic conditions could also impact lydall s business segments 
significant increases in energy costs  as well as increases in raw material pricing  specifically  aluminum used in most of the company s heat shield products and various fibers used in thermal acoustical as well as filtration separation products  could increase manufacturing costs  and the company may not have the ability to pass some or all of these incremental costs on to its customers 
during  the company experienced a decline in sales in the filtration separation business 
filtration media used in clean room applications declined as the construction of clean rooms decreased compared with the company also experienced a decline in sales of certain other air filtration media related to market pricing competition during compared with while such pricing competition may continue into  we expect our market share to stabilize 
the company substantially completed the restructuring and consolidation of its domestic automotive manufacturing operations as of december  the total costs related to the restructuring effort recorded through december  were million  with approximately million being incurred during the company does not expect to incur any future material costs associated with this restructuring 
the cost savings related to this restructuring plan have not been substantial through december  compared with the previous operating costs of the domestic automotive business 
although the company believes there has been a favorable reallocation of costs to other operational efforts and that the company is responding to market demands more effectively  the benefits of maximizing production capacity utilization have had minimal positive impact on operating margins to date 
this is primarily due to higher than originally planned costs incurred to expand operations and production lines to absorb the consolidation of the columbus operation and higher than expected costs to integrate processes at the two remaining locations that were realigned during this process 
the restructuring activities  along with the expected improved efficiencies from the integrated processes  as well as the effects of lean manufacturing and other cost saving initiatives unrelated to the restructuring  are anticipated to lead to improvement in gross margin and operating income  however  the timing and extent of such improvements are not quantifiable at this time 
the st 
nazaire  france automotive facility is strategically located to complement the company s operations in germany and support the company s long term growth strategy in europe by enabling lydall to service all major european automotive manufacturers 
during  the facility began to provide much needed relief to the overcapacity issues that the automotive operation in germany had been experiencing for some time 
the transfer of production of certain parts began in the second quarter of and the platforms scheduled to be transferred from germany were completed and were in production at the facility as of the end of the first quarter of during  the operation in germany demonstrated improvement in lowering production costs due to the transition of business to the st 
nazaire operation 
additionally  the st 
nazaire operation was profitable during  as compared with operating losses that were incurred for the improvement in performance at the st 
nazaire facility is expected to continue as the operation continues to increase overall capacity utilization and expand production 
similar to other public companies  the on going compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act required the company to devote internal resources and incur substantial external costs related to the use of consultants and for increased audit fees 
the company incurred approximately million in and million in in external consulting and audit costs related to this initiative 
although the costs declined from levels and are expected to further decline in  the external costs are expected to continue to have a material impact on the results of operations and cash flows going forward 
in january  the charter medical  ltd 
subsidiary of lydall announced a voluntary product recall of certain of its blood transfer and storage products upon the discovery of procedural deficiencies in the sterilization validation process 
neither the company nor charter medical has been notified of any adverse events or reports from customers with regard to these products 
the company resumed shipment of these products during the third quarter of the company estimated the cost of the recall and resultant corrective actions to be approximately million to million and the company accrued million related to this matter during the fourth quarter of as of december   the actual costs incurred continue to be in line with the original estimate 
the reduction in net sales for the year related to the product recall and the time that was required to validate the sterilization process was approximately million 
the company recently announced the company wide launch of lean six sigma 
as a result  several programs are underway to target profitability improvement throughout the company  including initiatives to reduce costs  promote sales growth and improve efficiencies 
as this process continues  the company anticipates that these efforts will identify ways to improve processes and work flow  reduce costs and leverage synergies across the organization 
however  the company cannot determine the timing and impact of these initiatives at this time 

table of contents consolidated results of operations net sales in thousands of dollars net sales the increase in net sales in of million or percent  compared with  was primarily the result of increased sales from the automotive businesses of million  partially offset by a decrease in sales in the filtration separation segment of million 
foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on net sales in the increase in automotive sales occurred at both the domestic and european automotive businesses 
the decrease in the filtration separation segment was primarily attributable to a million decrease in filtration sales and a million decrease in sales of vital fluids products 
in  net sales increased by million  or percent  compared to foreign currency translation  which was primarily related to the continued strengthening of the euro during  increased net sales by approximately percent 
after adjusting for foreign currency translation  net sales growth was attributable to sales improvements in the automotive  air filtration and industrial thermal businesses 
additionally  increased sales of blood transfusion and cell therapy products contributed to the overall sales improvement 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of vital fluids traditional blood filtration materials and products for bioprocessing applications and a reduction in revenues from the trucking operations of the transport business 
gross margin in thousands of dollars gross margin percentage of sales the improvement in gross margin percentage in to percent from percent in was due to the absence of certain charges that had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percentage 
restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the domestic automotive facilities and the negative gross margin performance related to the start up activity of the automotive operation in france  reduced the gross margin percentage from percent to percent 
after excluding these charges from results  the gross margin percentage in decreased by percentage points compared to the decrement in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and the resultant of higher per unit manufacturing costs in the filtration business 
there were several contributing factors to the reduction in gross margin percentage in to percent compared with percent costs incurred associated with the restructuring of the domestic automotive operations  start up gross margin performance of the st 
nazaire automotive operations  production inefficiencies at the domestic and german automotive operations  and production inefficiencies and the cost of the product recall at the vital fluids operations 
these negative impacts were partially offset by improved gross margin contribution from the air and liquid filtration  industrial thermal and transport businesses 
selling  product development and administrative expenses in thousands of dollars selling  product development and administrative expenses percentage of sales the decrease in selling  product development and administrative expenses of million in  compared to  was primarily due to lower costs in related to sarbanes oxley section compliance of million and lower legal costs associated with litigation against a former employee of million in  offset by million recorded in related to the elimination of the chief operating officer position and increases in salaries and commissions of million 
in addition  the company made investments in product development of million in  compared with million in excluding the sarbanes oxley section compliance costs  legal fees associated with a former employee and costs related to the elimination of the chief operating officer position  in the respective periods  selling  product development and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for was essentially the same as for 
table of contents the primary drivers of the increase in selling  product development and administrative costs and as a percentage of net sales  compared to  were increased costs related to sarbanes oxley section compliance of million  increased legal costs associated with litigation against a former employee and the investigation of allegations made by this former employee of million  and increased bonus expense of million 
in addition  the company made investments in product development and sales and marketing efforts  increasing spending in these areas by approximately percent and percent  respectively  compared with levels 
these cost increases were partially offset by cost savings achieved by the elimination of the operating group structure in additionally  charges of approximately million were incurred in for the consolidation of the company s e commerce function  outside professional fees related to the investigation at the columbus operation  severance related to the elimination of the group structure and fees for tax projects and retained searches  which did not recur during restructuring activities in thousands of dollars severance and related costs accelerated depreciation facility exit and move costs total costs incurred during the year ended december  costs incurred during the year ended december  costs incurred during the year ended december  total pre tax costs for the restructuring program by type as part of a strategic evaluation initiated in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a plan to maximize production capacity utilization  reallocate administrative costs to more beneficial operational efforts and more effectively respond to market demands for increasingly faster  technologically advanced cost effective solutions 
as a result  the company consolidated the operations of the columbus manufacturing operation into existing lydall facilities 
the company substantially completed the restructuring and consolidation of its domestic automotive manufacturing operations as of december  the total costs related to the restructuring effort recorded through december  were approximately million  with approximately million being incurred during additionally  during december the company recorded an after tax charge of approximately million related to the write off of state deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized as a result of the restructuring 
approximately percent of all restructuring costs incurred were recorded in cost of sales and percent were recorded in selling  product development and administrative expenses 
approximately percent of restructuring costs were recorded in the thermal acoustical segment and percent were recorded as corporate office expenses  which for segment reporting purposes are included under reconciling items 
the company does not expect to incur any future material costs associated with this restructuring 
the cost savings related to this restructuring plan have not been substantial through december  compared with the previous operating costs of the domestic automotive business 
although the company believes there has been a favorable reallocation of costs to other operational efforts and that the company is responding to market demands more effectively  the benefits of maximizing production capacity utilization have had minimal positive impact on operating margins to date

interest expense in thousands of dollars interest expense weighted average interest rate during the year the increase in interest expense during  and was primarily related to correspondingly higher average debt levels in each sequential year combined with higher interest rates 

table of contents other income and expense in thousands of dollars other income and expense  net for the year ended december   other income and expense  net consists primarily of income of approximately million related to the reversal of an environmental accrual connected with previously divested facilities in germany 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company determined that it was no longer probable  but remote  that the company would incur any environmental remediation expense related to the divested facilities 
the remaining amounts included in other income and expense are primarily related to investment income and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
income taxes effective income tax rate the effective tax rates for and were impacted favorably by benefits derived from the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions as well as tax exempt export income 
the effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the completion of a tax audit at one of our foreign locations  adjustments for foreign taxes and benefits recognized on certain state credits and state loss carryforwards 
the and effective rates were negatively impacted by certain state franchise and alternative taxes  which do not directly fluctuate with the level of income 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets for state income tax credits and net operating losses primarily related to the closure of the columbus  ohio facility 
for  the company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately to percent 
the company s federal income tax return is currently being examined by the irs 
this examination is expected to conclude in adjustments  if any  from the completion of this audit could have an impact on the effective tax rate 
in  the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law by the president of the united states 
this act provided for a phase out of the extraterritorial income program eti as provided for in the united states internal revenue code and also allows for certain tax benefits for us manufacturers that are intended to offset the eti phase out 
during and  the eti benefit decreased the company s effective tax rate by approximately and percentage points  respectively 
at this time  the company is unable to determine the exact impact that the eti phase out and implementation of the manufacturer benefit system will have on future financial results  however  it is not expected that such changes will have a material impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows in future periods

this interpretation clarified the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligations are conditional on 
table of contents a future event 
fin requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the company determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of the company s owned and leased facilities related primarily to building materials and leasehold improvements 
the company adopted fin on october   which resulted in a non cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge to the results of operations of approximately million  net of income taxes  and a liability for conditional asset retirement obligations of approximately million 
in february  the company s board of directors adopted a plan to discontinue the operations of the paperboard segment  consisting principally of the southern products and lydall foulds operations 
accordingly  the operating results of this discontinued segment were segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share for additional shutdown costs and the write off of the remaining book value of these assets

the company is also benefiting from a strengthening collaboration between our european and domestic operations 
this dynamic is enabling the company to work with customers on a much broader basis  resulting in increased business with european transplants in the united states 
sales from the industrial thermal businesses increased by less than million in 
table of contents compared with the prior year 
modest increases in sales of affinity temperature control active thermal products were partially offset by sales declines in passive thermal products such as building material products used principally in heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac applications 
net sales for the thermal acoustical segment for increased by million  or percent  compared to the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment net sales by approximately percent for after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency  sales growth during the year was attributable to increased sales in the automotive business  continued improvement in sales of active thermal products and increased sales of passive thermal products 
sales to the automotive industry accounted for approximately percent of segment net sales in and increased approximately percent on a constant currency basis from the increase in automotive sales was primarily related to new product launches domestically and in europe and increased tooling sales related to these products and future production program launches 
additionally  the new st 
nazaire facility added incremental sales volume during industrial thermal products accounted for approximately percent of segment net sales in sales of industrial thermal products  which include both passive and active systems  showed strong growth during  increasing by percent from sales levels 
active thermal products sold under the affinity product line had record sales performance in with an overall increase of approximately percent from related to strong sales to the semiconductor market 
sales of passive insulating products used in building and appliance applications also showed solid improvement in  with sales to the appliance market increasing by approximately percent and sales of materials used in building products improving by approximately percent from levels 
segment operating income and operating margin percentage in increased by million and percentage points  respectively  compared to a significant portion of these increases were due to the absence of certain charges that had an unfavorable impact on operating income and operating margin percentage 
restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the domestic automotive facilities and operating losses due to start up activity of the automotive operation in france  reduced operating income by million 
after excluding these charges from results  operating income in increased by million  or percent and operating margin percentage increased by percentage points compared to the increases in operating income and operating margin percentage were primarily the result of the european automotive operation s significant improvements in overall profitability in with the transfer of business from the german operation to the st 
nazaire facility 
this translated into improved absorption of overall costs in france and the elimination of certain incremental costs at the operation in germany 
operating income of the industrial thermal businesses declined by million in compared with primarily related to changes in product mix at the passive and active thermal businesses 
for  segment operating income was million compared with million in the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment operating income by approximately percent for the declines in segment operating income and margin primarily related to domestic restructuring charges recorded of million  full year start up performance of the st 
nazaire operations  which had increased operating losses of approximately million during compared with  and lower operating performance of million primarily related to production inefficiencies of the domestic automotive operations caused by disruptions related to the transfer of production to other plants as part of the domestic restructuring program  overcapacity challenges and related production inefficiencies at the german operation  and new product launch issues during the year at the st 
johnsbury operation 
these declines were partially offset by improved operating income from higher sales of the industrial thermal business of approximately million and cost savings from the elimination of the group structure at the end of filtration separation segment net sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to the prior year 
the impact of foreign currency translation was minimal on segment net sales for the decrease was related to substantially lower sales of filtration media and vital fluids products of million and million  respectively  compared with the decline in filtration media was related to reductions in sales of air filtration media used in clean room filtration applications as a result of reduced clean room builds in asia compared with levels 
in addition  sales of other air filtration media decreased due to pricing competition in certain markets 
vital fluids sales decreased due to lower sales of blood transfusion and cell therapy products of million  lower bio processing products sales of million  and lower sales of traditional oem products of million 
the decrease in blood related product sales is related to the product recall previously disclosed  delays in the resumption of shipping of these products due to the validation of the sterilization process and the phase out of certain other blood related products 
the reduction in bio processing sales was primarily related to the change in sales philosophy for these products in prior years from a direct sales approach to external distributors 
this move proved ineffective and the company has moved back to a direct sales force approach 

table of contents in  filtration separation segment net sales increased million  or percent  compared to the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment net sales by approximately percent for after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency  the increase in segment net sales from levels was related to stronger sales of air filtration media  higher sales of blood transfusion and cell therapy products and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of liquid filtration materials 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of traditional blood filtration materials sold to medical device manufacturers and a reduction in sales of products for bioprocessing applications 
sales from the air filtration businesses in the united states and europe were substantially higher during specifically related to increased orders for cleanroom projects in asia 
sales of liquid filtration products increased modestly from as water filtration and industrial fluid filtration products  sold under the actipure and lypore trademarks  continued to have sustained growth and acceptance in consumer and industrial applications 
sales of vital fluids products decreased approximately percent for compared with this decrease was related to the decline in sales of traditional blood filtration materials sold to original equipment manufacturers as these markets continued an expected decline that began in late  as well as a decrease in sales of products for bioprocessing applications 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in blood transfusion and cell therapy products sales related to launches of new platelet sampling products during segment operating income in decreased by million  or percent  from and operating margin percentage decreased to percent in from percent in the prior year 
these declines were substantially related to lower sales of filtration media and vital fluids products and the corresponding reduction in gross margin contribution 
exacerbating this sales volume impact was the under absorption of manufacturing costs related to the reduced production runs during the period  resulting in higher per unit product costs 
the operating loss for the vital fluids business was million greater in compared to a small operating loss in segment operating income for increased million  or percent  compared with segment operating margin as a percent of segment net sales also increased to percent in from percent in the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment operating income by approximately percent for the improvements in segment operating income and margin related to improved margin performance of the air filtration businesses through higher sales volume  cost reductions and improved absorption of overhead costs and margin contribution increases from blood transfusion and cell therapy products due to higher sales volumes 
these increases in operating income were partially offset by lower margin performance of traditional blood filtration products due to continued lower sales volumes 
additionally  a nonrecurring charge of million was recorded by the vital fluids operations in december related to a product recall of certain blood transfer and storage products 
nonrecurring charges for severance associated with the elimination of the group organizational structure and costs related to the consolidation of the vital fluids operations had a negative impact on operating income and margin for other products and services the increase in net sales from ops of million in was primarily related to increased revenue for the trucking operations of the transport business of million  partially offset by decreased specialty product sales of million 
the increase in the transport business relates to increased business volume from certain customers and price increases 
although net sales of ops were relatively flat with  within these businesses  increased sales of specialty products and higher revenues from the warehousing operations of the transport business were substantially offset by a decrease in revenues from the trucking operations of the transport business 
the increased performance from the warehousing operations was related to its growth and expanded capacity levels 
the decline in revenues from the trucking operations was primarily the result of a customer rationalization program 
operating income from ops decreased by million for compared with the prior year 
operating margin percentage was percent of net sales in compared with percent in these decreases were primarily the result of product mix and higher than expected warehousing costs in compared to operating income from ops increased million  or percent in compared to operating margin was percent of net sales in compared with percent in the increase in operating income and margin primarily related to the trucking and warehousing operations of the transport business 
these gains were a result of the trucking operations customer rationalization program and the warehousing operations expanded operations and service levels  which were both achieved while holding overall administrative costs relatively constant

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill the company accounts for business acquisitions under the purchase method whereby the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents the costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company had goodwill recorded of million at december  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that a future impairment of goodwill will not occur

the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent will be utilized for determining pension cost 
in determining and pension cost  percent was utilized 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  the company also considers the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of basis points from the rate used at december  and basis points from that used at december  increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension cost of million net of a curtailment gain of million related to its supplemental executive retirement plan  as a result of the departure of the company s chief operating officer 
pension costs were million for both and as discussed above  the company lowered the discount rate to percent for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost for is expected to be approximately million 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  the federal pension funding equity act the act was enacted 
the act provided a two year relief from the significant pension contribution requirements that had evolved from the low interest rates utilized to determine the current liability for pension plans 
in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the company disclosed that pension funding for would approximate million 
the relief provided under the act reduced the company s required contributions for to approximately million 
the act expired on december   which will increase the company s required contributions in the company contributed approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute million in effective january   lydall closed the non union pension plans to new employees hired after december  the closure of these plans is not expected to have a material change on pension expense or required contributions in the near term 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on the distribution to the united states because it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
if remitted  the additional united states tax liability is not expected to be material 
the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be adversely affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  and or by changes in tax law or interpretations thereof 
in  the ajca was signed into law by the president of the united states 
this act provided for a phase out of the extraterritorial income program eti as provided for in the united states internal revenue code and also allows for certain tax benefits for us manufacturers that are intended to offset the eti phase out 
during and  the eti benefit decreased the company s effective tax rate by approximately and percentage points  respectively 
at this time the company is unable to determine the exact impact that the eti phase out and implementation of the manufacturer benefit system will have on future financial results  however  it is not expected that such changes will have a material impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows in future periods
