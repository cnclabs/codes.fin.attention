litigation settlement on february   we entered into a settlement agreement and related license agreement with dr 
mark l 
kozam d b a mlk software and datasci  llc 
the settlement agreement relates to a lawsuit filed by datasci in alleging that certain of our products and services and certain products and services of one of our customers  quintiles  inc  infringe a united states patent claimed to be owned by datasci 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment to datasci in the amount of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
the confidential settlement  in which neither party admits liability  provides for mutual releases and dismissal of all actions between the parties 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
additional information concerning this lawsuit is provided in this annual report under item legal proceedings 
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from software licenses and services 
license revenue is derived principally from the sale of multi year software term licenses for our inform  clintrial and clintrace software products 
service revenue is derived principally from our delivery of the hosted solution of our inform software product  consulting services and customer support  including training 
revenues for the webvdme  ctsd and websdm products for the period from the august  acquisition of lincoln to december  consisted of consulting services revenue 
in the future  we anticipate that we will generate license  hosting and customer support revenues from webvdme  ctsd and websdm as well 
we generally recognize revenues ratably over the life of a license or service contract 
this allows us to maintain a backlog that provides multi year visibility in revenue 
two customers  glaxosmithkline and eli lilly and company  the holder of record of approximately one percent of our common stock  together accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively 
our top customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in and  respectively  net of reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
license revenue we derive our license revenues from our three major software products inform  our internet based electronic data capture solution  clintrial  our clinical data management solution  and clintrace  our drug safety solution 
although each of our inform  clintrial and clintrace software solutions are available as stand alone enterprise applications  we offer integrated enterprise solutions incorporating certain of our electronic data capture  data management and drug safety products 
license revenues for our inform electronic data capture software solution  either on a stand alone or integrated basis  are determined primarily by the number  complexity and duration of the clinical trials and the number of participants in each clinical trial 
license revenues for our clintrial and clintrace software solutions are determined primarily by the number of users accessing the software solution 
except as discussed below  we enter into software license agreements for inform  clintrial and clintrace with terms generally of three to five years with payment terms generally annually in advance 
license agreements for webvdme  ctsd and websdm are typically annual with payment terms generally in advance 
license revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the software term license agreement  to the extent that amounts are fixed or determinable and collectable 
following our acquisition of clinsoft in august  we began converting holders of clinsoft perpetual software licenses to our software term license arrangements 
we continue to sell perpetual licenses of these products in certain situations to our existing customers  and may in the future do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions 
we recognize revenue on the perpetual licenses upon delivery of the software 
perpetual license revenue represented less than one percent of total revenue for the years ended december  and we continue to provide and charge for maintenance and support on our products to those customers who do not convert to our software term license arrangements 
we generally charge of the perpetual license fee for customer support 
we will continue our efforts to convert the remaining former clinsoft customer base to software term license arrangements 
however  we anticipate that some customers will not convert and instead will continue to make annual customer support payments 
service revenue application hosting services 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and wedsdm software as hosted application solutions delivered through a standard web browser  with customer support and training services 
services revenue from application hosting services is derived principally from our inform hosted solution 
revenue resulting from the inform hosting service consists of three stages for each clinical trial first stage trial and application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  installation and server configuration of the system  second stage application hosting and related support services  and third stage services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis depending upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenue from all stages of the hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred until the start of the hosting period and then amortized ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the deferred costs include direct costs related to the trial and application set up 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element is the revenue attributable to the software license used by the customer 
in addition  application hosting services revenue includes reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
in the event that an application hosting customer cancels a clinical trial and its related statement of work  all deferred revenue is recognized and all deferred set up costs are expensed and certain termination related fees may be charged 
in addition  application hosting services revenue includes hosting services associated with term license customers and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
revenue resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consists of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the service 
consulting services 
consulting services include the design and documentation of the processes related to our customers use of our products and services in their clinical trials 
consulting services also include project planning and management services  guidance on best practices in using our software products  data management and configuration services for data mining and reporting  as well as implementation services consisting of application architecture design  systems integration  installation and validation 
revenues from consulting services included in either a multiple element software license agreement or in an application hosting agreement are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
the associated costs are expensed as incurred 
revenues from consulting services that are not included in a multiple element software license arrangement are recognized as services are performed 
fixed priced arrangements are billed based upon contractual milestones  and time and materials arrangements are billed monthly 
customer support 
we have a multinational services organization to support our software products and hosted solutions worldwide 
customer support includes telephone support  software maintenance and training 
we bundle customer support in our software term licenses and allocate of the value of the license to customer support revenue 
our customer support revenue also consists of customer support fees paid by perpetual license customers 
customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the customer support or term license agreement  with payment terms generally annually in advance 
cost of revenues and operating expenses we allocate overhead expenses such as rent and occupancy charges and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of service revenues and in the sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expense categories 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the amortization of royalties paid for certain modules within our clintrial software product as well as our inform software product 
in addition to these costs we have also incurred expense for the amortization of acquired technologies associated with the acquisition of lincoln 
the cost of license revenue varies based upon the mix of revenue from software licenses for our products 
we operate our service organization on a global basis as one distinct unit  and do not segment costs for our various service revenue elements 
these services include performing application hosting  consulting and customer support services  and costs consist primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  amortization of the deferred clinical trial set up costs  allocated overhead  outside contractors  royalties associated with providing customer support for use with the clintrial and inform software products and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
cost of services also includes hosting costs that primarily consist of hosting facility fees and server depreciation 
the cost of service revenue varies based upon the number of employees in the service organization  the type of work performed  and royalties associated with revenue derived from providing customer support  as well as costs associated with the flexible use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
we supplement the trial design and set up activity for inform application hosting services through the use of outside contractors 
this allows us to utilize outside contractors in those periods where trial design and set up activity is highest while reducing the use of outside contractors in those periods where trial activity lessens  allowing for a more flexible delivery model 
the percentage of the services workforce represented by outside contractors varies from period to period depending on the volume of specific support required 
during  utilization of outside contractors varied from approximately to of our services workforce 
the cost of services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our cost of license revenue primarily due to the employee related and outside contractor expenses associated with providing services 
gross margin 
our gross margin on license revenue varies based on the mix of royalty and non royalty bearing license revenue and the amount of amortization of acquired technologies 
our gross margin on service revenue varies primarily due to variations in the utilization levels of the professional service team and the timing of expense and revenue recognition under our service arrangements 
in situations where the service revenue is recognized ratably over the software license term  typically three to five years  our costs associated with delivery of the services are recognized as the services are performed  which is typically during the first to months of the contract period 
accordingly  our gross margin on service revenue will vary significantly over the life of a contract due to the timing  amount and type of service required in delivering certain projects 
in addition  consolidated gross margin will vary depending upon the mix of license and service revenue 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs which include product marketing expenses such as trade shows  workshops and seminars  corporate communications  other brand building and advertising  allocated overhead and the amortization of commissions 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expand and further penetrate our customer base  expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities associated with existing and new product and service offerings  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead and outside contractors 
we focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality  performance and integration of our software products 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we introduce additional integrated software solutions to our product suite 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  primarily consisting of expenses for accounting  compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and legal services  including litigation  information technology and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will fluctuate quarter by quarter due to the timing of outside contractor and professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  as well as legal services 
litigation settlement 
on february   we entered into the settlement agreement and related license agreement described above in this section under the heading litigation settlement to settle litigation concerning allegations that we infringed a patent claimed to be owned by a third party 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the litigation 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
we incurred expense of approximately million in each of and relating to our defense in this suit  which is included in general and administrative expenses 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in which related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
this charge includes approximately million relating to the estimated future obligation under the non cancelable lease and an approximate million write off of the related abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
as of march   payments for all remaining expenses were completed and as a result we recorded a restructuring benefit of  representing the elimination of accrued expenses associated with the restructuring charge 
stock based compensation expenses 
our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative cost of service revenues include stock based compensation expenses related to the fair value of options issued to non employees and option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price is determined to be less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
foreign currency translation with regard to our international operations  we frequently enter into transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  our revenues  expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business  our foreign currency based revenues and expenses generally increase in value when translated into us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions with our audit committee  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred set up costs  commissions and royalties  accounts receivable reserves  stock based compensation  long lived assets  intangibles assets and goodwill  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred set up costs 
we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  while revenues resulting from application services are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware and securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
on august   we adopted eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
customers generally have the ability to terminate application hosting  consulting and training service agreements upon days notice to us 
license agreements  multiple element arrangements  including license and services agreements  and certain application hosting services can generally be terminated by either party for material breach of obligations not corrected within days after notice of the breach 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we generally enter into software term licenses for our inform  clintrial and clintrace products with our customers for to year periods 
license agreements for webvdme  ctsd and websdm are typically for one year terms 
these arrangements typically include multiple elements software license  consulting services and customer support 
we bill our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 
generally  we bill license fees annually in advance for each year of the license term 
our payment terms are generally net days 
our software license revenue is earned from the sale of off the shelf software requiring no significant modification or customization subsequent to delivery to the customer 
consulting services  which can also be performed by third party consultants  are deemed to be non essential to the functionality of the software and typically are for trial configuration  implementation planning  loading of software  building simple interfaces and running test data and documentation of procedures 
we generally bundle customer support with the software license for the entire term of the arrangement 
as a result  we generally recognize revenue for all elements  including consulting services  ratably over the term of the software license and support arrangement 
we allocate the revenue recognized for these arrangements to the different elements based on management s estimate of the relative fair value of each element 
for our term based licenses  we allocate to consulting services the anticipated service effort and value throughout the term of the arrangement at an amount that would have been allocated had those services been sold separately to the customer 
the remaining value is allocated to license and support services  with of this amount allocated to support services 
we have allocated the estimated fair value to our multiple element arrangements to provide meaningful disclosures about each of our revenue streams 
the costs associated with the consulting and customer support services are expensed as incurred 
there are instances in which the we sell software licenses based on usage levels 
these software licenses can be based on estimated usage  in which case the license fee charged to the customer is fixed based on this estimate 
when the fee is fixed  the revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement 
if the fee is based on actual usage  and therefore variable  the revenue is recognized in the period of use 
revenue from certain follow on consulting services  which are sold separately to customers with existing software licenses and are not considered part of a multiple element arrangement  is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from perpetual software licenses represented less than one percent of total revenues in  and we continue to sell perpetual licenses for the clintrial and clintrace software products in certain situations to our existing customers with the option to purchase customer support 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the customer support 
accordingly  license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying support arrangement 
we continue to generate customer support and maintenance revenue from our perpetual license customer base 
training revenue is recognized as earned 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software solutions through a hosted application solution delivered through a standard web browser 
revenue resulting from inform application hosting services consist of three stages for each clinical trial the first stage involves application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  implementation of the system and server configuration  the second stage involves application hosting and related support services  and the third stage involves services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis based upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenue from all stages of the inform hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred and capitalized as applicable  until the start of the hosting period and then amortized and recognized  as applicable  ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the capitalized costs include incremental direct costs with third parties and certain internal direct costs related to the trial and application set up  as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and indirect costs of leases 
these costs include salary and benefits associated with direct labor costs incurred during trial set up  as well as third party subcontract fees and other contract labor costs 
work performed outside the original scope of work is contracted for separately as an additional fee and is generally recognized ratably over the remaining term of the hosting period 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element is the revenue attributable to the software license used by the customer 
revenue resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consists of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the service 
we capitalized million  million and million of deferred set up costs and amortized million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the amortization of deferred set up costs is a component of cost of services 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognition 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses on uncompleted application hosting contracts 
accounting for commission payments and royalties 
for arrangements where we recognize revenue over the relevant contract period  we defer related commission payments to our direct sales force and software license royalties paid to third parties and amortize these amounts over the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
this is done to better match commission and royalty expenses with the related revenues 
during  and  we deferred million  million and million  respectively  of commissions and amortized million  million and million  respectively  to sales and marketing expense 
royalties are paid on a percentage of billings basis for certain of our products 
during  and  we deferred million  million and million  respectively  of royalty expenditures and amortized million  million and million  respectively  to cost of license and service revenue 
accounts receivable reserves 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information available to us 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable reserves were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
in connection with preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate income tax expense in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and all prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the year ended december   due to the uncertainty in the ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our deferred tax assets and reduced the valuation allowance by million in december this benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million 
the american jobs creation act of the act introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
on october   the act was signed into law by the president 
even in light of the act  our current intention is to reinvest the total amount of our un remitted earnings in the local jurisdiction or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective 
as such  we have not provided us tax expense on the un remitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
accounting for stock based awards 
we record deferred stock based compensation in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
because there had been no public market for our stock prior to the july initial public offering of our common stock  or ipo  our board of directors had determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  our operating and financial performance  issuance of convertible preferred stock  the rights and preferences of all securities senior to common stock and the anticipated offering price of our common stock in connection with the initial public offering 
in and  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million and million  respectively 
during  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of  million and  respectively 
as of december   there was an aggregate of  of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized approximately as follows  in the year ended december    in the year ended december    in the year ended december    in the year ended december   and  through december  we have adopted a fair value approach to valuing stock based awards effective january   which will have a significant impact on our operating results in future periods 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in the past  we have awarded a limited number of stock options to non employees 
for these options  we recognize the stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the underlying awards  based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
other significant estimates goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets periodically based upon the expected future discounted operating cash flows of our business 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of our operating results in future periods 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the timing and size of impairment charges  if any  involves the application of management s judgment regarding the estimates and could significantly affect our operating results 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in which related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
this charge includes approximately million relating to the estimated future obligation under the non cancelable lease and an approximate million write off of the related abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
as of march   payments for all remaining expenses were completed and as a result we recorded a benefit of  representing the elimination of accrued expenses associated with the restructuring charge 
overview of results of operations for the years ended december  and in  we signed contracted orders of million compared to million in in  we had one contracted order that was in excess of million  whereas there was no similarly sized order in our backlog grew in to million at december   an increase of from million of backlog at december  the license portion of our backlog decreased from million at december  to million at december   representing a decrease 
the service portion of our backlog increased by during this same period from million to million 
in the future  we anticipate that the percentage of the license and service components of our backlog will fluctuate as a percentage of total backlog  primarily due to changes in the type  amounts and delivery schedules of license and service orders  which are based on the requirements of our customers 
approximately million of the december  total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue in approximately of the value of our backlog as of december  represented contract commitments that may be cancelled by our customers at any time with limited notice 
based on historical cancellations since the inception of our company in  less than of the value of our total backlog is estimated to be at risk for cancellation prior to completion 
total revenues increased by in compared to due to increases in both license and service revenues of and  respectively 
our gross margin increased by or million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to the increase in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue  an increase in services revenue  and the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of related revenue  resulting from additional efficiencies relating to services delivery and increased utilization of our services personnel  which led to higher services margins 
operating income in decreased by million from operating income of million in  resulting in an operating loss of  in the operating income in included an million charge relating to a litigation settlement 
operating income in and included restructuring benefits of  and  respectively 
the operating income for the years ended december  and also included million and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the results for the year ended december  were impacted favorably by foreign exchange rate fluctuations  resulting in an approximately increase in revenues for the period 
foreign exchange fluctuations did not impact expenses in as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  an increase of million from million at december  as of december   we had no outstanding debt 
revenues year ended december  change revenues amount percentage of revenue amount percentage of revenue amount in thousands license application hosting services consulting services customer support total total revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in license revenue as well as an increase in consulting services and hosted solutions revenue 
the increase in license revenue for was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our inform product 
the increase in consulting revenue was primarily attributable to services relating to inform as well as new business relating to the webvdme product we began offering after the august acquisition of lincoln 
the increase in revenue associated with the hosted application of our inform product in was due to an increase in trials under management  which include both application hosting services trials as well as trials hosted for our inform license customers 
the decrease in customer support revenue in was due primarily to a reduction in the clintrial maintenance renewal base as a result of the conversion of the former clinsoft customers to term based licenses that have a lower customer support fee  partially offset by an increase in inform support due to an increase in inform training revenue 
our revenues were not significantly impacted by price increases or decreases 
inflation had only a nominal impact on our revenues 
in the future  we anticipate that the percentage of license revenues and service revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues  primarily due to changes in the type  amounts and delivery schedules of license and service orders  which are based on the requirements of our customers 
year ended december  change revenues by geography amount percentage of revenue amount percentage of revenue amount in thousands united states united kingdom france asia pacific international subtotal total the increase in revenues worldwide was due to the increase in license revenue associated with our inform  clintrial and clintrace products  as well as an increase in consulting and inform application hosting services

cost of revenues year ended december  change costs of revenues amount percentage of related revenue amount percentage of related revenue amount in thousands license services total the cost of license revenue increased in primarily due to a  increase in cost of royalties associated with our inform software product and to a lesser extent certain modules of the clintrial software product 
in addition  amortization expense from acquired technologies relating to our recent acquisition of lincoln increased by  the increase in cost of services in was due primarily to increases in contractor and employee related expenses of million and million  respectively  associated with delivering increased services revenues 
we also had expense increases for depreciation and computer related expenses of  and  which were the result of having more trials under management in as compared to computer related expenses include hardware and software support agreements as well as computer accessories 
these increases were partially offset by a benefit of trial set up expense net of amortization of  associated with an increase in trials in the set up phase for application hosting service arrangements  for which the associated expenses were deferred and recognized over the duration of the trial  rather than expensed as incurred 
gross margin year ended december  change gross margin amount percentage of related revenue amount percentage of related revenue amount in thousands license services total the license gross margin percentage was unchanged in as compared to at of related revenue as expenses grew proportionately with revenues 
the services gross margin percentage increased during due to an increase in revenue from consulting services performed on a time and material basis for some of our enterprise customers  rather than services performed under bundled arrangements 
when services are performed on a time and material basis  the timing of expense and revenue recognition is more closely aligned than when services are performed under bundled arrangements  where the revenue is recognized ratably over the license period  while the expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  application hosting services revenues grew as a result of an increase in trials under management 
we also experienced lower services expenses as a percentage of related revenues  due to increased efficiencies resulting in an increase in services revenue per services employee 
it is likely that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate quarter by quarter due to the timing and mix of license and service revenues  and the type  amount and timing of service required in delivering certain projects 
operating expenses year ended december  change operating expenses amount percentage of revenue amount percentage of revenue amount in thousands sales and marketing research and development general and administrative litigation settlement nm restructuring total sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in primarily due to a  increase in employee related expenses related to a headcount increase of people and personnel changes  and a  increase in commission expense due to both an increase in revenues and an increase in the effective commission rate 
other increases in marketing programs and related expense of  and contractor expense of  were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy expense of  we expect that our sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars as commission expense increases with our revenues and as we continue to expand sales coverage and to build brand awareness through what we believe are the most cost effective channels available  but will fluctuate due to the timing of marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to employee related expenses of million  resulting from a full year of expense relating to a headcount increase of people that occurred in  as well as incremental expense associated with a headcount increase of people that occured in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in outside contractor expense of  as we brought certain research and development activities in house 
we expect that our research and development costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add features and functionality to our products and expand our product and service offerings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  primarily due to increases of  in legal and accounting fees   in investor relation expenses and  in insurance expense  all primarily associated with our first full year operating as a public company 
in addition  outside contractor expenses increased  primarily related to preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of further expense increases included employee related expenses of  related to a headcount increase of people  computer and related expenses of  and taxes and fees of  these expense increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
litigation settlement 
on february   we entered into the settlement agreement and related license agreement described above in this section under the heading litigation settlement to settle litigation concerning allegations that we infringed a patent claimed to be owned by a third party 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid  worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
we incurred expense of approximately million in each of and relating to our defense in this suit  which is included in general and administrative expense 
operating income loss  other income expense year ended december  change amount percentage of revenue amount percentage of revenue amount in thousands operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense total other income operating income loss 
the decrease in operating income in the year ended december  was primarily due to the litigation settlement of million and an overall increase in other operating expenses which was offset by increases in gross margin from both license and services and a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
other income expense 
the increase in interest income in the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents available for investment  short term investments and an increase in the yield on investment 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the pay off of our debt in the quarter ended march  other  net expense increased primarily due to foreign exchange losses compared to foreign exchange gains related to unfavorable exchange rate movements on non us dollar denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes year ended december  change amount percentage of revenue amount percentage of revenue amount in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and represents foreign withholding taxes and income taxes payable in both our us operations and in certain foreign locations that cannot be offset through loss carryforwards 
in addition  the tax rate included a benefit from the release of a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate for decreased to an effective tax benefit of compared to an effective tax provision of for the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in our valuation allowance of million  which was recognized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million 
these reductions are reflected in the effective tax rate benefit of associated with changes to our valuation allowance 
this benefit was partially offset by a reduction in non deductible stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent  a reduction in the amount of net operating losses utilized to reduce tax expense 
in utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards  we are required to use our net operating losses in the order they were incurred 
as a result  most of the net operating losses we have used to date reflect those acquired in the clinsoft acquisition 
the utilization of the acquired net operating losses reduces the amount of income taxes payable to local tax authorities 
overview of results of operations for the years ended december  and in  we signed contracted orders of million compared to million in in  we had one contracted order that was in excess of million  whereas there was no similarly sized order in our backlog grew significantly in to million at december   an increase of from million of backlog at december  the license portion of our backlog grew from million at december  to million at december   representing a increase 
the increase in license backlog was due primarily to an increase in license sales of our inform product to our existing clintrial customers  which reflects an increase in the adoption of our products

revenues year ended december  change percentage percentage revenues amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands license application hosting services consulting services customer support total total revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to an increase in license revenue across all products as well as inform application hosting services revenue 
the increase in license revenue for was primarily due an increase in sales of clintrial and clintrace to existing customers and to an increase in sales of inform into our existing clintrial customer base 
this increase was a result of our continued strategy to expand the usage of our software products by cross selling the inform  clintrial and clintrace products to our existing customer base  additional utilization of our products within our customer base and sales to new customers 
the increase in revenue associated with the hosted application of our inform product in was due to an increase in trials under management 
consulting services revenue in decreased compared to the same period in the decrease in consulting services revenue was due primarily to the completion of certain clintrace related projects  and  to a lesser extent completion of certain projects associated with integrated enterprise solutions 
the decrease in customer support revenue in was due primarily to a reduction in the clintrial and clintrace maintenance renewal base as a result of the conversion of the former clinsoft customers to term based licenses that have a lower customer support fee  partially offset by an increase in inform support due to an increase in inform license revenue 
our revenues were not significantly impacted by price increases or decreases 
inflation had only a nominal impact on revenues

the increase in international revenues is primarily the result of additional enterprise wide license arrangements as well as application hosting services 
costs of revenues year ended december  change percentage percentage of related of related costs of revenue amount revenue amount revenue amount in thousands license services total the cost of license revenue decreased in primarily due to a million decrease in amortization expense from acquired technologies for clinsoft partially offset by an increase in royalty expense of  as revenue increased on certain modules of the clintrial software product  and to a lesser extent  the japanese version of our inform software product 
the decrease in the cost of services in was due primarily to a  reduction in reimbursable out of pocket expenses  as well as a decrease in facilities and depreciation expense of  and  respectively  primarily resulting from cost savings associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of additionally  stock based compensation decreased by  as did royalty expense by  primarily due to the decrease in customer support revenue from licenses of the clintrial software product 
these expense decreases were offset by increases in outside contractor expense of  employee related expenses of  while headcount remained relatively constant during these periods and an expense increase relating to additional trial set up expense net of amortization of  associated with a decrease in the amount of time spent in the set up phase for application hosting service arrangements  for which the associated expenses were deferred and recognized over the duration of the trial  rather than expensed as incurred

operating expenses year ended december  change percentage percentage operating expenses amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring total sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in primarily due to a  increase in employee related expenses  a million increase in commission expense due to both an increase in revenues and an increase in the effective commission rate  which was partially offset by a  decrease in marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses of million as we hired additional people to expand and improve our quality assurance and product development team  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
this was partially offset by a  decrease in outside contractors as we brought certain research and development activities in house and a  decrease in depreciation expense from cost savings associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation  an increase in professional fees of million primarily relating to legal fees associated with actions defending the lawsuit we settled in february  as described in this annual report under item legal proceedings  and an increase in employee related expenses of  while headcount remained stable during these periods  and an increase in insurance of  due to additional requirements relating to being a public company 
this was partially offset by decreases in depreciation and occupancy of  and  respectively 
these decreases resulted from cost savings associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of operating income loss  other income expense year ended december  change percentage percentage amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense total operating income loss 
the increase in operating income in the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in gross margin from both license and services  partially offset by increased operating expenses  resulting from increases in employee related expenses  commission expense  stock based compensation  and professional fees 
other income expense 
the increase in interest income in the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents available for investment and  of interest received in connection with the repayment of a subscription receivable 
other income expense decreased due to a decrease in the foreign exchange gains related to exchange rate movements on both non us dollar denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances partially offset by forward foreign exchange contracts and lower non us dollar denominated accounts receivable and intercompany balances 
provision for benefit from income taxes year ended december  change percentage percentage provision for benefit from income taxes amount of revenue amount of revenue amount in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in represents foreign withholding taxes and income taxes payable in certain foreign locations that cannot be offset through loss carryforwards 
the provision for income taxes in represents foreign withholding taxes and income taxes payable in both our us operations and in certain foreign locations that cannot be offset through loss carryforwards 
the effective tax rate for increased to compared to an effective tax rate of for the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to our domestic profitability 
in utilizing our net operating loss carryforwards  we are required to use our oldest net operating losses first 
as a result  we have first used the net operating losses acquired in the clinsoft acquisition 
the utilization of the acquired net operating losses reduces the amount of income taxes payable to local tax authorities 
this benefit has been reflected as a reduction of goodwill 
additionally  our effective tax rate exceeds our statutory tax rate due to the current non deductibility of our stock based compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
from our inception  we funded our operations primarily through issuances of convertible preferred stock for aggregate net cash proceeds of million  including net cash acquired in the clinsoft acquisition  the proceeds from the initial public offering and exercise of the over allotment option resulting in net proceeds of million  the issuance of notes payable for an aggregate of million  and stock option exercises resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of million 
cash provided by and used in operating activities has historically been affected by changes in working capital accounts  primarily deferred revenue  accounts receivable and accrued expenses  and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
fluctuations within accounts receivable and deferred revenue are primarily related to the timing of billings of our term license customers and the associated revenue recognition 
movements in deferred costs are related to the volume and stages of hosted clinical trials and movements in accrued expenses and accounts payable are due to the timing of certain transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was greater than net income of million 
this difference is primarily due to million of non cash depreciation and amortization  million of non cash income tax expense   of stock based compensation  increases in deferred revenue of million and accrued litigation settlement of million  partially offset by an increase of million in deferred income taxes  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred costs of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million during  which was primarily due to million used in the acquisition of lincoln  purchase of short term investments of million and capital expenditures associated with computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of our expanding work force of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from maturities of short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was  in  consisting primarily of the million of debt repayments as we paid all of our outstanding bank debt  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock options and sales of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding letters of credit related to our facilities 
the letters of credit reduce the amounts available under our line of credit with a bank 
substantially all of our long lived assets for the years ended december  and are located in the united states 
we generally do not enter into long term binding purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases for office space 
the following table of our material contractual obligations as of december  summarizes the aggregate effect that these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated contractual obligations payments due by period total year or less years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations total between april and september  we entered into several equipment lines of credit with a bank 
all advances under these equipment lines of credit were payable in to equal monthly installments of principal  plus accrued interest 
the interest that accrued under these notes ranged from prime rate and at december  and march   respectively to prime rate plus 
at december  there was a total of million outstanding and million available under all of our equipment lines of credit 
in march  we paid in full our outstanding debt related to our equipment lines of credit 
the equipment lines of credit expired on march  and were not renewed 
effective march   we renewed our working capital line of credit with a bank and increased the amount under which we can borrow to million 
interest accrues at prime rate 
all advances made under the working capital line are due and payable on march  as of december  and  was outstanding under the working capital line of credit 
at december   there was million available under the line of credit  and million reserved under a letter of credit associated with our leased facilities 
borrowings under our working capital line of credit were secured by substantially all of our assets 
we had also entered into a negative pledge agreement that  subject to certain exceptions  generally prohibited us from pledging our intellectual property to others 
in august  the working capital line of credit was amended to eliminate the security interest in our assets and the negative pledge on our intellectual property 
the amendment also removed or modified the financial covenants 
under the terms of this credit line  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants 
at december    we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
at december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards and million of federal research and development tax credit carryforwards that may be used to offset future us federal taxable income 
approximately million and million of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards were acquired in the clinsoft acquisition 
these attributes may reduce our future cash tax liability  however this benefit will be reflected through reductions to goodwill and not as reductions to income tax expense 
additionally  we had million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward period extends through and both are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
also  the internal revenue code contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available in any given year in the event of certain changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash provided by operating activities and our various debt facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services  and the continuing market acceptance of our services 
to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
from time to time  we may also enter into agreements with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted for fiscal years starting after june  we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  stock based compensation expense is recognized a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted on or after january  and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards that were granted to employees prior to january  we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we historically accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no stock based compensation expense for employee stock options when the exercise price of options granted under these plans equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value methods will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations cannot be predicted with certainty as it is principally a function of the number of options granted since our initial public offering  the number of options to be granted in the future  the share price on the date of grant  the expected life of the award  and volatility and estimated forfeitures 
we currently estimate that the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r will result in a charge of between million and million to our results of operations based on options and awards granted prior to and during in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  forward foreign exchange contracts and a line of credit 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
except for revenue transactions in japan  we enter into transactions directly with substantially all of our foreign customers 
this creates a foreign currency exchange risk for us 
as of december  and  we had million and million of receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
if the foreign exchange rates fluctuated by as of december  and  our foreign exchange receivable exposure would have fluctuated by approximately  and  respectively 
in addition  although our foreign subsidiaries have intercompany accounts that eliminate upon consolidation  such accounts expose us to foreign currency rate movements 
exchange rate fluctuations on short term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations under other income expense  while exchange rate fluctuations on long term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
we also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other than the local currency which expose us to foreign exchange rate movements 
we have implemented a risk management program under which we measure foreign currency exchange risk monthly and manage those exposures through the use of various internal controls and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts 
this process is designed to minimize foreign currency translation exposures that could otherwise affect consolidated results of operations 
as of december  and we entered into contracts to hedge approximately million and million  respectively  of receivables  intercompany accounts and cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
investments in securities are invested primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
we have a working capital line of credit which bears interest based upon the prime rate 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under our working capital line of credit
