both adjusted earnings and ebitda should be examined in conjunction with net income as shown in the consolidated statements of operations 
neither adjusted earnings nor ebitda should be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is either measure indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs or available for distribution to shareholders 
rather  adjusted earnings and ebitda are additional measures the company uses to analyze how its business is performing 
its should be noted that the company s manner of calculating adjusted earnings and ebitda may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies 
combined fixed charges are comprised of interest expense including amortization of original issue discount and preferred stock dividend requirements 
for the purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of income from continuing operations before adjustment for minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries  or income or loss from equity investees  income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus fixed charges and certain other adjustments 
fixed charges consist of interest incurred on all indebtedness related to continuing and discontinued operations including amortization of original issue discount and the implied interest component of the company s rent obligations in the years presented 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that our borrowers pay on our loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that our corporate customers pay us to lease our corporate tenant lease ctl properties 
a smaller and more variable source of revenue is other income  which consists primarily of prepayment penalties and realized gains that occur when our borrowers repay our loans before their maturity date 
we generate income from the differential between the revenues generated from our loans and leases and our interest expense and the cost of our operations  often referred to as the spread or margin 
the company seeks to match fund its revenue generating assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that rising interest rates or changes in the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on the company s earnings 
initially  we fund our new lending and leasing activity with our short term debt sources such as our lines of credit 
we then match fund our assets by raising longer term unsecured debt  secured debt and equity capital in the public and private capital markets 
key performance measures profitability metrics we use the following metrics  as determined on an annual basis  to measure our profitability adjusted diluted earnings per share see section captioned adjusted earnings for more information on this metric 
net finance margin  calculated as the rate of return on assets less the cost of debt 
the rate of return on assets is the sum of interest income and operating lease income  divided by the sum of average gross corporate tenant lease assets  average loans and other lending investments  average sfas no 
purchase intangibles and average assets held for sale over the period 
the cost of debt is the sum of interest expense and operating costs corporate tenant lease assets  divided by the average gross debt obligations over the period 
return on average common book equity  calculated as adjusted basic earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
we believe the following items are key factors in determining our current and future profitability asset growth our ability to originate new loans and leases and grow our asset base in a prudent manner 
risk management our ability to underwrite and manage our loans and leases to balance income production potential with the potential for credit losses 
cost and availability of funds our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates and terms and insulate our margin from changes in interest rates 
expense management our ability to maintain a customer oriented and cost effective operation 
capital management our ability to maintain a strong capital base through the use of prudent financial leverage 
key trends after experiencing more difficult economic and market conditions in and  the commercial real estate industry has experienced increasing property level returns throughout and continuing through during this period  the industry has attracted large amounts of investment capital which has increased property valuations across most sectors 
investors such as pension funds and foreign buyers have increased their allocations to real estate and private real estate funds and individual investors have raised record amounts of capital to invest in the sector 
at the same time  interest rates have remained at historically low levels 
more recently  the yield curve  or the difference between short term and long term interest rates  has flattened 
lower interest rates have enabled many property owners to finance their assets at attractive rates and proceeds levels 
default rates on commercial mortgages have steadily declined over the past ten years and are now under nationally 
as a result  many banks and insurance companies are increasing their real estate lending activities 
the securitization markets for commercial real estate  including both the commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and the collateralized debt obligation cdo markets  have experienced record issuance volumes and liquidity 
investors in this arena have been willing to buy increasingly complex and aggressively underwritten transactions 
while the fundamentals in most real estate markets are firming  valuations have increased at a faster pace than underlying cash flows due to the large supply of investor capital 
the commercial real estate industry has undergone a transformation over the past ten years 
during this time many large real estate owning companies went public and thousands of commercial real estate loans were rated and securitized 
this resulted in the public disclosure of significantly more property level and market data than had been available in the past 
in addition  numerous on line real estate data sources have been successful in filling the information void and have created publicly available data on almost all real estate asset types across the country 
access to this data has dramatically increased the visibility in the industry 
better disclosure and data has enabled broader and more informed investor participation in the sector and should be an important component in moderating the impact of the broader economic cycles on the real estate industry over longer periods of time 
the following discussion of our results describes the impact that the key trends have had  and are expected to continue to have for the foreseeable future on our business 
results profitability the following table summarizes the key metrics by which we measure the profitability of our operations for the years ended december  adjusted diluted earnings per share net finance margin return on average common book equity explanatory note for the year ended december   adjusted diluted earnings per share and return on average common book equity are and  respectively  excluding the million charge related to first quarter compensation charges and million of securities redemption charges  as further discussed below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the years ended december   and  operating lease income used to calculate the net finance margin does not include sfas no 
adjustments from discontinued operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  interest expense used to calculate the net finance margin does not include sfas no 
adjustments from discontinued operations of  and for the years ended december   and  operating costs corporate tenant lease assets used to calculate the net finance margin does not include sfas no 
adjustments from discontinued operations of   and  the following is an overview of how the company performed in respect to each key operating performance measure and how those items affected profitability and were impacted by key trends 
asset growth during the twelve months ended december   the company had billion of transaction volume representing financing commitments 
repeat customer business has become a key source of transaction volume for the company  accounting for approximately of the company s cumulative volume through december  transaction volume for the fiscal years ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
the company completed financing commitments in and in the company has also experienced significant growth during the last several years  having made a number of strategic acquisitions to complement its organic growth and extending its business franchise 
based upon feedback from its customers  the company believes that greater recognition of the company  its reputation for completing highly structured transactions in an efficient manner and its reduced cost of capital have contributed to increases in its transaction volume 
the benefits of higher investment volumes have been mitigated to an extent by the low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years 
low interest rates benefit the company in that our borrowing costs decrease  but similarly  earnings on its variable rate lending investments also decrease 
the increased investment and lending activity in both the public and private commercial real estate markets  as described under key trends  has resulted in a highly competitive real estate financing environment with reduced returns on assets 
the reduction in our return on assets has been partially offset by our lower cost of funds 
in addition  in and  many of the company s borrowers were able to prepay their loans with proceeds from initial public offerings  asset sales or refinancings 
as a consequence  the company experienced a higher level of prepayments in and than in previous years  which resulted in lower net asset growth gross origination volume plus additional fundings less loan repayments and ctl asset sales 
if significant amounts of investment capital continue to be allocated to commercial real estate and interest rates remain low  the company expects to continue to see relatively high levels of prepayments 
many of the company s loans have some form of call protection and can generate significant prepayment penalties 
prepayment penalties had a significant impact on the company s results of operations in and increased prepayment penalties result in higher other income in the current period  which is offset by reduced interest income  as the loan assets that are prepaid no longer generate recurring earnings 
over the past several years  while property level fundamentals have stabilized and are beginning to improve generally  investment activity in direct real estate ownership has increased dramatically 
in many cases  this has caused property valuations to increase disproportionately to any corresponding increase in fundamentals 
corporate tenant leases  or net leased properties  are one of the most stable real estate asset classes and have garnered significant interest from both institutional and retail investors who seek a long term stable income stream 
in many cases  the company believes that the valuations of ctl assets in today s market do not represent solid risk adjusted returns 
as a result  we have not invested as heavily in this asset class  acquiring only million in  compared to million in while we continue to monitor the ctl market and review certain transactions  we have shifted most of our origination resources to our lending business until we see compelling opportunities for ctl acquisitions in the market again 
despite the competitive environment  the company intends to maintain its disciplined approach to underwriting its investments and will adjust its focus away from markets and products where the company believes that the available pricing terms do not fairly reflect the risks of the investments 
we will also continue to maintain our disciplined investment strategy and deploy capital to those opportunities that demonstrate the most attractive returns 
risk management the company continued to manage its business to ensure that the overall credit quality of the portfolio remained strong 
there were no major changes to the portfolio credit statistics in versus the remaining weighted average duration of the loan portfolio is years 
at december   our internal risk ratings of the loan portfolio were essentially unchanged from year end the aggregate risk of principal loss  which was buoyed by the strong real estate investment markets  improved slightly 
the company has experienced minimal credit losses on its lending investments 
the company did not experience any credit losses in or  and only recognized a million loss in at december   our non performing loan assets represented of total assets versus at year end the company believes that we have adequate reserves in the event that additional credit losses were to occur 
at december   the risk rating on the ctl portfolio improved slightly from year end the company continues to focus on re leasing space at its ctl facilities under longer term leases in an effort to reduce the impact of lease expirations on the company s earnings 
as of december   the weighted average lease term on the company s ctl portfolio was years and the portfolio was leased 
the company expects the average lease term of its portfolio to decline somewhat until such time that the company begins to find new acquisition opportunities that meet its investment criteria 
cost and availability of funds in  the company began migrating its debt obligations from secured debt towards unsecured debt 
we believed that funding ourselves on an unsecured basis would enable us to better serve our customers  to more effectively match fund our assets and to provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
early in  we made significant progress to that end by completing a new unsecured bank facility that initially had million of capacity and was subsequently increased to billion of capacity in december the company also took advantage of the very low interest rate environment and issued longer term unsecured debt  using the proceeds to repay existing secured credit facilities and mortgage debt 
the company continued to emphasize its use of unsecured debt to fund new net asset growth and to repay existing secured debt in in october of  in part as a result of our shift to unsecured debt  the company s senior unsecured debt ratings were upgraded to investment grade bbb baa by s p and moody s 
this resulted in a broader market for our bonds and a lower cost of debt capital on incremental debt financings 
in  the company continued to broaden its sources of capital  particularly in the unsecured bank and bond markets 
we completed billion in bond offerings  upsized our unsecured credit facility to billion  eliminated three secured lines of credit and repaid our million of stars asset backed notes  which required us to take a one time million charge in the third quarter of our financing activities in have now lowered our percentage of secured debt to total debt to at the end of from at the end of as a result  we have completed our goals of substantially unencumbering our asset base  decreasing secured debt and increasing our unsecured credit capacity to replace our secured facilities 
the company seeks to match fund its assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that rising interest rates or changes in the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on the company s earnings 
the company s policy requires that we manage our fixed floating rate exposure such that a basis point move in short term interest rates would have no more than a impact on our quarterly adjusted earnings 
at december   a basis point increase in libor would result in a decrease in our fourth quarter adjusted earnings 
the company has used fixed rate or floating rate hedges to manage its fixed and floating rate exposure  however  because the company now has investment grade credit ratings  it is able to access the floating rate debt markets 
in the future the company expects to decrease the need for synthetic hedging to match fund its debt 
while the company considers it prudent to have a broad array of sources of capital  including some secured financing arrangements  the company expects to continue to emphasize its use of unsecured debt in funding its net asset growth going forward 
we believe that the company has ample short term capital available to provide liquidity and to fund our business 
in addition  during the first quarter of  s p  moody s and fitch upgraded the company s senior unsecured debt rating to bbb  baa  and bbb from bbb  baa and bbb  respectively 
expense management we measure the efficiency of our operations by tracking our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of general and administrative expenses plus general and administrative stock based compensation to total revenue  excluding sfas no 
adjustments from discontinued operations 
we exclude the impact of subsequent adjustments from discontinued operations  because we are seeking to analyze our actual efficiency experience during the relevant period  as measured by the ratio of historical general and administrative expenses to historical revenues  generated by our operations and our assets owned during that period  regardless of whether we subsequently decided to sell one or more assets in a later period 
our efficiency ratio was  and for  and  respectively 
the ratio was excluding million of executive stock based compensation charges 
the efficiency ratios for  and  include million  million and million of income from discontinued operations  respectively 
in  our efficiency ratio reflected increases in payroll costs  expenses associated with employee growth  expenses related to our acquisition of falcon financial and the ramp up of several new business initiatives including our autostar venture 
management talent is one of our most significant assets and our payroll costs are correspondingly our largest non interest cash expense 
the market for management talent is highly competitive and we do not expect to materially decrease this expense in the coming years 
however  we believe that our efficiency ratio remains low by industry standards and expect it to normalize somewhat as acquisitions and new businesses stabilize 
capital management the company uses a dynamic capital allocation model to derive its maximum targeted corporate leverage 
we calculate our leverage as the ratio of book debt to the sum of book equity  accumulated depreciation  accumulated depletion and loan loss reserves 
our maximum targeted leverage was x  x and x at the end of  and  respectively 
the company s actual leverage was x  x and x in  and  respectively 
in  when the company went public  our leverage levels were very low  around x 
since that time the company has been slowly increasing its leverage to its targeted levels 
we evaluate our capital model target leverage levels based upon leverage levels achieved by similar assets in other markets  market liquidity levels for underlying assets and default and severity experience 
our data currently suggest that capital levels of certain of our asset categories are conservative 
we measure our capital management by the strength of our tangible capital base and the ratio of our tangible book equity to total book assets 
our tangible book equity was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our ratio of tangible book equity to total book assets was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the decline in this ratio is attributable to the company s modest increase in financial leverage as we have moved towards our target capital level 
we believe that relative to other finance companies  we are very well capitalized for a company of our size and asset base 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest income interest income increased by million to million for the months ended december   from million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to million of interest income on new originations or additional fundings  offset by a million decrease from the repayment of loans and other lending investments

adjusted earnings the company measures its performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represent net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain loss from discontinued operations  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect the company s share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
the company believes that adjusted earnings is a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income  because this measure helps the company to evaluate how its commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that the company excludes in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation  depletion and amortization 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  the company records significant depreciation on its real estate assets and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with its borrowings 
the company also records depletion on its timber assets  although depletion amounts are currently insignificant 
depreciation  depletion and amortization do not affect the company s daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
by measuring its performance using adjusted earnings and net income  the company is able to evaluate how its business is performing both before and after giving effect to recurring gaap adjustments such as depreciation  depletion and amortization and  in the case of adjusted earnings  after including earnings from its joint venture interests on the same basis and excluding gains or losses from the sale of assets that will no longer be part of its continuing operations 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s performance 
rather  the company believes that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps analyze how its business is performing 
this measure is also used to track compliance with covenants in certain of the company s material borrowing arrangements that have covenants based upon this measure 
adjusted earnings should not be viewed as an alternative measure of either the company s liquidity or funds available for its cash needs or for distribution to its shareholders 
in addition  the company may not calculate adjusted earnings in the same manner as other companies that use a similarly titled measure

the facility has a three year initial term with a one year extension at the company s option 
the facility initially bore interest at a rate of libor and a basis point annual facility fee 
due to an upgrade in the company s senior unsecured debt rating in  the facility began to bear interest at a rate of libor and a basis point annual facility fee  which was its effective rate through december  in addition  as a result of upgrades to the company s unsecured debt ratings in  the facility s interest rate will decrease to libor per annum  plus a basis point annual facility fee

hedging activities the company has variable rate lending assets and variable rate debt obligations 
these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that as interest rates increase  the company earns more on its variable rate lending assets and pays more on its variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  the company earns less on its variable rate lending assets and pays less on its variable rate debt obligations 
when the amount of the company s variable rate debt obligations exceeds the amount of its variable rate lending assets  the company utilizes derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income 
the company has a policy in place  that is administered by the audit committee  which requires the company to enter into hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the company s earnings 
the policy states that a basis point increase in short term rates cannot have a greater than impact on quarterly earnings 
the company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the derivative instruments the company uses are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps effectively can either change variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations or convert fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition  during the company also began using derivative instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
the primary risks from the company s use of derivative instruments are the risks that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that the company may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if a hedging arrangement is terminated by the company 
as a matter of policy  the company enters into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a a by s p and moody s  respectively 
the company s hedging strategy is approved and monitored by the company s audit committee on behalf of its board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors without shareholder approval

off balance sheet transactions the company is not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
as of december   the company did not have any ctl joint ventures accounted for under the equity method  which had third party debt 
the company s stars notes were all on balance sheet financings 
these securitizations were prepaid on september  the company has certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to its loans and other lending investments that it may be required to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which the company has sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those that the company is generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of the company s direct control 
as of december   the company had loans with unfunded commitments totaling billion  of which million was discretionary and billion was non discretionary 
in addition  the company has million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to ten ctl investments 
these commitments generally fall into two categories pre approved capital improvement projects  and new or additional construction costs 
upon funding  the company would receive additional operating lease income from the customers 
further  the company had three equity investments with unfunded non discretionary commitments of million 
ratings triggers the billion unsecured revolving credit facility that the company has in place at december   bore interest at libor per annum at that date based on the company s senior unsecured credit ratings of bbb from s p  baa from moody s and bbb from fitch ratings 
this rate was reduced from libor due to the company achieving an investment grade senior unsecured debt rating from s p in october due to the company achieving upgrades from s p and moody s in see below  the facility s interest rate has decreased to libor per annum 
on february   s p upgraded the company s senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb and raised the ratings on its preferred stock to bb from bb 
on february   moody s upgraded the company s senior unsecured debt rating to baa from baa and raised the ratings on its preferred stock to ba from ba on january   fitch ratings upgraded the company s senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb and raised our preferred stock rating to bb from bb  with a stable outlook 
the upgrades were primarily a result of the company s further migration to an unsecured capital structure  including the recent repayment of the stars notes 
as a result of the upgrades in of the company s senior unsecured debt ratings by s p  moody s and fitch  the financial covenants  including limitations on incurrence of indebtedness and maintenance of unencumbered assets compared to unsecured indebtedness  in some series of the company s publicly held debt securities are not operative 
if the company were to be downgraded from its current ratings by either s p or moody s  these financial covenants would become operative again 
on october   moody s upgraded the company s senior unsecured debt ratings to baa from ba the upgraded rating reflected the shift towards unsecured debt and the resulting increase in unencumbered assets  the continued profitable growth in the company s business franchise  the strong quality of both the structured finance and ctl business and the active management of those businesses 
on october   the company s senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded to an investment grade rating of bbb from bb by s p as a result of the company s positive track record of improving performance through a slightly difficult real estate cycle  its strong underwriting and servicing capabilities  the increase in capital base  the shift towards unsecured debt to free up assets and the staggering of maturities on secured debt

there are approximately million shares available for issuance under the plan as of december  stock repurchase program the board of directors approved  and the company has implemented  a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets or loan repayments and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under its credit facilities if the company determines that it is advantageous to do so 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company has not repurchased any shares under the stock repurchase program since november  however  the company issued approximately million shares of its treasury stock during see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and all entities consolidated under fasb interpretation no 
r 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant sources of the company s revenue come from its lending operations and its ctl operations 
for its lending operations  the company reflects income using the effective yield method  which recognizes periodic income over the expected term of the investment on a constant yield basis 
for ctl assets  the company recognizes income on the straight line method  which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments to be received by the company evenly over the term of the lease 
management believes the company s revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
reserve for loan losses the company s accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be reflected in the financial statements based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in its private lending assets 
while the company and its private predecessors have experienced minimal actual losses on their lending investments  management considers it prudent to reflect reserves for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon the company s assessment of general market conditions  the company s internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  the company s assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying its investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounting policy requires a reserve on the company s accrued operating lease income receivable balances and on the deferred operating lease income receivable balances 
the reserve covers asset specific problems eg  bankruptcy as they arise  as well as  a portfolio reserve based on management s evaluation of the credit risks associated with these receivables 
impairment of long lived assets ctl assets represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in its leasing operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  ctl assets to be held and used are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated recoverable amounts 
risk management and financial instruments the company has historically utilized derivative financial instruments only as a means to help to manage its interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its variable rate debt obligations ie  as cash flow hedges 
some of the instruments utilized are pay fixed swaps or libor based interest rate caps which are widely used in the industry and typically with major financial institutions 
the company s accounting policies generally reflect these instruments at their fair value with unrealized changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income losses on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
realized effects on the company s cash flows are generally recognized currently in income 
however  when appropriate the company enters into interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to variable rate in order to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations 
the company reflects these instruments at their fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
executive compensation the company s accounting policies generally provide cash compensation to be estimated and recognized over the period of service 
with respect to stock based compensation arrangements  as of july  with retroactive application to the beginning of the calendar year  the company has adopted the fair value method allowed under sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
on a prospective basis which values options on the date of grant and recognizes an expense equal to the fair value of the option multiplied by the number of options granted over the related service period 
these arrangements are often complex and generally structured to align the interests of management with those of the company s shareholders 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of such arrangements and the related accounting effects 
on february   the company entered into a new employment agreement with its chief executive officer which took effect upon the expiration of the old agreement 
during  the company also entered into a three year employment agreement with its president 
in addition  during  the company entered into a three year employment agreement with its chief financial officer 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these employment agreements 
in addition  during and the chief executive officer purchased an and interest in the company s and high performance unit program for executive officers  respectively 
the president also purchased a interest in both the company s and high performance unit program for executive officers  and a interest in the company s high performance unit program for executive officers 
these performance programs were approved by the company s shareholders in and are described in detail in the company s annual proxy statement 
the purchase price paid by the chief executive officer and president is based upon a valuation prepared by an independent investment banking firm 
the interests purchased by the chief executive officer and president will only have nominal value to them unless the company achieves total shareholder returns in excess of those achieved by peer group indices  all as more fully described in the company s annual proxy statement 
new accounting standards in march  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted fin during and it did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 accounting for non monetary transactions 
sfas no 
requires non monetary exchanges to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  if the transactions meet a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary transactions occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf states that a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership or similar entity and should consolidate the limited partnership unless one of the following two conditions exist the limited partners possess substantive kick out rights  or the limited partners possess substantive participating rights 
a kick out right is defined as the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner without cause or otherwise dissolve liquidate the limited patnership 
substantive participating rights are when the limited partners have the substantive right to participate in certain financial and operating decisions of the limited partnership that are made in the ordinary course of business 
the consensus guidance in eitf is effective for all agreements entered into or modified after june  for all pre existing agreements that are not modified  the consensus is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period beginning after december  the company does not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb released statement of financial accounting standards no

r  share based payment 
this standard requires issuers to measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period typically the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the company will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on their current fair value 
the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
companies can comply with fasb no

r as of january   and is still evaluating the financial impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing its business plan  the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with its liability management objectives  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
the company s operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on its assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on the company s interest bearing assets  which the company may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on its borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of the company s interest bearing assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of the company s interest earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to the company 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while the company generally seeks to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  the company could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risks while the company has not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to the company which adversely affect its liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs match funding based hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps  futures and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce the company s exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk of its borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between the company and a third party the counterparty 
when the company purchases a cap or floor contract  the company makes an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company in the future should the reference rate typically one  three or six month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  the company will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  the company will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
the company utilizes the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
the company s swaps are either pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from the company or pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from the company  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of the company s fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  the company would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may freely utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  prepayment or interest rate exposure on the company s loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  the company may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
the company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  the company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that the company will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract it enters into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease  or basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and equity in earnings of joint ventures as of december   less interest expense  operating costs on ctl assets and loss on early extinguishment of debt  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect to interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with the company s assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
many of the company s loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties  yield maintenance fees or contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
net fair value of financial instruments in the table below does not include ctl assets approximately of the company s total assets and certain forms of corporate finance investments but includes debt associated with the financing of these ctl assets 
therefore  the table below is not a meaningful representation of the estimated percentage change in net fair value of financial instruments with change in interest rates 
the estimated percentage change in net investment income does include operating lease income from ctl assets and therefore is a more accurate representation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net investment income
