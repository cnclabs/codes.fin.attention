item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
we have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology  chemistry  biophysics  automation and information technologies  with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive 
we have a number of drug candidates in development  including compounds targeting hcv infection  ra  cystic fibrosis  cancer  pain and hiv infection 
our corporate strategy is to retain principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of our proprietary drug candidates in certain major markets  concentrating a significant part of our overall development and commercialization resources on those drug candidates once we select them 
we intend to rely on collaborators to conduct development and commercialization of certain of our other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which we are not currently focused 
we are concentrating most of our drug development resources at the present time on three compounds vx for the treatment of hcv infection  vx for the treatment of ra  and vx for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a single new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process  which may take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a proposed drug candidate should be approved for marketing 
the toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored continually and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation method  or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated 
we have a variety of drug candidates in clinical development and a broad based drug discovery effort 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence which  if any  of these efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product 
we constantly monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and regularly evaluate our portfolio investments with the objective of balancing risk and potential return in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
business strategy we have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities  due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business 
we plan to expend significant resources on development and commercialization of some of our drug product candidates in certain markets  and rely on collaborators to conduct development and commercialization of certain of our other drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which we are not currently focused 
this diversification strategy requires more significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more limited approach 
because we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our discovery and development operations and our overhead and to meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations 
in the past  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the notes and million in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
during  we took a number of steps that we believe reinforced our ability to implement our business strategy 
in june  we completed a public equity offering and issued approximately million shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in september  we exchanged approximately million newly issued shares of common stock for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of notes  plus accrued interest  and in december  we exchanged approximately million newly issued shares of common stock for approximately million in aggregate principal amount of notes plus accrued interest  resulting in a net reduction by approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness 
during  we also signed new discovery and development collaborations with glaxosmithkline and avalon pharmaceuticals 
collaborations and collaborative revenues collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
we entered into two new collaborative relationships in  and extended the duration of our research collaboration with cfft early in in february  we licensed vx  an impdh inhibitor  to avalon pharmaceuticals  inc for development and commercialization in the treatment of cancer 
avalon has made an upfront payment and has committed to make milestone payments to us  to conduct further development of vx and to pay royalties to us if vx is successfully commercialized 
in december  we entered into a global collaboration with glaxosmithkline to develop and commercialize vx  our novel  subtype selective sodium channel modulator for the treatment of pain 
under that collaboration agreement  glaxosmithkline paid us a million up front license payment  and has committed to make milestone payments to us  conduct further development of vx and any backup compounds that are selected for development  and pay us royalties on future sales of vx and backup compounds 
early in  we extended the period of our research collaboration with cfft 
the amended cfft agreement provides for an additional million in continued research funding through early  to further investigate our corrector compounds to see if they act to restore the function of the cftr protein 
we retain the right to develop and commercialize any compounds discovered in the cfft collaboration  and will pay royalties to cfft upon the approval and commercialization of any compounds discovered under the collaboration 
our financial guidance for  as set forth below  reflects a significant increase in revenues over levels  an important part of which is anticipated revenue from new collaborations that we believe we could enter into this year 
these anticipated new collaborative revenues will be important in offsetting the loss of revenues as certain of our existing collaborations expire in our research collaborations with novartis and merck are scheduled to conclude  along with our research funding  in april and june  respectively 
revenue recognized from our merck and novartis collaborations accounted for approximately of our total collaborative research and development revenue in we may continue to realize revenue from these collaborations beyond their research term  in the form of milestone payments that may be earned if product candidates proceed successfully through development and royalties on sales of any resulting drugs 
we also believe that the intellectual property rights we may retain from these collaborations  as well as the value we have built in our other research and development programs  may help us initiate other collaborative opportunities 
based on our perception of the level of interest in certain of our programs among some potential collaborators  we believe that we could enter into additional collaborative agreements in that would be material to our business 
our business development priorities include new collaborations to support development and commercialization of vx outside north america and to assist us with the development and commercialization of vx our product and development pipeline also includes drug candidates such as vx and vx bacterial infection  vx sepsis  vx and pralnacasan inflammatory diseases and vx cancer that we may choose to develop with or through a collaborator  as we maintain focus on our core product candidates 
we may also seek collaborators for our kinase  ion channels and other research programs 
clinical development programs we are focusing our preclinical and clinical development investment on vx  vx and vx we are projecting an increase in research and development expense for to a range of million to million 
we expect this increase to be driven by increased clinical investment in these core programs 
we believe that each of these programs requires comprehensive investment to realize its full clinical and commercial value 
we also recognize that development investment at this stage is subject to the considerable risk that any one or more of these compounds will not advance to product registration 
each compound could fail to progress or advance due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes  placing our full investment in the compound at risk 
while we attempt to stage our investments to mitigate these financial risks  drug discovery and development by its nature is a very risky undertaking 
we expect to continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and nonclinical data in each program in and in subsequent years 
manufacturing and supply chain we are focused on implementing the necessary infrastructure and procedures for manufacturing and supplying drug products containing vx  vx and vx for clinical trials and ultimately for the commercial market 
we currently are making a significant investment in our supply chain management  to ensure timely delivery of drug product in accordance with all applicable regulatory guidelines 
we do not currently plan to manufacture vx  vx or vx ourselves 
we rely on networks of third party manufacturers and suppliers worldwide to provide raw materials and to synthesize  tablet  and package our drug candidates for clinical trials 
we currently expect that we will continue to outsource for our commercial supply requirements for our potential products 
we monitor our third party manufacturers and suppliers capabilities to assess their ability to meet our needs efficiently and economically 
however  a delay in manufacture or supply of clinical trial material could delay the completion of a clinical trial or compromise its results  causing a delay in the anticipated launch of a commercial product 
in addition  our significant supply chain investment could be at risk if we do not obtain favorable results in the clinical trials for any of vx  vx or vx financial guidance the key financial measures for which we have provided guidance are as follows loss we expect that the net loss for will be in the range of to million 
this net loss estimate includes an estimated million in stock based compensation expense and an estimated million of restructuring expense as a result of imputed interest charges relating to the restructuring accrual 
revenues we expect that the company s revenue will be in the range of to million in research and development r d expense we expect that r d expense will be in the range of to million for  including approximately million of stock based compensation expense 
sales  general and administrative sg a expense we expect our sg a expense will be in the range of to million for  including approximately million of stock based compensation expense 
cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities we expect cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to be in excess of million at the end of the financial measures set forth above are forward looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially  including the risks and uncertainties that we describe in risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k and in the section below entitled forward looking statements 
contractual commitments and obligations the first part of the following table sets forth commitments and obligations that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december  certain other obligations and commitments  while not required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap to be included in the consolidated balance sheets  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we have presented these items  all of which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business  in the table below in order to present a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
and later total in thousands commitments and obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december  collaborator development loans   convertible subordinated notes   off balance sheet commitments and obligations at december  facilities operating leases     purchase obligation   research and development and other commitments  total contractual commitments and obligations   commitments and obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at december  the collaborator development loans in the table above represent indebtedness to novartis in the amount of approximately million that was advanced under a loan facility established pursuant to the original collaboration agreement with novartis 
loans under the facility were intended to fund early clinical trials of kinase inhibitor compounds that we selected for early development 
in february  we amended the terms of the novartis collaboration agreement 
under the amended agreement  novartis assumed responsibility for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development 
consequently the loan facility providing funding for development activities by vertex was terminated 
outstanding loans that funded amounts either spent or committed to be spent on development activities relating to compounds not selected by novartis will be repayable without interest in may please refer to note o  significant revenue arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding these loans 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of notes and million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding 
we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of both the and notes 
our aggregate annual interest payment obligation is approximately million 
off balance sheet commitments and obligations at december  at december   our future minimum commitments and contractual obligations included facilities operating leases  a purchase obligation and contractual commitments related to our research and development programs 
these items are not required under gaap to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
they are disclosed in the table presented above and described more fully in the following paragraphs in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity at december  the term under our kendall square lease began january  we began making lease payments in may we have an obligation  staged over a number of years  to build out the leased space into finished laboratory and office space the kendall square facility 
the lease will expire in  and we have options to extend for two consecutive terms of ten years each 
the company s future minimum commitments under the kendall square lease for the period commencing january   including lease payments and a construction obligation  are million for  for and  million for and and million for the period thereafter 
these amounts are included in the table above 
we expect to occupy and use for our operations approximately of the kendall square facility 
we have entered into two subleases for the remaining rentable square footage at the kendall square facility to offset our on going contractual lease obligations 
the subleases will expire in and and contain options to extend through and  respectively 
one of the subleases has certain termination provisions beginning in the future minimum committed income from the subleases is million for  million for and  million for and and million for years thereafter 
these amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above 
see note d  restructuring and other expense 
to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
commitments under research and development programs represent contractual commitments entered into for materials and services in the normal course of business 
the purchase obligation referred to above arises under our agreement to purchase a minimum of million of products from invitrogen corporation annually for three years 
we made this commitment in connection with the sale of certain assets of our former discovery tools and services business on march  our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance pay obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not for cause termination under existing employment contracts 
the cash amount for which the company might be liable upon any such termination  based on current executive pay and bonus levels  could range from to million 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  proceeds from the disposition of assets of our discovery tools and services business  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  which is an increase of million from million at december  the increase reflects net proceeds of approximately million from our public offering of common stock  which closed in june  as well as million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans  offset by the net loss of million 
expenditures for property and equipment during the months ended december  were million 
as part of our strategy to manage our long term operating cash needs  we exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  plus interest  in a series of transactions  for approximately million shares of newly issued common stock 
as a result of these exchanges  we incurred a non cash charge of approximately million 
this charge is related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number that would have been issued upon conversion of the notes under their original conversion prices 
at december   we had approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding 
the notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the restructuring accrual of million at december  relates to the portion of the kendall square facility that we do not intend to occupy  and includes build out commitments and other lease obligations  recorded at net present value 
in  we made cash payments of million against the accrual and received million in sublease rental income 
we expect to make net cash payments of approximately million against the accrual in we review our estimates underlying the restructuring accrual on at least a quarterly basis  and the accrual  and consequently any expected future payment  could change with any change in our estimates 
the net decrease of million in deferred revenue for the months ended december  is a result of revenue recognized in related to cash payments received from collaborators  primarily novartis and merck  in previous periods  which were deferred and are being recognized over our period of performance in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
in connection with new collaborations in  we received and recognized as revenue approximately million up front license payments 
we also received million in milestone payments from our collaborators during consistent with our revenue recognition policy  we recognized approximately million of this amount and have deferred recognition of the majority of these milestone payment amounts  which will be recognized over our remaining period of obligation 
in february  we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with novartis 
under the amended agreement  novartis assumed responsiblity for all nonclinical and clinical development of drug candidates that it accepts for development 
consequently  the loan facility established under the original agreement  which provided funding for development activities by vertex  has been terminated 
as permitted under the amended agreement  on june   we gave notice to novartis of our election to develop vx outside of our novartis collaboration 
as a result  we repaid to novartis approximately million of unspent and uncommitted loan amounts relating to vx at december   we had approximately million in remaining loans outstanding under the loan facility 
loans advanced by novartis for the development of collaboration compounds under the original agreement will be forgiven on a compound by compound basis if any such compounds are selected by novartis for development 
all loans not forgiven under the facility will be repayable  without interest  in may we expect to continue to make significant investments in our drug candidates  particularly in clinical trials of vx  vx and vx  in our ion channel and kinase discovery efforts  in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of our product candidates and in supply chain management 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative expenditures in the future and expenses related to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
in and in future periods  the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including repayment of the notes and the notes  will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
we will continue to rely on cash receipts from our existing research and development collaborations  including research funding  development reimbursements and potential milestone payments  and from new collaborations  in order to help fund our research and development efforts 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time 
during we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital transactions 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
to the extent that our current cash and marketable securities  in addition to the above mentioned sources  are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing 
we also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the application of the accounting policies for restructuring and other expense  revenue recognition  research and development expenses and investments  all of which are important to our financial condition and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
restructuring and other expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred  in accordance with sfas as prescribed by sfas  we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of the liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of such subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
for example  we currently have two subleases for portions of the kendall square facility with terms of six and seven years  respectively  and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases 
as a result  we may be exposed to market variability in the future 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
the accrual for restructuring expense of million at december  is related to the portion of the kendall square facility that we do not intend to occupy 
this estimate represents our best judgment of the assumptions and estimates most appropriate in measuring the ongoing obligation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and for revenue arrangements entered into after june   emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and commercialization agreements 
the terms of the agreements typically include payment to vertex of non refundable up front license fees  funding of research and development efforts  milestone payments and or royalties on product sales 
agreements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values or the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
research and development funding is recognized as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
substantive milestones are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured and we have evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations 
substantive milestones are recognized over the period of performance when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured but we do not have fair value for our remaining obligations 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue at the date the milestone is achieved  which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
we evaluate whether milestones are substantive at the inception of the agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the technological and commercial risk that must be overcome as well as the level of effort and investment required to achieve the milestone 
milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
payments received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned 
royalty revenue on our products agenerase and lexiva telzir is recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories  as provided by our collaborator glaxosmithkline  and is recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not historically been significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
research and development costs all research and development costs  including amounts funded by research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  laboratory supplies  contract services  including clinical trial costs  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
to record clinical trial  contract services and other outside costs  we are required to make estimates of the costs incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end  because the third party service periods and billing terms do not always coincide with our period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
altus investment we assess our investment in altus pharmaceuticals inc  which we account for using the cost method  on a quarterly basis to determine if there has been any estimated decrease in the fair value of that investment below its million carrying value that might require us to write down the cost basis of the asset 
if any adjustment to the fair value of an investment reflects a decline in the value of that investment below its cost  we consider the evidence available to us  including the duration and extent to which the decline is other than temporary 
if the decline is considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have not identified facts or circumstances which would cause us to determine that the investment basis of our interest in altus should be changed 
altus completed an initial public offering in january we own  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
in addition  we hold  shares of redeemable preferred stock  which are not convertible into common stock and which are redeemable at our option on or after december   or by altus at any time 
we are restricted from trading altus securities for a period of six months following the initial public offering 
due to the public offering  in we will classify the common stock as an available for sale investment and record it at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  until such gains and losses are realized 
we will continue to account for the warrants under the cost method of accounting until the end of the restricted trading period  at which time the warrants will be classified as derivatives 
gains or losses on the fair market value of the warrants  as derivatives  will be included in the consolidated statements of operations 
we will continue to account for the redeemable preferred stock under the cost method of accounting 
results of operations the following discussion of revenues and expenses is based only on the results of our continuing operations 
we sold the assets of our discovery tools and services business in two independent transactions in march and december in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 the results of operations associated with the assets sold have been reclassified in the company s consolidated financial statements under the heading discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  the reclassification of the amounts to discontinued operations was accomplished using estimates and assumptions we have deemed appropriate based upon the information currently available 
amounts reclassified to discontinued operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the discovery tools and services business operated on a stand alone basis during the periods presented 
as a result of the disposition of these assets  we now operate in a single operating segment pharmaceuticals 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of  or per basic and diluted common share 
our loss in includes restructuring expense of  and a charge of  for the exchange of newly issued common stock for a portion of our outstanding convertible notes 
our loss in includes restructuring expense of  and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of our net loss for  as compared with our net loss for  increased primarily as a result of increased development investment to advance our propriety drug candidates  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue 
total revenues increased to  in compared to  in in  revenue was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative and other research and development revenues  as compared with  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenue in royalties consist of lexiva telzir fosamprenavir calcium and agenerase amprenavir royalty revenue 
fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name lexiva in the united states and telzir in the european union 
royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
we began earning royalties on sales of lexiva in the united states in the fourth quarter of and on telzir in the european union in third quarter of the increase in royalty revenue is due to the increase in lexiva telzir sales 
by the end of  lexiva had largely replaced agenerase in worldwide markets 
as a result  we expect that royalty revenue in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of lexiva telzir royalty revenue 
we pay a royalty to a third party on sales of agenerase and lexiva telzir 
collaborative and other research and development revenues increased  or  in as compared with the increase in collaborative and other research and development revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements in and in in we entered into collaboration agreements with avalon pharmaceuticals license  development and commercialization of vx and glaxosmithkline research  license  development and commercialization of vx 
under these new collaboration agreements  in we earned  in up front license fees from avalon and  in up front license fees from glaxosmithkline 
in we entered into collaboration agreements with cfft cystic fibrosis drug discovery  mitsubishi pharma corporation far east development and commercialization of vx  and merck research  development and commercialization of aurora kinase inhibitors  including vx and vx 
we recognized revenue of approximately  in from two milestone payments made by merck in our aurora kinase inhibitor collaboration  one made in connection with merck s selection of vx as a follow on compound to vx  and one for demonstrating that administration of vx to patients had an effect on a clinically relevant biomarker  in an aggregate amount of million 
we earned million in milestone revenue from kissei related to the completion of regulatory filings in preparation for phase i clinical development of vx in japan 
the table presented below is a summary of revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended as compared with the year ended in thousands collaborative and other research and development revenues summary of revenues from collaborative arrangements novartis   merck   glaxosmithkline  cfft   other   total collaborative and other research and development revenues  we expect that collaborative and other research and development revenues will continue to be a significant component of our total revenues and we are seeking to enter into additional collaboration agreements in that could be material to our business 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  in  from  in the increase in research and development expenses in as compared with is primarily a result of investment in our clinical development programs for vx and vx development expenses accounted for  or  of the aggregate increase in research and development expenses 
in we incurred costs from phase ii enabling activities for vx  we completed enrollment in a patient phase ii clinical trial of vx for the treatment of ra  and we continued a phase iib clinical trial called the metro trial of merimepodib vx for the treatment of hcv infection 
we initiated the metro trial during during we also completed a phase ia trial of vx  and began a phase ib evaluation of vx in patients with chronic hcv infection 
during the fourth quarter of we commenced phase ii clinical development of vx in psoriasis 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits  laboratory supplies  contractual services and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
set forth below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for the months ended december  and in thousands change change research expenses salary and benefits    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services    infrastructure costs    total research expenses    development expenses salary and benefits    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services    infrastructure costs    total development expenses    total research and development expenses salary and benefits    laboratory supplies and other direct expenses   contractual services    infrastructure costs    total research and development expenses   to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
we expect research and development expenses in to be greater than in due to increased investment in clinical development as we advance our core programs 
in  we expect to focus our preclinical and clinical development investment on vx  vx and vx however  our anticipated research and development expenses could vary materially from our projections  depending on the occurrence and timing of clinical trials and actual clinical trial results 
we expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the advancement of our lead drug candidates 
we do not expect that our research expenses will increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new research collaborations 
we estimate that it takes to years  or possibly longer  to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the us as outlined below phase objective estimated duration discovery lead identification and target validation to years preclinical initial toxicology for preliminary identification of risks for humans  gather early pharmacokinetic data to years phase i evaluate safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs to years phase ii establish effectiveness of the drug and its optimal dosage  continue safety evaluation to years phase iii confirm efficacy  dosage regime and safety profile of the drug  submit new drug application to years fda approval approval by the fda to sell and market the drug for the approved indication months to years animal and other nonclinical studies typically are conducted during each phase of human clinical trials 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical  nonclinical and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase ii and phase iii clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in for the twelve months ended december   we recorded net restructuring expense of million 
this net expense includes a million credit to the restructuring accrual made when we decided in mid to occupy and use a portion of the kendall square facility for our operations  which was offset by i the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligations associated with the portion of the kendall square facility that we do not intend to occupy and ii imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability 
the activity related to restructuring expense for the twelve months ended december  is as follows in thousands accrual as of december  cash payments  twelve months ended dec

 lease restructuring expense     in accordance with sfas  we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the kendall square lease on at least a quarterly basis  and will make whatever modifications we believe necessary until the termination of the lease  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
our estimates have changed in the past  and may change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time 
interest income increased approximately  to  in from  in the increase is mainly the result of higher returns on invested funds 
interest expense decreased  or to  in from  in as a result of the exchange of newly issued stock for a portion of our outstanding convertible debt in the second half of in addition  as a result of the issuance during of common stock in exhange for convertible subordinated notes  we recorded a non cash charge of  this charge relates to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms

total revenues increased to  in compared to  in in  revenue was comprised of  in royalties and  in collaborative and other research and development revenues  as compared with  in royalties and  in collaborative research and development revenues in royalties consist of lexiva telzir fosamprenavir calcium and agenerase amprenavir royalty revenue 
fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name lexiva in the united states and telzir in the european union 
royalty revenue is based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
we began earning royalties on sales of lexiva in the united states in the fourth quarter of and on telzir in the european union in the third quarter of collaborative and other research and development revenues increased  or  in as compared with the increase in collaborative and other research and development revenues is due to the execution of new collaboration agreements and recognition of revenue in the amount of approximately million from a million milestone payment made in connection with novartis selection of vx for development 
we also earned  in milestone revenue from glaxosmithkline relating to regulatory approval of telzir in the european union and the initiation of phase ii clinical trials for brecanavir vx

in  we engaged in development activities with drug candidates targeting potential therapeutic indications other than viral and inflammatory diseases  including vx oncology  which is now licensed to avalon and vx oncology  which is now licensed to merck 
during  we initiated the metro trial 
we completed a phase ia trial of vx  also for the treatment of hcv infection  and began a phase ib evaluation of vx in patients with chronic hcv infection 
during the fourth quarter of we also commenced phase ii clinical development of vx in psoriasis

pharmaceutical company and advancing our product candidates to market  we will continue investing in  and building  industry leading capabilities in research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  we will retain principal responsibility for the development and commercialization of some of our proprietary compounds in certain major markets  and concentrate a significant part of our resources on those drug candidates  collaborations will continue to be a key component of our corporate strategy and we will rely on collaborators to conduct development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates either worldwide or in markets upon which we currently are not focused  at the present time we will concentrate most of our drug development resources on three compounds vx  vx and vx  our losses will continue for the foreseeable future  and our net loss in will be in the range of to million  including an estimated million in stock based compensation expense and million of restructuring expense  our research and development expense for will be in the range of to million  including approximately million of stock based compensation expense  our revenues will be in the range of to million in  our sg a expense for will be in the range of to million  including approximately million of stock based compensation expense  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be in excess of million at the end of  we may enter into new collaborative arrangements in that could be material to our business including research collaboration agreements  a collaboration agreement for the development of vx outside of north america  a collaboration agreement to assist us with development and commercialization of vx  and we may consider entering into collaborative relationships to further develop vx  vx  vx  vx  vx  pralnacasan and or merimepodib  we will continue to add promising potential products to our development pipeline  which will be focused on a wide variety of diseases and conditions  including cancer  cystic fibrosis and pain  we will seek to opportunistically license and acquire technologies  resources and products that have the potential to strengthen our drug discovery platform  product pipeline and commercial capabilities  therapeutics such as vx that target hcv viral replication may significantly increase the number of patients who achieve a sustained viral response to drug therapy  treatment with vx could result in improved sustained virologic response rates and a more favorable adverse event profile  our completed toxicology studies will support clinical trials of vx of up to three months duration  it may be possible to achieve sustained virologic response by including vx in a treatment regimen of approximately weeks duration and subject to fda agreement  we will initiate a three month phase ii clinical trial of vx that will include a comparison to the current standard of care in hcv therapy in more than hcv patients in the second quarter of  we will initiate additional clinical trials of vx in  including a phase ii trial in patients that have failed prior therapy  data from the phase ib combination therapy trial of vx will be presented at a medical conference in  vx may be a potent and attractive therapy for ra  we will file an ind application with the fda in to support clinical trials of vx in the united states  we will initiate clinical trials of vx on a background of methotrexate  including a three month dose ranging phase ii clinical trial in more than patients with ra by mid  we will file an ind and initiate our first clinical trial of vx in the first half of  kinase inhibition may offer a therapeutic opportunity against a broad range of human tumors  data from nonclinical studies with pralnacasan will be presented at a medical conference in  we will complete the metro trial in  but will not conduct additional merimepodib clinical trials after that  the results of glaxosmithkline s phase iia and iib clinical trials of brecanavir will be made available in  glaxosmithkline will commence a phase iii clinical trial program for brecanavir vx in  merck will report phase i clinical data for vx in  and will also commence phase ii clinical development of vx during  glaxosmithkline will initiate phase i clinical development of vx early in  our systematic drug discovery approach is increasing the speed and efficiency of drug design efforts directed at novel biological targets and is securing valuable intellectual property  our ongoing research programs  particularly those directed at the kinase and ion channel gene families  will continue to create potential value for vertex by generating new product candidates in areas of significant unmet medical need  we will use our proprietary gene family based platform and experience in structure based drug design to pursue targets in other medically important gene families  funds from our anticipated sources will be adequate to fund our planned activities for at least the next eighteen months from the date of filing  we will significantly augment our manufacturing  logistics  supply chain and quality assurance resources  we will seek the benefits of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  our facilities are adequate for our future needs  the intellectual property rights that we will retain from our current research collaborations may help us initiate other collaborative opportunities  our increased research and development expense in will be driven by increased clinical investment in certain core programs  we will continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and nonclinical data in each program in and in subsequent years  we will continue to outsource to meet the commercial supply requirements for our potential products and will enter into commercial relationships with multiple suppliers to reduce our supply chain disruption risk  our losses on a quarterly basis and annual basis will continue  royalty revenue in the foreseeable future will consist primarily of lexiva telzir revenue  we will incur substantial expenditures relating to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights  we will continue to rely on cash receipts from our existing research and development collaborations  including research funding  development reimbursements  and potential milestone payments  and from new collaborations to meet our future operating and capital requirements  our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support advancement of our lead drug candidates  our research expenses will not increase significantly unless we obtain a significant amount of funding from new research collaborations  it takes to years  or longer  to discover  develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the united states  during we will continue to pursue a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more capital transactions  which may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past  collaborative and other research and development revenues will continue to be a significant component of our total revenues  and our restructuring liability will be as we have estimated  and we will make net cash payments against the million restructuring accrual in of

any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in our discussion in this annual report will be important in determining future results 
while management makes its best efforts to be accurate in making forward looking statements  such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially  including the cautionary information set forth under the heading risk factors appearing in item a of this annual report on form k  which are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no

fasb r revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fasb  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
fasb r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation over the employees service periods 
compensation cost is measured at the fair value of the award at the grant date and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcome of certain conditions 
the fair value of an award is not re measured after its initial estimation on the grant date 
we are required to comply with fasb r beginning january  the effective date 
we will apply the modified prospective method of adoption in our application of fasb r 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on application of the requirements of fasb r to all share based payments granted after the effective date  and b based on application of the requirements of fasb to all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fasb r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by fasb  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method  and therefore generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of fasb r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
in we expect to record approximately million in compensation expense in connection with the adoption of fasb r 
the impact of adoption of fasb r beyond fiscal cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on our stock price and the amount of share based awards granted in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
however  had we adopted fasb r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the effect of fasb as described in stock based compensation found in note b to our consolidated financial statements

we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
on january  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and vertex has implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of its investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
