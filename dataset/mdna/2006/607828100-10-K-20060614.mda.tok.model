item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
founded in  the company is in its th year of operation with a long history of profitability 
we operate on continents  in countries  with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in automobiles  light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems  off highway and industrial equipment 
our products are also in fuel cell applications and electronic equipment 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  exhaust gas recirculation egr coolers  and electronics cooling solutions 
consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche highway  off highway and industrial end markets 
we will achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
in order to reach our goal  our strategy is diversification by geography and by end market 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and  operational and financial discipline for improved profitability and long term stability 
development of new products and technologies for increasingly diverse end markets our heritage and a current competitive strength is our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new  emerging markets 
we own three global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the united states  in bonlanden  germany  and in asan city  korea 
our reputation for providing quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with few product warranty issues 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers who recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and are patent protected 
we hold over  patents on our technologies and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 
in general  we spend in excess of million representing over percent of selling  general and administrative expenses annually on our product and technology research and development efforts 
strategic planning and corporate development we employ both a longer term five year and short term strategic planning process enabling us to assess continually our competitive threats and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  both by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
for the most part  we generate our ideas for potential acquisitions internally 
we believe this approach has contributed to our past acquisition successes 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our success from this process has been our expansion activities into the niche hvac and refrigeration markets in the recent past 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
to support this focus we operate our plants using various continuous improvement tools such as kaizen  lean manufacturing  six sigma and others 
we also operate with a small plant philosophy  enabling greater flexibility to manage our asset base  our capacity  and relationships with employees 
we also seek low cost sourcing when and where appropriate 
we are accelerating our efforts in this area as costs for materials and purchased parts rose dramatically in the past months  primarily due to global increases in the metals commodity markets 
to counter these rising materials prices  we have entered into contracts with some of our customers where these rising costs are passed through to them on a lag basis  although we have had a mixed success with this initiative 
in addition  in april  we entered into a hedging strategy to mitigate our exposure to changing aluminum prices  which is our largest materials component 
we follow a rigorous financial process related to all areas of investment and returns  enabling increased profitability and cash flows over the long term 
we employ a value based management financial focus  with particular emphasis on working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals driving past and current improvement in global cash management  debt reduction and access to credit 
this focus has given us the flexibility to capitalize on acquisition opportunities  other investments and joint ventures  research and development  stock buy backs  and dividends 
it also helps us identify and take action on underperforming assets in our portfolio  such as our aftermarket business that was spun off in july our executive management incentive compensation is based on a return on net assets calculation that drives our singular focus for alignment with shareholders interests when it comes to our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees which is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the performance of the company over a time frame greater than a year 
this plan is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards which are based on a mix of earnings per share growth and growth in our stock price 
consolidated market conditions and trends we have experienced unprecedented market conditions over the past year 
our customers are demanding the same high quality products at a lower price 
at the same time  we have experienced dramatic increases in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly copper  aluminum  steel and natural gas 
raw materials represent approximately percent of our cost of goods sold  and approximately to percent of base material increases are subject to pass through to our customers on a lag basis 
this lag period can average a year or more  based on the agreements we have with an individual customer  and our customers are pushing back on our attempts to pass these costs on 
our strategy to mitigate growing cost pressures is to accelerate new product development  and geographic expansion into new and existing niche markets 
as well  we continue to focus on developing new and expanded proprietary technology that is of more value in the marketplace such as our early stage development of fuel cell technology for energy  vehicular and other applications 
we executed on our stated goals of geographic and end market diversification with the acquisition of airedale international air conditioning limited airedale in the united kingdom in may for million 
airedale is a leading designer and manufacturer of specialty air conditioning systems  with calendar revenues of approximately million 
this accretive acquisition provided expansion opportunities in niche refrigeration markets in the uk and in europe  and opened up a new channel for us to provide our existing hvac products in these markets 
we also moved closer to our goal of geographic diversification by completing the acquisition of the remaining percent of radiadores visconde  our brazilian joint venture  in may radiadores visconde provides thermal management solutions to the automotive  truck  agricultural and construction equipment  and industrial application markets  as well as the automotive aftermarket for export and for distribution throughout south america 
it manufactures a wide array of modules and heat exchanger components for oems including radiators  charge air coolers  and oil coolers 
the purchase price totaled approximately million  and included an agreement to pay an additional million based on certain future performance goals 
this acquisition is anticipated to be accretive in fiscal  and it will aid in the geographic expansion of our business 
segment information strategy  market conditions and trends on july   our aftermarket business  formerly reported within the distributed products segment  was spun off on a tax free basis and merged with transpro  inc transpro  which subsequently changed its name to proliance international  inc  was considered the acquirer of the aftermarket business 
our shareholders retained their modine common shares and  in the merger  received of a share of common stock of the newly combined company in exchange for each share of aftermarket common stock issued in the distribution 
subsequent to the merger  modine shareholders owned approximately percent of proliance international s common stock 
the aftermarket business has been presented as a discontinued operation for the periods presented in this report 
as a result of this merger and the elimination of the former distributed products segment  as well as recent organizational changes in group vice president responsibilities  modine expanded its operating segments during fiscal from three segments previously reported to five reportable segments  as follows original equipment americas  original equipment asia  original equipment europe  commercial hvac r and other 
we believe the expanded reporting segment structure reinforces the benefits of market  customer and geographic diversification and product breadth around its core business and technology platform in thermal management 
each of these segments is managed at the group vice president level and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used in evaluating the performance of each business segment  and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily based on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
original equipment americas percent of revenues our original equipment americas segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made by commercial original equipment manufacturers oems  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor home and motor coaches 
it also serves the north american automotive market  as well as the heavy duty and industrial markets  including agricultural  construction and industrial markets  ie lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
a factor with a significant impact on and anticipated fiscal year results is the pre build of us trucks in anticipation of higher emission standards required for diesel engine vehicles built after january  this presents both risks and opportunities 
while we experienced significant growth in truck volumes in fiscal  the volume of trucks that will be built in the us will fall in  as customers have been ordering more vehicles in anticipation of the change the components added to new vehicles will add to the vehicle s cost and reduce its engine efficiency 
this anticipated volume decline will have an impact on our consolidated results in fiscal the change in emissions standards also provides an opportunity for us  as more of our components are required on each vehicle to meet the new standards  thus our content per vehicle is increasing 
additionally  we have increased our share in this market as a result of new business wins 
our north american automotive business has experienced considerable deflationary price pressure from oems  while at the same time the cost of raw materials and purchased parts has increased 
our us competitors are financially challenged  with both dana corporation and delphi corporation filing for us chapter bankruptcy protection  creating additional deflationary price pressure and some excess capacity in the marketplace 
on the positive side of this trend  we have experienced increased opportunities to bid on business that was previously not available to us 
in our heavy duty and industrial business  a positive trend is increased emission standards for agricultural and construction equipment driving increased demand for our components such as egr coolers 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes several components 
first  our strategy is to reposition the segment from a competitive cost position  including reassessing our manufacturing footprint  improving sourcing of raw materials and purchased parts  and other programs intended to increase efficiency and right size capacity 
second  we are focused on reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth 
original equipment asia percent of revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing vehicular climate control systems and powertrain cooling systems to various industrial end markets  the greatest percentage for commercial light truck applications 
these products are sold primarily to korean oems who export a significant portion of korean made vehicles to other countries 
our largest customers are hyundai motor company and kia motors corporation 
competitors include the halla group of visteon corporation  doowon climate control company ltd  samsung electronics  and others 
a significant trend in our asian business is our customers relative emphasis on lower price over better technology  evidenced by significant price reduction demands from hyundai motor and kia motors  our key customers 
on the upside  many parts that we have supplied as separate components are becoming part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
longer term  hybrid automobiles will be mass produced in korea perhaps as soon as this trend and other needs for technological advances  including environmentally friendly cooling components  such as co  should create additional demand for our products 
our strategy and focus in this business is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  diversify our product offering and customer base  and establish manufacturing capabilities in china 
original equipment europe percent of revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain cooling systems and vehicular climate control components to various industrial end markets  including automobile  heavy duty and industrial  commercial light truck  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  heavy duty exhaust gas recycling products  retarders  and hvac condensers 
competitors include behr gmbh co 
kg  valeo  denso corporation  akg  and a variety of other companies 
trends affecting our european automotive business include significant price down demands from our european based customers  price competition from low cost country manufacturing locations  and material cost increases for aluminum  copper brass  steel and energy which have not been offset entirely by pass throughs to our customers 
to offset these difficult market conditions in the short term  we continue our focus on various lean manufacturing initiatives and low cost sourcing 
an additional strategy that could have a longer term benefit on our operations is a recently initiated program to assess our manufacturing footprint 
we believe there is an opportunity to be more cost competitive and grow our business at a higher rate if we expand our operations in lower cost geographic areas 
our auto  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway business has experienced increased pricing pressure from customers  which is expected to continue 
at the same time customer service expectations have increased 
the business experienced strong growth with its medium truck customers and construction machinery customers  while demand for agricultural products was down slightly 
trends going forward  in addition to increased pricing pressure  include consolidation of the customer base and emission legislation that will cause the need for more cooling products and other new products and systems 
the manufacturing footprint is western european focused with the exception of one plant in hungary 
the continued profitability of this business is dependent upon developing a lower cost and more automated manufacturing cost base 
in the interim  management is focused on continuous improvement techniques and the implementation of longer term customer agreements 
commercial heating  ventilating and air conditioning equipment  and refrigeration hvac r percent of revenues our commercial hvac r business provides a variety of niche products in north america  europe  asia and south africa that are used by engineers  contractors and building owners in applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
we manufacture oem coils copper tube aluminum fin coils and all aluminum microchannel coils for heating  refrigeration  air conditioning and vehicular applications 
we also manufacture heating products for commercial applications  including gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  high and low intensity infrared and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products for commercial applications include single packaged vertical units and vertical unit ventilators used in school room applications  computer room air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers and roof top cooling units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
competitors include lennox international heatcraft refrigeration products  eco  thomas betts reznor  mestek inc sterling  emerson electric company liebert hiross  united technologies corporation carrier and johnson controls  inc york 
revenues have increased primarily due to the acquisition of airedale in fiscal however  the segment has grown organically as well  due to growth in coil sales 
margins in this business have been negatively affected by increased commodity costs a trend which is expected to continue 
economic conditions  such as demand for new construction  are drivers of demand for the heating and cooling products 
other percent of revenues the other segment is comprised of our electronics cooling and fuel cell businesses 
the electronics cooling business develops and manufactures custom thermal management solutions for electronics oems worldwide 
with facilities located in north america and the united kingdom  we offer customers global design and manufacturing support 
our broad product offering includes heat pipes round  flat bent  and vapor chambers  heat pipe assemblies embedded and remote  heat sinks  cold plates  heat exchangers liquid to air and air to air  liquid cooling systems  and advanced technologies such as loop heat pipes 
we serve a diversified set of markets and industries that include high performance computing server storage embedded  communications  power  military aerospace  medical  automotive  and transportation 
the markets we serve are expected to grow at a mid single digit compounded annual growth rate 
these trends are favorable because the thermal requirements of the end product continue to drive greater demand for heat pipes  heat pipe assemblies  and other advanced solutions 
to improve past performance issues in the electronics cooling business  new management was put in place during the fiscal year  and the company moved to reassess the business and its prospects 
our strengths are based on a strong tradition for innovation  product performance and breadth of product lines 
our primary weakness is our cost position 
near term  the new management team is focused on improving manufacturing processes and control  expanding into selected new markets  and improving new product lead times 
as part of this reassessment process  management determined that the taiwan facility  which manufactures heat pipes for personal computer and laptop markets  was not competitive from a cost perspective in these commodity based markets 
accordingly  in may we announced the closure of this facility  which is anticipated to be completed by the end of august in conjunction with the closure  the company anticipates it will incur approximately million of costs related to severance  lease termination  and other closure costs  of which million represents anticipated cash payments 
our fuel cell business is a developmental stage enterprise supporting the highly complex thermal management needs of fuel cell system developers and the thermal dynamic processes used in the production of hydrogen fuel processing  electric devices stationary power  and vehicle engines 
as macro economic trends have shifted causing increased development of alternatives to oil based fuel  we have intensified our activity in this business 
we are not aware of any competitor of ours that has the same level of focus on this market 
due to increased global demand for fuel cell technology  driven by demand for a sustainable  environmentally sound and independent means of power  we believe demand for our products will increase 
outlook the challenging market factors that existed during the second half of fiscal are anticipated to continue to significantly impact the business into fiscal  including ongoing raw material  energy and health care cost increases  as well as continued pressure from oems for price downs on our products 
we also expect to be operating in the fourth quarter of fiscal with lower demand for truck components  as market demand potentially slows as a result of the pre buy of diesel engines used exclusively in us trucks in anticipation of higher us emissions standards that will be implemented on january  we also anticipate continued challenges through aggressive competition  softer korean and chinese economies  and reduced volumes for certain automotive vehicle platforms 
fiscal will be positively impacted by a strong line up of new business programs and the accretive acquisitions of radiadores visconde in may and airedale in may we intend to remain focused on our strategies of developing new products and technologies  expanding into new markets and geographies and reducing our costs 
these strategies and actions in fiscal and beyond will make us a more cost competitive  innovative and efficient technology provider to our current and future customers 
in fiscal and beyond  we will be implementing repositioning plans with a goal of making the company more efficient 
we are examining our manufacturing footprint as well as our cost structure 
as we implement these plans  we will incur certain expenditures related to the execution of these repositioning efforts 
consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal revenues were a record billion  representing an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal the growth in revenues was primarily related to acquired revenues from the march acquisition of the heavy duty original equipment business of transpro  inc in jackson  mississippi modine jackson  the may airedale acquisition  and the full year impact of the july  acquisition of the automotive climate control division of winiamando inc in south korea modine korea 
in addition to acquired revenues  the fiscal growth in revenues was also related to increased organic revenues driven by strength in worldwide truck and heavy duty volumes 
earnings from continuing operations remained relatively consistent at million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily offset by higher commodity prices  additional customer pricing pressures and increased selling  general and administrative sg a expenses driven by higher salaries and professional fees 
partially offsetting these increased costs was a decrease in the effective income tax rate based on research and development tax planning strategies implemented during the year 
the following table presents consolidated results from continuing operations on a comparative basis for the years ended march   and years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses and restructuring charges income from operations interest expense other income net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was driven by recent acquisitions as well as growth in organic revenues 
acquired revenues included million related to the may acquisition of airedale  million related to the march modine jackson acquisition  and million related to the july acquisition of modine korea 
organic revenues increased million  driven by strength in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets 
revenues in worldwide heavy duty and industrial markets increased million  as construction and agricultural market demand continued to remain strong during fiscal revenues in us truck markets increased million  related to strong volumes and pre buy activity in anticipation of higher us emissions standards that will be implemented on january  automotive volumes remained relatively consistent year over year  as slight growth in european markets was offset by moderate declines in us markets  based on continued softness experienced in these markets and price down pressures reducing sales prices per unit 
organic commercial hvac r revenues increased modestly  driven by strong coil and condenser sales  especially within the southeastern portion of the us gross profit increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily driven by the growth in sales volume during fiscal  partially offset by material price increases 
despite the increase in gross profit  gross margin decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the primary contributing factor to the decline in gross margin has been the steady increase in raw material prices experienced during fiscal  especially during the third and fourth quarters 
the most significant commodities used in our manufacturing process are aluminum and copper 
aluminum prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal  and copper prices increased percent on average from fiscal to fiscal we have agreements with certain customers to pass through these higher commodity prices to them in our sales price  however  these pass through agreements can lag up to one year behind the actual price increases  or may not provide us the ability to recover the entire material price increase 
these material price increases were the primary factor contributing to the decrease in gross margin  as the material component of cost of sales increased from percent of net sales in fiscal to percent of net sales in fiscal in addition  the decline in gross margin is related to a million property  plant and equipment impairment charge recorded during fiscal within the taiwan operation of the electronics cooling business  and a million charge related to an early retirement program initiated in our korean operation during fiscal sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in sg a was related to the acquired businesses in fiscal and the remaining increase in sg a was driven by higher salaries and other compensation related to headcount increases  a million charge related to the korean early retirement program initiated during fiscal  as well as incremental professional services incurred in conjunction with certain market studies  tax projects  and other process improvement activities 
the increase in gross profit  offset by the increase in sg a expenses  contributed to the million decrease in operating income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal  related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year  partially offset by a reduction in effective interest rate achieved in conjunction with refinancing activities completed during the fiscal year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance the airedale acquisition million and the share repurchase program million 
other income decreased million from fiscal to fiscal this decrease is primarily comprised of a reduction in equity earnings of non consolidated joint ventures and a reduction in foreign currency transaction gains based on differences in foreign currency exchange rates and transactions between fiscal and fiscal these decreases are partially offset by increases in interest income and a million settlement gain recorded during fiscal related to the korean acquisition 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition  the effective income tax rate decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was related to a million research and development tax credit recorded during fiscal  partially offset by million of income tax expense recorded during the year in conjunction with million of cash repatriated to the us from a foreign location under the american jobs creation act of the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the research and development credit and tax on repatriation discussed above  as well as the impact of various state and foreign income taxes 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was partially driven by million of acquired revenues related to the korean acquisition in july and million of acquired revenues related to the march modine jackson acquisition 
in addition  we experienced strong performances in our north american truck and heavy duty markets  as well as the european heavy duty and automotive markets 
gross profit increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit is primarily driven by the growth in sales volume during fiscal despite the increase in gross profit  gross margin decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal contributing factors to the decline in gross margin were the increase in raw material prices  pressure for oem price downs and higher energy costs 
lower gross margins earned in the newly acquired korea operations also led to the decline in the gross margin 
partially offsetting these decreases were improvements in manufacturing overhead and labor costs driven by lower than expected warranty costs related to new program introductions 
sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the increase in sg a was related to the acquired korean operations during fiscal the remaining increase in sg a was driven by higher compensation and related benefit costs  costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher personnel costs as the company expanded its global presence 
the increase in gross profit  partially offset by the increase in sg a expenses  contributed to the million increase in operating income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the provision for income taxes increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily driven by the growth in pre tax earnings 
the effective income tax rate decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily related to a decrease in the valuation allowance requirements in fiscal versus fiscal related to certain foreign tax loss carryforwards 
the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance discussed above  as well as the impact of various state and foreign income taxes 
discontinued operations on july   the company completed the previously announced spin off of its aftermarket business on a debt free and tax free basis to its shareholders and the immediate merger of the spun off business into transpro 
the aftermarket business  which was a part of the former distributed products segment  has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company recorded  as a result of the spin off transaction  a non cash charge to earnings of million  representing the difference between the value modine shareholders received in the new company of million  a function of the stock price of transpro at the closing  and the million in asset carrying value of modine s aftermarket business  and million of foreign currency translation loss recognized at the date of the transaction 
the net assets spun off in the transaction were primarily comprised of inventory  accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment 
as a result of the discontinued operations presentation  the net earnings loss related to the discontinued operations of   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively  has been separately presented in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of earnings loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes 
segment results of operations original equipment americas years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net sales within the original equipment americas segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal  and increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal this segment has experienced strong sales volumes in truck and heavy duty and industrial markets over the years presented 
these strong volumes are attributable to strength in the truck  agriculture and construction markets  as well as high pre buy activity in anticipation of the january  emission regulations primarily within the truck markets 
in addition  the march modine jackson acquisition contributed million toward the fiscal growth in net sales 
partially offsetting these increased volumes were reduced sales within the north american automotive markets over the prior two years  as several automakers have gone through inventory corrections  in part triggered by higher gas prices and a consumer shift from light trucks and full suv s to cars and small suv s 
gross profits have increased correspondingly to the increase in net sales over the past two years 
however  gross margins have decreased from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal this deterioration in gross margin has been driven by the increasing raw material costs over the past two years  as well as continued pricing pressures placed on us by the oems in these markets 
in order to minimize these trends  the company is pursuing a number of action items  including review of foreign suppliers and low cost sourcing of purchases  hedging strategies for commodity prices  especially aluminum  and review of our pass through agreements with our customers 
sg a expenses have held relatively consistent as a percentage of sales within this segment 
the incremental sales volumes and margins in fiscal contributed to the million increase in income from operations from fiscal  resulting in an percent conversion rate on incremental sales volume 
however  this conversion rate was unable to be maintained into fiscal given further accelerated increases of commodity prices and customer pricing pressures  resulting in the million decrease in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal original equipment asia years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales n a n a cost of sales n a n a gross profit n a n a selling  general and administrative expenses n a n a income from operations n a n a modine korea was acquired by the company in july in its seven months of results in fiscal  modine korea recorded a slight decline from pre acquisition levels in sales and reduced operating income  primarily due to the launch of new programs with tighter margins resulting directly from increased market pricing pressure 
in addition  an administrative office was opened in shanghai  china to support growth in the asian markets  which contributed to reduced operating income 
modine korea s fiscal sales were positively impacted by exchange rate changes of million during fiscal  but remained relatively consistent on a local currency basis 
operating results were slightly reduced from fiscal on an annualized basis  primarily related to the softening of the korean economy which has led to greater competition in the domestic vehicle market  increasing the pricing pressure on the supply base 
in addition  material prices have also adversely impacted the income from operations 
during fiscal  an early retirement program was initiated in korea  which resulted in a million charge recorded during the year 
this charge further contributed to the reduction in income from operations 
original equipment europe years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net sales within the original equipment europe segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal approximately million of this increase came from growth in the heavy duty market  which has experienced strong sales volumes within agriculture and construction products 
the remaining fiscal increase of approximately million related to strong customer programs within the european automotive markets  partially offset by a million decrease related to exchange rate changes 
during fiscal  the million  or percent increase in net sales was primarily driven by growth in the heavy duty market  which continued to show strength similar to the prior year 
automotive sales increased in fiscal  but at a much slower pace than that experienced in the prior year 
the european automotive market is showing signs of increased competitive pressures and price down pressures from customers  which contributed to the slowing growth in these markets during fiscal gross profits have increased correspondingly to the increase in net sales over the past two years 
in addition  gross margins have increased from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal and this improved gross margin from fiscal to fiscal and fiscal is related to the high sales volumes and favorable conversion costs generated over the past two years  especially within the heavy duty markets 
however  the automotive markets have shown a slight deterioration in gross margin in fiscal driven by the increasing raw material costs as well as increased pricing pressures placed on us by the oems in these markets during the current year 
these pricing pressures are anticipated to accelerate into fiscal sg a expenses were held consistent from fiscal to fiscal on a larger sales base  resulting in a reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales within this segment 
the incremental sales volumes and margins in fiscal and fiscal contributed to the million increase in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal  and the million increase in income from operations from fiscal to fiscal commercial hvac r years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net sales within the commercial hvac r segment increased million  or percent  from fiscal to fiscal  and increased million  or percent from fiscal to fiscal the majority of the current year increase is related to the airedale acquisition that contributed million of net sales during fiscal in addition  strong coil and condenser sales  especially in southeastern portions of the us related to hurricane katrina  also contributed to the fiscal increase in net sales 
gross profits have increased correspondingly to the increase in net sales over the past two years 
however  gross margins have decreased over this period from percent in fiscal  to percent in fiscal lower gross margins earned in the newly acquired airedale operations were the primary factor leading to the decline in the gross margin from fiscal to fiscal modest commodity pricing pressures for certain component products have also contributed to the reduction in gross margins over the past two years 
sg a expenses increased million from fiscal to fiscal  primarily driven by incremental sg a expenditures absorbed in the airedale acquisition 
the million increase in income from operations in fiscal was driven by the accretive airedale acquisition  however at a lower operating margin percentage 
other years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations the other segment is comprised of the electronics cooling business and the fuel cell business 
the reduction in sales  gross profit and income from operations is primarily driven by weaknesses experienced in the electronics cooling market 
sales volumes within this business have continued to struggle  and operating performance problems coupled with significant competitive pricing pressures have contributed to the reduction in income from operations  especially within the commodity heat pipe markets 
during fiscal  an impairment charge of million was recorded within this segment related to the taiwan operation of the electronics cooling business given the operating losses and market pressures impacting this business 
on may   we announced the closure of the taiwan facility  which is anticipated to be completed by august  the closure of this facility will result in a pre tax charge of approximately million during fiscal  related to severance  lease termination costs and other facility closure costs 
this closure will provide management the opportunity to focus our attention and manufacturing assets to better serve the advanced thermal solutions portion of the electronics cooling market 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under lines of credit provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
the company expects to meet its future operating  capital expenditure and strategic acquisition costs primarily through a combination of these sources 
for the sixth consecutive year  cash flows from operating activities exceeded million 
as a result  the company ended the fiscal year with a solid balance sheet and financial position  providing the company with the ability to fund various key programs and pursue growth opportunities while preserving financial flexibility 
the company expects cash flows to remain strong in fiscal while continuing to improve asset utilization 
working capital  which continues to be a key management focus  stood at million at the end of fiscal  sharply lower than the million one year ago  primarily due to the impact from the company s spin off of its aftermarket business completed during the year 
compared with the prior year  days sales outstanding decreased three days to days 
inventory turns increased from to  again primarily due to the impact of the aftermarket business spin off 
cash decreased million to million at fiscal year end 
the ratio of modine s total debt to capital was percent at the end of fiscal compared to percent at the end of fiscal total debt increased million to million  due in large part to the million airedale acquisition and the million the company spent on repurchasing its stock  which is comprised of million acquired through stock repurchase programs and million of treasury stock acquisitions

research and development in fiscal  modine increased its research and development r d spending by percent to million from million one year ago 
investment in r d has increased at an average annual rate of approximately percent since fiscal during fiscal  r d efforts have been focused on new products and technologies to respond to market trends due to environmental legislation as well as energy efficiency and fuel economy 
these key market drivers are shaping and influencing our customers future thermal management needs 
legislation on nox and particulate emissions for diesel engines continues to have a dramatic impact on the operating conditions of our heat exchangers 
as a result  many new heat exchanger and cooling module platforms have been developed and will start to launch in fiscal in order to help our customers comply with this legislation 
likewise  concern over global warming is continuing to cause the industry to consider replacing current refrigerants such as r a with new  environmentally friendly refrigerants such as co a newly formed hvac group has grown out of the r d area 
knowledge developed from r d activities will be used to develop improved hvac product platforms  including products to comply with potential anti idling legislation for heavy vehicles 
energy efficiency legislation is also driving opportunities for high performance  lightweight heat exchangers in commercial markets 
modine continues to refine the product development process for all of its markets  including the use of virtual simulation to increase efficiency and reduce time to market with new designs 
modine ended the year with  worldwide patents  an increase of patents over the prior year 
modine is focused on the long term commercialization of our intellectual property and research  and believes that these investments will result in new and next generation products and technologies 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine s financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including amortized intangibles  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to fair market value based on a discounted cash flow approach and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other factors indicate a need to perform the testing more often 
the company conducts its annual review of goodwill for impairment in the third quarter 
the recoverability of goodwill was determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income were considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 
tooling pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over the program life or years  whichever is shorter  and recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine s pension and postretirement plans are dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  rate of compensation increase  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in health care costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  in addition  the modine salaried employee pension plan was modified so that no service performed after march  will be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula 
at the current pension assumption rates  we would expect pension expense to decline steadily going forward 
timing of these savings could be impacted by an early retirement program announced by the company on may  this program could accelerate  on a short term basis  the company s expenses and liabilities  depending on the number and identity of employees who accept the program 
the company expects to know the extent of this impact prior to filing its quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal we believe the defined contribution plan will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  and e capital market conditions and economic forecasts 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal was percent 
for fiscal  modine lowered the long term rate of return to percent  which resulted in an approximately million impact on fiscal pension expense 
for fiscal  the company excepts to hold this assumption constant at percent  in part because of benefits anticipated from changes the company has made in the administration of plan assets 
the impact of a basis point increase in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million decrease in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of december for fiscal  the company expects to use a discount rate of percent  reflecting no change from fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
in addition  the company changed its mortality table assumption as of the december  measurement date to keep current with overall demographic trends 
this change will result in an increase in the company s expense of approximately million in fiscal a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the health care cost trend rate 
the health care trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company has held that rate constant for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree health care and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
furthermore  beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
a percent increase in the health care trend rate would result in an increase in post retirement expense of approximately  and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate would result in an increase in benefit expense of approximately  other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of certain contingencies and litigation 
accounting pronouncements on october  the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was signed into law 
the jobs creation act provides for a one time percent special dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
under a plan approved by the company s board of directors in december  the company repatriated million pursuant to the jobs creation act 
the company recorded an income tax expense of million associated with the repatriation 
the company has reinvested the proceeds from the repatriation in the company s us operations in accordance with the legislation 
the jobs creation act also provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in between through in addition  the jobs creation act provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
under guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position  application of sfas no

r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal the company intends to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock option awards  and intends to use a lattice based model to determine the grant date fair value of performance awards based on external market indexes 
utilizing these models  the company anticipates that it will record additional compensation expense of approximately million during fiscal under the provisions of sfas no 
r

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated

forward looking statements this report contains statements  including information about future financial performance  accompanied by phrases such as believes  estimates  expects  plans  anticipates  will  intends  and other similar forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of modine s actual results  performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements  because of certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the following customers abilities to maintain their market shares and achieve anticipated growth rates for new products  particularly as they experience pricing pressures and excess capacity issues  modine s ability to maintain current programs and compete effectively for new business  including our ability to offset or otherwise address increasing pricing pressures from our competitors and cost downs from our customers  modine s ability to pass increasing costs  particularly raw material costs  on to our customers in a timely manner and increases in production or material costs that cannot be recouped in product pricing  modine s ability to consummate and successfully integrate proposed business development opportunities and not disrupt or overtax its resources in accomplishing such tasks  the effect of the weather on commercial hvac r market demand  which directly impacts sales  unanticipated problems with suppliers abilities to meet modine s demands  customers actual production demand for new products and technologies  including market acceptance of a particular vehicle model or engine  the impact of environmental laws and regulations on modine s business and the business of modine s customers  including modine s ability to take advantage of opportunities to supply alternative new technologies to meet environmental emissions standards  economic  social and political conditions  changes and challenges in the markets where modine operates and competes including currency exchange rates  tariffs  inflation  changes in interest rates  recession  and restrictions associated with importing and exporting and foreign ownership  the cyclical nature of the vehicular industry  changes in the anticipated sales mix  modine s association with a particular industry  such as the automobile industry  which could have an adverse effect on modine s stock price  work stoppages or interference at modine or modine s major customers  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  including unanticipated warranty claims  unanticipated delays or modifications initiated by major customers with respect to product applications or requirements  costs and other effects of unanticipated litigation or claims  and the increasing pressures associated with rising health care and insurance costs and reductions in pension credit  ability of the company to successfully complete its repositioning efforts and thereby reduce costs and increase efficiencies  and other risks and uncertainties identified by the company in public filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
modine does not assume any obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  economic risk and commodity price risk 
foreign currency risk modine is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign countries 
modine has manufacturing facilities in mexico  south korea  china  brazil and throughout europe 
it also has equity investments in companies located in france  japan  and china 
modine sells and distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company manufactures  distributes and sells it products 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  and changes between the dollar and the south korean won 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the company s foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies are generally reported as a component of shareholders equity 
the company s unfavorable favorable currency translation adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
as of march   the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities 
the carrying value of the debt approximates fair value 
as of march  the foreign denominated  long term debt matures as follows years ending march dollars in thousands thereafterrrr total fixed rate won average interest rate variable rate euro average interest rate in addition to the external borrowing  the company has from time to time had foreign denominated  long term inter company loans that are sensitive to foreign exchange rates 
at march   the company has a billion won  million us equivalent  year loan to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine korea  llc 
on april   the company entered into a zero cost collar to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the entire amount of this loan 
the derivative instrument is being treated as a fair value hedge  and accordingly  transaction gains and losses on the derivative are being recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings and act to offset any currency movement outside of the collar on the outstanding loan receivable 
the derivative instrument expires on august  during fiscal  modine korea  llc paid billion won million us equivalent on this intercompany loan and the company correspondingly adjusted the zero cost collar to reflect these payments 
prior to december   the company s wholly owned german subsidiary  modine holding gmbh had a million euro million us equivalent on demand loan from its wholly owned subsidiary  modine hungaria kft 
for fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded in other income expense transaction gains losses of million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk modine s interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
the company generally utilizes a mixture of debt maturities together with both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings 
in addition  where appropriate  the company may utilize interest rate derivatives 
on august   the company entered into a one month forward ten year treasury interest rate lock in anticipation of a private placement borrowing which occurred on september  the contract was settled with a loss of million 
the loss was reflected as a component of other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to interest expense over the ten year life of the private placement 
at march   million of this after tax loss remained deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes of million 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities 
the carrying value of the debt approximates its fair value  with the exception of the million fixed rate note  which has a fair value of approximately million at march  as of march   long term debt matures as follows years ending march in thousands thereafter total fixed rate won average interest rate fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate variable rate euro average interest rate credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payment according to contract terms 
the company s principal credit risk consists of outstanding trade receivables 
prior to granting credit  each customer is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  past payment experience and credit information 
after credit is granted the company actively monitors the customer s financial condition and developing business news 
approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated in the company s top customers 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
for example  traditionally  significant increases in oil prices have had an adverse effect on many markets the company serves 
continued high oil prices may negatively impact the company s earnings  particularly in the truck and off highway markets 
with respect to international instability  the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
in particular  the company monitors conditions in brazil and the effect on the company s million investment in radiadores visconde which became a wholly owned subsidiary effective may   as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the brazilian real strengthened against the dollar by percent and has strengthened by more than percent over the last three fiscal years 
in addition  the company is focusing more intently on conditions in asia as we continue to integrate our modine korea and china acquisitions 
in fiscal  the won strengthened against the dollar by approximately percent 
the chinese renminbi remained essentially unchanged against the us dollar 
as modine expands its global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 
the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to exhaust gas recirculation  co and fuel cell technology 
in addition  modine s airedale acquisition exposes modine to new specialty air conditioning markets 
modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets emerge 
the upturn in the economy and continued economic growth in china are putting production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of steel and aluminum fin stock serving a more robust market 
as a result  some suppliers are allocating product among customers  extending lead times or holding supply to the prior year s level 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
historically high commodity pricing  which includes aluminum and copper  is making it increasingly difficult to pass along the full amount of these increases to our customers as our contracts have provided for in the past 
beside the purchase of raw materials  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in many instances  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier of such parts being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company offsets this risk with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible but these agreements generally carry annual price down provisions as well 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any one or more of the markets it serves  or a reduction in the company s participation in any one or more markets 
however  the risks associated with any market downturn or reduction are still substantial 
in particular  the company continues to experience negative impact associated with the highly competitive electronics cooling market and automotive markets 
in fiscal  certain property  plant and equipment related to the taiwan portion of the electronics cooling business was deemed to be impaired and a pre tax impairment charge of million was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper and aluminum alloy  and natural gas
