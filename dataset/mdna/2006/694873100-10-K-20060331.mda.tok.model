the products we sell are subject to significant merchandising fashion sensitivity 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise at competitive prices and in adequate quantities that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately in a timely manner to changes in fashion trends could have a material adverse effect on our same store sales results  operating margins  financial condition and results of operations 
misjudgments or unanticipated fashion changes could also have a material adverse effect on our image with our customers 
some of our vendors have limited resources  production capacities and operating histories and some have intentionally limited the distribution of their merchandise 
the inability or unwillingness on the part of key vendors to expand their operations to keep pace with the anticipated growth of pacsun  pacsun outlet  demo and one thousand steps stores  or the loss of one or more key vendors or proprietary brand sources for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to manage our planned expansion effectively 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open and operate stores on a profitable basis and to manage our planned expansion 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our planned expansion  that such expansion will be profitable  or that we will be able to manage our growth effectively 
our planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to locate and obtain favorable store sites  negotiate acceptable lease terms  obtain adequate supplies of merchandise and hire and train qualified management level and other employees 
factors beyond our control may also affect our ability to expand  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending 
any failure to manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will begin operating a new retail concept during fiscal  one thousand steps  which could negatively affect existing operations 
we will commence operations for one thousand steps during april we are currently making final preparations for the initial nine store openings planned for fiscal our ability to make this new retail concept successful is subject to numerous risks  including  but not limited to  i unanticipated operating problems  ii lack of customer acceptance  iii new vendor relationships  iv competition from existing and new retailers  and v lack of sufficient product differentiation 
there can be no assurance that this new retail concept will achieve sales and profitability levels that justify the company s investment in it 
additionally  the expansion of this new retail concept involves other risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company  including  but not limited to  i diversion of management s attention from the company s core businesses  ii inability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  including management and product designers  and iii difficulty in locating and obtaining favorable pacific sunwear of california  inc annual report

sales from proprietary brand merchandise accounted for approximately   and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we may increase the percentage of net sales in proprietary brand merchandise in the future  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve increases in proprietary brand merchandise sales as a percentage of net sales 
because our proprietary brand merchandise generally carries higher merchandise margins than our other merchandise  our failure to anticipate  identify and react in a timely manner to fashion trends with our proprietary brand merchandise  particularly if the percentage of net sales derived from proprietary brand merchandise increases  may have a material adverse effect on our same store sales results  operating margins  financial condition and results of operations 
our comparable store net sales results can fluctuate significantly 
our comparable store net sales results have fluctuated significantly on a monthly  quarterly  and annual basis  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store net sales results  including changes in fashion trends  changes in our merchandise mix  calendar shifts of holiday periods  actions by competitors  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our comparable store net sales results for any particular future fiscal month  quarter or year may decrease 
as a result of these or other factors  our future comparable store net sales results are likely to have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock 
we could lose key personnel at any time 
our continued success is dependent to a significant degree upon the services of our key personnel  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success in the future will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on a single distribution facility exposes us to significant operational risks 
all of our current distribution functions continue to reside within a single facility in anaheim  california 
the company is currently evaluating site selection alternatives for the construction of a second distribution center 
any significant interruption in the operation of the existing distribution facility due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures or other unforeseen causes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our current distribution center will be adequate to support our future growth 
selling merchandise over the internet carries particular risks that can distract attention from our core businesses 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores  ii rapid technological change  iii liability for online content  and iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in addition  internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results  including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell  ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business  in direct competition with us  iii the level of merchandise returns experienced by us  iv governmental regulation  v online security breaches involving unauthorized access to company and or customer information  vi credit card fraud  and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce and the apparel industry 
any terrorist attacks or war threat of war could significantly affect consumer spending 
the majority of our stores are located in regional shopping malls 
any threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events  particularly in public areas  could lead to lower customer traffic in regional shopping malls 
in addition  local authorities or mall pacific sunwear of california  inc annual report 
table of contents management could close regional shopping malls in response to any immediate security concern 
mall closures  as well as lower customer traffic due to security concerns  could result in decreased sales

decreased sales would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign sources of production may not always be reliable 
we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets for our proprietary brands 
in addition  we purchase merchandise from domestic vendors  some of which is manufactured overseas 
we do not have any long term merchandise supply contracts and our imports are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs and quotas 
we face competition from other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity 
we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as i political instability  ii enhanced security measures at united states ports  which could delay delivery of imports  iii imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a region within which we do business  iv imposition of duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  v delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to the failure of foreign source suppliers to comply with applicable import regulations  vi delayed receipt or non delivery of goods due to organized labor strikes or unexpected or significant port congestion at united states ports  and vii local business practice and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity 
new initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions that  if enacted  would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in countries that we do business with 
any inability on our part to rely on our foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure by us to maintain credit facility financial covenants could have a material adverse impact on our business 
a significant decrease in our operating results could adversely affect our ability to maintain required financial ratios under our credit facility 
required financial ratios include a rolling four quarter minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as well as a maximum leverage ratio 
if these financial ratios are not maintained  the lenders will have the option to terminate the facility and require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility  if any 
the alternatives available to the company if in default of its covenants would include renegotiating certain terms of the credit agreement  obtaining waivers from the lenders  or obtaining a new credit agreement with another bank or group of lenders  which may contain different terms 
adverse outcomes of litigation matters could significantly affect our operational results 
we are involved from time to time in litigation incidental to our business 
we believe that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
however  our assessment of current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us not presently known to us or determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact which do not accord with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and there can be no assurance that the market price of the common stock will not continue to fluctuate significantly 
future announcements or management discussions concerning the company or its competitors  net sales and profitability results  quarterly variations in operating results or comparable store net sales  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years

our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors within item a 
executive overview we consider the following items to be key performance indicators in evaluating company performance comparable or same store sales stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or expansion relocation 
we consider same store sales to be an important indicator of current company performance 
same store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage of certain expenses such as store payroll  store occupancy  depreciation  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are somewhat fixed 
positive same store sales results generate greater operating leverage of expenses while negative same store sales results negatively impact operating leverage 
same store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash  and working capital 
net merchandise margins we analyze the components of net merchandise margins  specifically initial markup and markdowns as a percentage of net sales 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
pacific sunwear of california  inc annual report 
table of contents operating margin we view operating margin as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating margins are comparable store net sales  net merchandise margins  and our ability to control operating expenses 
operating margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal   and was  and  respectively 
the operating margin result for fiscal was our highest historical annual operating margin 
for a discussion of the changes in the components comprising operating margins  see results of operations in this section 
store sales trends we evaluate store sales trends in assessing the operational performance of our store expansion strategies 
important store sales trends include average net sales per store and average net sales per square foot 
average net sales per store in millions for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
average net sales per square foot were  and  respectively 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
cash flows from operations for fiscal  and in millions were  and  respectively 
we expect cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance operations without borrowing under our credit facility during fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america necessarily requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the company s retail store locations or upon delivery to and acceptance by the customer for orders placed through the company s website 
we accrue for estimated sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
actual return rates have historically been within our expectations and the reserves established 
however  in the event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
the company records the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognizes a sale when a customer redeems a gift card 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account our estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost is determined using the retail inventory method 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
we base the decision to mark down merchandise primarily upon the current rate of sale and age of a specific item  among other factors 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
store operating lease accounting rent expense from store operating leases represents one of the largest expenses incurred in operating our stores 
we account for store rent expense in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  and fasb technical bulletin  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
accordingly  rent expense under our store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the original term of each store s lease  inclusive of rent holiday periods during store construction and excluding any lease renewal options 
we capitalize rent expense incurred during the build out period of our stores as a component cost of construction and amortize this amount over the life of the related store s lease term once construction has completed  generally upon the commencement of store operations 
beginning in fiscal  we will begin expensing pre opening rent in accordance with fasb staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the company accounts for landlord allowances received in connection with store operating leases in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  and fasb technical bulletin  issues relating to accounting for leases 
accordingly  all amounts received from landlords to fund tenant improvements are recorded as a deferred lease incentive liability  which is then amortized as a credit to rent expense over the related store s lease term 
pacific sunwear of california  inc annual report 
table of contents evaluation of long lived assets in the normal course of business  we acquire tangible and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we use our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on our assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in our business  industry segment  and the global economy  could significantly impact our decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of our long lived assets 
evaluation of insurance reserves we are responsible for workers compensation and medical insurance claims up to a specified aggregate stop loss amount 
we maintain reserves for estimated claims  both reported and incurred but not reported  based on historical claims experience and other estimated assumptions 
actual claims activity has historically been within our expectations and the reserves established 
to the extent claims experience or our estimates change  additional charges may be recorded in the future up to the aggregate stop loss amount for each policy year 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
the combined federal and state income tax expense was calculated using estimated effective annual tax rates 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value through a valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
litigation we are involved from time to time in litigation incidental to our business 
we believe that the outcome of current litigation will not likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and  from time to time  may make provisions for probable litigation losses 
depending on the actual outcome of pending litigation  charges in excess of any provisions could be recorded in the future  which may have an adverse effect on our operating results
