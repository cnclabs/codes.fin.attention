the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing is discussed in detail in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings 

table of contents the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about lease repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financings provide additional information regarding recorded interests 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed within the body of this document 
executive overview was a year of significant progress in many areas 
we completed the consolidation of our eight community banks into three banks  launched an advertising campaign to promote our brand  and announced plans to acquire minotola national bank in new jersey

in  we continued to face challenges with our auto leasing subsidiary  hann 
as a result  throughout most of the year  we worked with a major investment banking firm to explore strategic alternatives with respect to it 
in the end  we decided that for now  it would be in the best interest of shareholders to continue to hold and operate the business  instead of selling the business at a significant discount 
we will  however  continue to monitor and actively manage the business while keeping all of our strategic options open 
because of an expected return to normal lease origination volumes  a reduction in residual value guarantee premiums under contract for the next years  an expected reduction in costs due to a new state of the art reconditioning center by our third party residual value guarantor  recently enacted changes in federal vicarious liability laws that will reduce insurance costs  and the anticipated conclusion of our sale leaseback transaction at the end of  we expect significant improvement at hann in and a return to profitability in at the end of  we also announced that due to the growing trend in the financial services industry not to provide earnings guidance  we were discontinuing the practice going forward

our financial goals for are as follows net interest margin loan growth adjusted for securitizations deposit growth noninterest income growth noninterest expense growth these financial goals include million of securitization gains 
the timing and amount of these associated securitizations  which we use as a funding source and a means to manage capital  are difficult to predict 
consequently  quarterly earnings will fluctuate 
acquisitions minotola national bank on november   we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we will acquire minotola national bank in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of minotola  with total assets of million and fourteen branch locations provides us with an opportunity to expand our franchise into high growth markets in southern new jersey 
under the terms of the merger agreement  for each share of minotola stock held  a minotola shareholder may elect to receive either  in cash  common shares of susquehanna  or a combination thereof such that of the minotola shares would be exchanged for cash  and would be exchanged for susquehanna common stock 
we anticipate that the transaction will be completed by april   pending regulatory approvals 
brandywine benefits corporation and rockford pensions  llc on february   we acquired brandywine benefits corporation and rockford pensions  llc collectively brandywine located in wilmington  delaware 
brandywine is a financial planning  consulting and administration firm specializing in retirement benefit plans for small to medium sized businesses and is a wholly owned subsidiary of brandywine benefits corp  llc  which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of vfam 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and all transactions since that date are included in our consolidated financial statements patriot bank corp 
on june   we completed our acquisition of patriot bank corp patriot 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and all transactions since that date are included in our consolidated financial statements 
other notable events on january   we merged two of our subsidiary banks  first susquehanna bank and trust and wnb bank  into our susquehanna bank pa subsidiary 
on april   we merged three of our subsidiary banks  susquehanna bank  citizens bank of southern pennsylvania  and first american bank of pennsylvania  into our farmers merchants bank subsidiary  which subsequently changed its name to susquehanna bank 
these actions were taken as part of the consolidation plan we first announced in october

supplemental reporting of non gaap based financial measures return on average tangible equity is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable gaap based measure is return on average equity 
we calculate return on average tangible equity by excluding the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average equity 
management uses the return on average tangible equity in order to review our core operating results 
management believes that this is a better measure of our performance 
in addition  this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average equity to return on average tangible equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity efficiency ratio excluding hann is a non gaap based financial measure calculated using non gaap amounts 
the most directly comparable gaap based measure is the efficiency ratio 
we measure our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income  on an fte basis  and noninterest income 
the presentation of an efficiency ratio excluding hann is computed as the efficiency ratio excluding the effect of our auto leasing subsidiary  hann financial 
management believes this to be a preferred measure because it excludes the volatility of vehicle residual values and vehicle delivery and preparation expense of hann and provides better visibility into our core business activities 
a reconciliation of efficiency ratio to efficiency ratio excluding hann is set forth below

table of contents was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  investment securities  and short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and the levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  the rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of noninterest bearing demand deposits and equity capital

for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates 
table illustrates the changes in net interest income caused by changes in average volume  rates  and yields 
the million increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of the net contribution from interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities acquired from patriot in june in addition  since we are an asset sensitive institution  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  we experienced improvement in our net interest margin  from for  to for  due to recent increases in interest rates 
we have  however  reduced our asset sensitivity by offering premium rates on interest bearing deposits  primarily indexed money market accounts  since june  these promotional deposit programs were instituted so that we would continue to be competitive in our marketplace 
variances do occur in the net interest margin  as an exact repricing of assets and liabilities is not possible

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans and leases  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan and lease growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are internally risk rated  using a standard rating system  by our loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan quality personnel 
consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relatively small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 
under our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses  loss rates for the last three years on a rolling quarter to quarter basis are determined for a commercial credits including agriculture  commercial  commercial real estate  land acquisition  development and construction and b consumer credits including residential real estate  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer revolving  and leases 
the loss rates are calculated for each affiliate bank  and they are applied to loan balances of the portfolio segments described above 
in addition to using loss rates  non accrual loans of million or greater are reviewed for impairment as required under fas no 
those loans that have specific loss allocations are identified and included in the reserve allocation 
risk rated loans that are not reviewed for impairment are segregated into homogeneous pools with loss allocation rates that reflect the severity of risk 
loss rates are adjusted by applying other factors to the calculations 
these factors include adjustment for current economic trends  delinquency and risk trends  credit concentrations  credit administration and other special allocations for unusual events or changes in products 
this methodology provides an in depth analysis of the portfolios of our banks and reflects the estimated losses within the various portfolios 
reserve allocations are then reviewed and consolidated 
this process is performed on a quarterly basis  including a risk rated review of commercial credit relationships at the banking affiliates 
prior to  we did not have a standard risk rating system for affiliate banks 
the banks used their own methodology for calculating the allowance  and loss data was not broken out in as many categories  particularly real estate loans  because the data was not available 
table  allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses  reflects comparative data for    and using the revised methodology 
if data were available  and we could retroactively apply our current methodology to  we believe the allocation between the categories of real estate construction and real estate mortgage would be consistent with    and allocations 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given point in time is difficult  particularly during uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in our opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to meet probable loan and lease losses at december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not sustain losses in future periods that could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  
table of contents the provision for loan and lease losses was million for  and million in this million increase in the provision was the result of a million increase in net charge offs in  as compared to the increase in net charge offs was caused by a million net charge off related to one customer in the telecommunications industry 
the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was of period end loans and leases  or million  and  or million  at december  should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers may experience increasing difficulty in meeting their payment obligations  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is our policy not to renegotiate the terms of a commercial loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a commercial loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest income received on impaired commercial loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these impaired loans 
consumer loans are typically charged off when they are days past due unless they are secured by real estate 
loans secured by real estate are evaluated on the basis of collateral value 
loans that are well secured may continue to accrue interest  while other loans are charged down to net realizable value or placed on non accrual depending upon their loan to value ratio 

table of contents table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and not placed on non accrual

prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at december   a decrease from million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of the uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
these loans  which are not included in table  totaled million at december   and million at december  depending upon the state of the economy and its impact on these borrowers  as well as future events  such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
noninterest income noninterest income  as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income  was   and for   and  respectively 
noninterest income increased million  or  in  over this net increase primarily is composed of the following increased asset management fees of million  increased commissions on property and casualty insurance sales of million  
table of contents increased net gains on sales of loans and leases of million  increased net gains on the sales of bank branches of million  increased other income of million  and decreased vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees of million 
asset management fees and commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales 
as part of our strategy to increase other fee based income  we continued to focus on enhancing the wealth management aspect of our business 
as a result  asset management fees increased  as assets under administration at vfam increased  to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase is also due  in part  to our strategic acquisitions 
commissions on property and casualty insurance sales 
the increase in commissions on property and casualty insurance sales is attributed to new business  growth in existing business  and better than expected contingency fee income in the first quarter of gains on sales of loans and leases 
the increase in gains on sales of loans and leases can be attributed to the sale and subsequent securitization of million in home equity line of credit loans helocs in the fourth quarter of the net gain relating to this transaction was million 
net gains on the sales of bank branches 
during  we sold six bank branches and realized an aggregate net pre tax gain of million 
during  we sold four bank branches and realized an aggregate net pre tax gain of million 
these sales were part of our effort to enhance the efficiency of our branch network through our previously announced plans to consolidate and or sell several locations 
other income 
the increase in other income for  is directly related to the inclusion of patriot operations for the entire year 
vehicle origination  securitization  and servicing fees 
the decrease in vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees was primarily due to a combination of decreased lease origination volumes and decreased fees from securitization transactions at hann 
the decrease in securitization fees is due to the current interest rate environment 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased million  or  in  over this net increase primarily is composed of the following increased salaries and employee benefits of million  increased occupancy and furniture and equipment expense of million  increased vehicle residual value expense of million  decreased vehicle delivery and preparation expense of million  and increased other expenses of million  salaries and employee benefits 
the largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which increased in this increase is primarily the result of the patriot acquisition  normal annual salary increases  new revenue producing positions  and higher benefit costs 
offsetting this increase was a decline in related expenses due to our charter consolidations 
on december   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting  effective as of december   of all unvested stock options granted to employees and directors in and the 
table of contents decision to accelerate the vesting of these options primarily was made to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in our income statement in future periods as a result of the adoption of fas no 
r  share based payment  in january we estimate that  as a result of this action  approximately million of compensation expense will have been eliminated in  approximately million of compensation expense will have been eliminated in  and approximately million of compensation expense will have been eliminated in as a result of the accelerated vesting of these options  compensation expense totaling million was included in our results of operations for occupancy and furniture and equipment 
charges for occupancy and furniture and equipment increased in the increase can be attributed to the patriot acquisition and general increases in the costs of doing business  predominantly in the categories of rent expense and maintenance expense 
vehicle residual value 
as we had anticipated  vehicle residual value expense increased for  based upon servicing agreements with auto lenders  our third party residual value guarantor 
however  due to improving market conditions  residual value guarantee premiums are contractually committed to decrease by million in  and by another million in for further information  refer to the discussion concerning vehicle leasing residual value risk on page of this form k 
vehicle delivery and preparation 
the decrease in these expenses is due to efficiencies recognized through the operation of the new reconditioning center at auto lenders 
in addition  fewer vehicle leases matured in other expense 
all other expenses increased million  net see table 
the inclusion of patriot operations since june   contributed to a general increase in all expense categories 
in addition  we incurred increased advertising and marketing expenses relating to our branding initiative in table analysis of other expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands advertising  marketing  and public relations fdic and other insurance legal and consulting postage and delivery all other total income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
during  susquehanna instituted a request under a particular state s voluntary compliance process to establish the right to loss carryforwards 
this process was completed with the state in october  due to the establishment of loss carryforwards in an additional state  as well as other initiatives undertaken during the fourth quarter of  susquehanna has assessed that all of the remaining state net operating losses are realizable at december   and the valuation allowance was released 
offsetting the impact of the release of the valuation allowance was a reduced level of tax advantaged income 

table of contents financial condition summary of compared to total assets at december  and were billion 
loans and leases  as a result of two securitization transactions completed by our banking subsidiaries in  experienced a slight decrease  to billion at december   from billion at december  deposits increased to billion  from billion during the same time period 
equity capital was million at december   or per share  compared to million  or per share  at december  investment securities we follow fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this accounting pronouncement requires the segregation of investment securities into three categories  each having a distinct accounting treatment held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost is recorded in the equity section  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income 
consequently  our total equity was negatively impacted by million  as the unrealized losses  net of taxes  on available for sale securities increased from a loss of million at december   to a loss of million at december  we do not believe any individual unrealized loss represents a material other than temporary impairment 
unrealized losses recorded for us government agencies and mortgage backed securities are attributable to changes in interest rates 
we have both the intent and the ability to hold the securities for a time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
investment securities available for sale decreased million  from december   to december  this decrease occurred because we chose to use some of the cash inflows from sales  maturities  and repayments of securities to fund loan growth rather than reinvest in additional securities 
in addition  the million increase in unrealized losses in the portfolio also contributed to the decrease 
securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement 
presently  we do not engage in trading activity  but we do engage in active portfolio management  that requires the majority of our security portfolios to be identified as available for sale 
while fas requires segregation into held to maturity and available for sale categories see table  it does not change our policy concerning the purchase of only high quality securities 
strategies employed address liquidity  capital adequacy  and net interest margin considerations  which then determine the assignment of purchases into these two categories 
table illustrates the maturities of these security portfolios and the weighted average yields based upon amortized costs 
yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 

table of contents at december   we held no securities of any one issuer where the aggregate book value exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity

table of contents loans and leases in march  our banking subsidiaries entered into a term securitization transaction in which we collectively sold and contributed beneficial interests in a portfolio of automobile leases and related vehicles with an aggregate balance of million 
in december  we entered into a term securitization transaction in which we sold a portfolio of helocs with an aggregate balance of million 
internal growth within the loan and lease portfolio was approximately million 
as a result  loans and leases decreased million  net  from december   to december  in general  we believe that the internal growth that occurred in our loan portfolio in was accomplished through our sales and marketing efforts

these sales were part of our realignment and consolidation project 

table of contents of the net increase in total deposits  million was in brokered certificates of deposit  which are being utilized as an alternative funding source to support the increase in our loan portfolio 
in addition  we redesigned the money management products offered to some of our municipal customers and consequently transferred approximately million in funds that had been invested in securities sold under repurchase agreements into certificates of deposit greater than million 
we do not rely upon time deposits of million or more as a principal source of funds  as they represent only of total deposits

prior to the securitization in december  fhlb borrowings were used to support the increase in our loan portfolio 
the decrease in long term debt was the result of our repayment  at maturity on february   of million aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes

assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalent before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity plus junior subordinated debentures reduced by excludable intangibles 
tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the parent company level as well as at each bank affiliate is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we  and each of our bank subsidiaries  have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
market risks the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
however  in addition to general banking risks  we have other risks that are related to vehicle leasing  asset securitizations  and off balance sheet financing that are also discussed below 

table of contents equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity risk the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiaries had approximately million available to them under collateralized lines of credit with various fhlbs  and million more was available provided that additional collateral had been pledged 
liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity is also evaluated by taking into consideration maturing or readily marketable assets 
unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december  and represented additional sources of liquidity 
as an additional source of liquidity  we periodically enter into securitization transactions in which we sell the beneficial interests in leases and related vehicles to qualified special purpose entities 
most recently  we entered into a term securitization transaction of helocs 
the purchase of these assets is financed through the issuance of asset backed notes to third party investors 
during  net proceeds from these transactions totaled million 
interest rate risk the management of interest rate risk focuses on controlling the risk to net interest income and the associated net interest margin as the result of changing market rates and spreads 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the repricing and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
our goal is to control risk exposure to changing rates within management s accepted guidelines to maintain an acceptable level of risk exposure in support of consistent earnings 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
these methods include basic gap analysis  which points to directional exposure  routine rate shocks simulation  and evaluation of the change in economic value of equity 
board directed guidelines have been adopted for both the rate shock simulations and economic value of equity exposure limits 
by dividing the assets and liabilities into three groups  fixed rate  floating rate and those which reprice only at our discretion  strategies are developed to control the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
our interest rate risk using the static gap analysis is presented in table this method reports the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a specific point in time 
management uses the static gap methodology to identify our directional interest rate risk 
table also illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated as of december  and these estimates include anticipated prepayments on commercial and residential loans  mortgage backed securities  in addition to certain repricing assumptions relative to our core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
static gap analysis is widely accepted because of its simplicity in identifying interest rate risk exposure  but it ignores market spread adjustments  the changing mix of the balance sheet  planned balance sheet management strategies  and the change in prepayment assumptions

table of contents rate risk 
the financial simulation model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities and equity at current and forecasted interest rates  and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on embedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic values of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing embedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit  and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms in addition to general changes in customers needs 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
changes in market rates and general economic conditions will have an impact on an organization s mortgage backed security portfolio 
this will have an associated change on our sensitivity position in changing economic times 
savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice 
a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our floating rate loan portfolio is primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
the portfolio is funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings 
a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes to the different indices resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from such financial instruments 
basis risk is the result of this inconsistent change in the indices  with historical relationships not always being a good indicator 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and economic value of assets  liabilities and equity calculated using certain assumptions we determined as of december   and  at then current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates in and increments 
based upon the current interest rate environment  we believe that interest rates will be flat to a increase in as noted in table  the economic value of equity at risk as of december  is  at an interest rate change of positive  while table discloses that net interest income at risk as of december  is  at an interest rate change of positive 
at december   we were an asset sensitive institution and should benefit from a continued rise in interest rates in  if that should occur

this transaction is subject to fas no 
as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   the unrealized gain  net of taxes  recorded in other comprehensive income was million 
our risk management objective and strategy is to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with future securitizations of auto leases 
we are meeting this objective by entering into forward starting  pay fixed and receive libor interest rate swaps 
the swaps are expected to be effective in hedging the risk of changes in expected future cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of auto leases due to changes in the libor swap rate  the designated interest rate being hedged  over the term of the hedging relationship 

table of contents since the critical terms of the swaps and the hedged forecasted transaction match at inception  and it is probable that the swap counterparty will not default on the swaps  we have concluded at inception that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows 
throughout the life of the hedging relationship  both retrospective evaluations and prospective assessments of hedge effectiveness will be performed at least quarterly 
assuming the hedging relationship qualifies as highly effective  the actual swaps will then be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  and accumulated other comprehensive income will be adjusted to a balance that reflects the lesser of either the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual swaps or the cumulative change in the fair value of a perfect hypothetical swap 
at the date of securitization  the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings when the associated gain on sale from securitization is recognized 
at december   the hedges were assessed as prospectively effective 
in june  we entered into two million interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on million of our variable rate debt 
our risk management objective with respect to this interest rate swap is to hedge the risk of changes in our cash flows attributable to changes in the libor swap rate 
prospective effectiveness evaluations will be performed by qualitatively assessing on an ongoing basis that the critical terms of the swap and hedged transactions still match  and will periodically review the credit quality of the swap counterparty to evaluate whether it is probable that the swap counterparty will not default 
at december   the hedges were considered effective because all the critical terms matched

auto lenders  which was formed in  is a used vehicle remarketer with four retail locations in new jersey and has access to various wholesale facilities throughout the country 
under these arrangements  auto lenders agrees to purchase the beneficial interest in all vehicles returned by the obligors at the scheduled expiration of the related leases for a purchase price equal to the stated residual value of such vehicles 
stated residual values of new leases are set in accordance with the standards approved in advance by auto lenders 
under a servicing agreement with auto lenders  hann also agrees to make monthly guaranty payments to auto lenders based upon a negotiated schedule covering a three year period 
at the end of each year  the servicing agreement may be renewed by the mutual agreement of the parties for an additional one year term  beyond the current three year term  subject to renegotiation of the payments for the additional year 
during the renewal process  we periodically obtain competitive quotes from third parties to determine the best remarketing and or residual guarantee alternatives for hann and our bank affiliates

summary of heloc securitization transaction in december  one of our banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank pa  entered into a term securitization transaction of helocs the heloc transaction 
some of the loans sold were originated by two of our other banking subsidiaries  susquehanna bank and susquehanna patriot bank  and sold to susquehanna bank pa immediately prior to the closing of the securitization 
in connection with the heloc transaction  susquehanna bank pa sold a portfolio of loans with an aggregate total of approximately million to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the transferor 
in the transaction documents for the heloc transaction susquehanna bank pa provides  among other things  representations and warranties with respect to the home equity loans transferred 
in the event that any such representations and warranties were materially untrue with respect to any assets when transferred  the affected loans must be repurchased by susquehanna bank pa 
we provide a guaranty of such repurchase obligation 
the transferor sold the portfolio acquired from susquehanna bank pa to a newly formed statutory trust the issuer 
the equity interests of the issuer are owned by the transferor 
the transferor financed the purchase of the portfolio of helocs from susquehanna bank pa primarily through the issuance by the issuer of million of floating rate asset backed notes to third party investors 
in connection with the securitization  susquehanna retained servicing responsibilities for the loans 
some of the helocs  which generally accrue interest at a variable rate  include a feature that permits the obligor to convert all or a portion of the loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate 
under the transaction documents for the heloc transaction  if the aggregate principal balance of loans converted to fixed rate loans exceeds of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then susquehanna 
table of contents bank pa is required to repurchase converted loans in excess of this threshold until the aggregate principal balance of loans repurchased by susquehanna bank pa for this reason is equal to of the original principal balance of the loans 
if  after giving effect to any repurchase by susquehanna bank pa of loans with converted balances  the aggregate principal balance of fixed interest rate loans exceeds of the aggregate principal balance of the portfolio  then an interest rate protection agreement between the issuer and susquehanna becomes operative 
under the interest rate protection agreement  the issuer will be obligated to make fixed payments  which will be based on the fixed rates of the converted mortgage loans  and we will be obligated to make floating payments  which will be based on the indices of the variable rate mortgage loans 
we do not expect to repurchase any converted loans nor enter into any interest rate protection agreements 
the initial recorded interest only strips for this transaction were million  and the fair value of these interest only strips at december   was million 
in addition  as servicer for these loans  we recorded a servicing asset of million 
the reduction in the interest only strips was expected based upon cash flow estimates for the first collection period 
future monthly amortization of these interest only strips is projected to be significantly less 
summary of vehicle lease securitization transactions in order to facilitate securitizations and other off balance sheet financings  hann formed hann auto trust  a delaware statutory trust the origination trust  in hann purchases vehicles and related leases directly from motor vehicle dealers 
the motor vehicle dealers title these vehicles in the name of the origination trust at the time of the purchase 
titles to the vehicles and the leases are then held by the origination trust  and the origination trust acts as lessor under the leases 
hann initially owns the beneficial interest in all leases and related vehicles 
hann s beneficial interest is often referred to as the undivided trust interest or uti 
hann creates and transfers beneficial interests in the origination trust that represent just the rights in the pool of leases and related vehicles included in securitization  sale leaseback  agency  and other transactions through a special unit of beneficial interest called a subi 
there is no need to undertake the effort and expense of retitling the vehicles because the legal owner of the vehicles  the origination trust  does not change 
at any time  a lease and related vehicle will be allocated to the uti  and then to a subi  if it is beneficially owned by a securitization entity  a third party  or otherwise included in a financing transaction 
in connection with our securitization transactions  we transferred beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles originated by the origination trust to qualified special purpose entities 
hann acts as servicer for the securitized portfolio and receives a servicing fee based upon a percentage of the value of assets serviced 
we do not provide recourse for losses resulting from defaults under the leases 
each securitization transaction also provides that the beneficial interest in any leases and related vehicles that fail to meet the factual representations about those assets made by us in each transaction must be repurchased and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust 
each qspe retains the right to receive excess cash flows from the sold portfolio 
the leases  for accounting purposes  are treated as direct financing receivables as a result of a residual purchase agreement with auto lenders 
although we have not retained residual value risk in the automobile leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders  a qspe may suffer residual losses  which we expect would decrease the value of the interest only strips recognized by us 
as of december   the aggregate amount of all such interest only strips in connection with lease securitizations was million 
in march  each of our wholly owned commercial and retail banking subsidiaries each  a sponsor subsidiary entered into a term securitization transaction 
in connection with this transaction  each sponsor subsidiary sold and contributed the beneficial interest in a portfolio of automobile leases and related vehicles to a separate wholly owned qspe each qspe a transferor and  collectively the transferors 
collectively  the sponsor subsidiaries sold and contributed the beneficial interest in million of automobile leases and related vehicles to the transferors 
however  the transaction documents for the transaction provide  among other things  that any assets that failed to meet the eligibility requirements when transferred by the applicable 
table of contents sponsor subsidiary must be repurchased by such sponsor subsidiary 
each transferor sold and contributed the portfolio acquired from the related sponsor subsidiary to a newly formed statutory trust the issuer 
the equity interests of the issuer are owned pro rata by the transferors based on the value of the portfolio conveyed by each transferor to the issuer 
the transferors financed the purchases of the beneficial interests from the sponsor subsidiaries primarily through the issuance by the issuer of million of fixed rate asset backed notes to third party investors 
the issuer also issued million of notes  which will be retained pro rata by the transferors in the same ratio as the transferors retain the equity interests of the issuer 
the initial recorded interest only strip for this transaction was million  and the fair value of this interest only strip at december   was million 
late in the third quarter of  hann entered into a revolving securitization transaction the transaction

neither hann nor susquehanna provides recourse for credit losses 
however  the qspe s obligation to pay hann the servicing fee each month is subordinate to the qspe s obligation to pay interest  principal and fees due on the loans 
therefore  if the qspe suffers credit losses on its assets  it may have insufficient funds to pay the servicing fee to hann 
additionally  if an early amortization event were to occur under the qspe s loan agreement  hann  as servicer  would not receive payments of the servicing fee until all interest  principal and fees due on the loans have been paid although the servicing fee will continue to accrue 
in connection with the transaction  susquehanna has entered into a back up servicing agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to service the automobile leases and related vehicles beneficially owned by the qspe if hann is terminated as servicer 
if susquehanna were appointed servicer  it would receive a servicing fee each month 
the debt issued in the revolving securitization transaction will bear a floating rate of interest 
in this transaction  the qspe is required to obtain an interest rate hedge agreement if the weighted average fixed interest rate of its assets is less than a targeted portfolio yield calculated monthly and if the funds on deposit in a yield supplement account established by the qspe are less than a targeted amount 
neither hann nor susquehanna has any obligation to obtain such a hedge agreement for the qspe  but the failure of the qspe to obtain the required hedge agreement could be an event of default under its loan documents 
the transaction documents for the revolving transaction contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions and consequences  including events of default  which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold portfolio to meet certain performance tests 
that transaction also provides that any assets that fail to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in that transaction must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust

in june  hann issued a cleanup call to purchase the remaining balance of a transaction 
a cleanup call is issued when the amount of outstanding assets falls to a specified level at which the cost of servicing those assets becomes burdensome 
as a result  hann acquired million in auto leases 
agency agreements and lease sales agency arrangements and lease sales generally occur on economic terms similar to vehicle lease terms and generally result in no accounting gains or losses to hann and no retention of credit  residual value  or interest rate risk with respect to the sold assets 
agency arrangements involve the origination and servicing by hann of automobile leases for other financial institutions  and lease sales involve the sale of previously originated leases with servicing retained to other financial institutions 
hann generally is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors  a servicing fee and  in the case of agency arrangements  an origination fee per lease 
lease sales are generally accounted for as sales under fas during the second quarter of  hann entered into an agency arrangement 
in connection with that arrangement  we entered into an agreement under which we guarantee auto lenders performance of its obligations to the agency client the residual interest agreement 
auto lenders has agreed to purchase leased vehicles in the agency client s portfolio at the termination of the leases for the full residual value of those vehicles 
in the event the agency client incurs any losses  costs or expenses as a result of any failure of auto lenders to perform this purchase obligation  we will compensate the agency client for any final liquidation losses with respect to such leased vehicle 
however  our liability is limited to of the maximum aggregate residual value of all leases purchased by the agency client 
at december   the total residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio for this transaction was million  and our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december   was million 
sale leaseback transaction in december  hann sold and contributed the beneficial interest in million of automobiles and related auto leases owned by the origination trust to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the lessee 

table of contents the lessee sold such beneficial interests to a lessor the lessor  and the lessor in turn leased the beneficial interests in the automobiles and auto leases back to the lessee under a master lease agreement that has an eight year term 
for accounting purposes  the sale leaseback transaction between the lessee and the lessor is treated as a sale and an operating lease and qualifies as a sale and leaseback under fas no 
the lessor is a delaware statutory trust and a variable interest entity a vie 
the lessor held the beneficial interest in vehicles and auto leases with a remaining balance of approximately million at december  to support its obligations under the master lease agreement  at closing the lessee pledged the beneficial interest in an additional million of automobile leases and related vehicles  which were also sold or contributed to the lessee 
at december   the beneficial interest in additional automobile leases and related vehicles pledged by the lessee was million 
under the sale leaseback transaction discussed above  the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences that become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event 
after an early amortization event  the lessee can no longer make substitutions under the master lease agreement  which means that the sales proceeds from the sold vehicles following termination of the related auto leases may not be used to purchase replacement vehicles and leases 
instead  the sales proceeds and other amounts are used to make termination and other related payments under the master lease agreement  which would reduce the income the lessee is expected to earn over the term of the master lease agreement 
these termination and other related payments are amounts sufficient to permit the lessor to repay its outstanding debt  including any necessary makewhole amounts  to return to the lessor s equity investors their invested capital  and to compensate the lessor s equity investors for their early return of cash and their loss of tax benefits 
any termination with respect to particular vehicles would relieve the lessee from the obligation to pay rent with respect to that vehicle 
makewhole amounts would be necessary only if the level of interest rates were lower at the time of the termination payment than the level of interest at the commencement of the transaction 
in addition  if the lessee were unable to substitute new vehicles for terminated vehicles  we would be entitled to take depreciation deductions for tax purposes on the vehicles that were not substituted 
we believe that the likelihood of occurrence of any early amortization event is remote 
the precise amount of these termination and other related payments is subject to a great deal of variability and depends significantly on future interest rates  the sales proceeds for the respective vehicles  the termination dates at which consumer leases terminate  and the length of the remaining term of the master lease agreement at the time of the early amortization event 
it is virtually impossible to calculate the amount of these termination payments 
even if an early amortization event were to occur  susquehanna would expect that the present value of these payments would not exceed the present value of the rent avoided and tax benefits gained by a material amount 
an early amortization event includes the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests or the failure of susquehanna to continue to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
in addition  if susquehanna fails to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings  then susquehanna must obtain a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction to secure its obligations under the guarantee discussed below 
at the end of the lease term under the master lease agreement  the lessee has agreed to act as a remarketing agent for the lessor if the lessor decides to sell the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles 
the lessee has agreed that  if the aggregate net proceeds of such sale are less than the lease end value of the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles at that time  the lessee will pay to the lessor the excess  if any  of the lease end value over the aggregate net proceeds of such sale 
lease end value is the lower of i the aggregate wholesale clean value of the vehicles as shown in the black book official used car market guide monthly or ii million 
if the leases and related vehicles were to be worthless at such time  the maximum exposure to susquehanna and its subsidiaries under these provisions would be million 
the servicing agreement with auto lenders does not apply to the sale leaseback transaction 
under the master lease agreement  the lessee has an early buyout option on january  the ebo date under which the lessee can repurchase all  but not less than all  of the beneficial interests in leases and 
table of contents related vehicles 
if the option is exercised  the lessee will pay to the lessor the purchase price under the early buyout option the ebo price 
the ebo price may  at the lessee s option  be payable either on the ebo date or  if our senior unsecured long term debt rating on the ebo date is at least baa and not on negative credit watch with negative implications by moody s and bbb by standard poor s and not on credit watch with negative implications and certain other conditions are met  in installments 
the lessee must also pay the out of pocket costs and expenses including all transfer taxes and legal fees and expenses incurred by the lessor  the trustees and their affiliates in connection with such purchase 
servicing fees under the securitization transactions  the sale leaseback transaction  agency agreements  and lease sales servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets 
the servicing fees paid to hann under the lease securitization transactions  the sale leaseback transaction  agency agreements  and lease sales approximate current market value 
hann has not recorded servicing assets nor liabilities with regard to those transactions  because its expected servicing costs are approximately equal to its expected servicing income 
the parent company acts as servicer for securitized helocs and has recorded a servicing asset of million based on the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
overall however  we enter into securitization transactions primarily to achieve low cost funding for the growth of our loan and lease portfolio and to manage capital  and not primarily to maximize our ongoing servicing fee revenue 
in the future  in regard to lease securitizations  if servicing costs were to exceed servicing income  we would record the present value of that liability as an expense 
our policy regarding the impairment of heloc servicing assets is to evaluate the assets based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
fair value is based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount 
summary of susquehanna s potential exposure under off balance sheet financings as of december  sale leaseback transaction under the existing sale leaseback transaction  we guarantee certain obligations of the lessee  which is a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of hann 
if we fail to maintain our investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings  then we must obtain a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction to secure our obligations under the guarantee 
we also have obtained from a third party an million letter of credit for the benefit of an equity participant if we fail to make payments under the guarantee 
additionally  as discussed above  the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences that become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event  as described above 
the precise amount of the termination and other related payments is subject to a great deal of variability and depends significantly on future interest rates  the sales proceeds for the respective vehicles  the termination dates at which consumer leases terminate  and the length of the remaining term of the master lease agreement at the time of the early amortization event 
it is virtually impossible to calculate the amount of the termination payments 
even if an early amortization event were to occur  we would expect that the present value of these payments would not exceed the present value of the rent avoided and tax benefits gained by a material amount 
we believe that the occurrence of any early amortization event is remote 
at the end of the lease term under the master lease agreement  the lessee has agreed to act as a remarketing agent for the lessor if the lessor decides to sell the beneficial interest in the leases and related 
table of contents vehicles 
the lessee has agreed that if the aggregate net proceeds of such sale are less then the lease end value of the beneficial interest in the leases and related vehicles at that time  the lessee will pay to the lessor the excess  if any  of the lease end value over the aggregate net proceeds of such sale 
if the leases and related vehicles were to be worthless at such time  the maximum exposure to susquehanna and its subsidiaries under these provisions would be million 
agency agreements and lease sales under the agency arrangements  our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december   was million

summary of compared to results of operations net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over net income of million 
net interest income increased to million for  from million in our earnings performance continued to be enhanced by improvements in non interest income  which  during the year  equaled of total revenues and increased million over non interest expenses increased  to million for  from million for additional information is as follows twelve months ended december  diluted earnings per share return on average assets return on average equity return on average tangible equity efficiency ratio efficiency ratio excluding hann supplemental reporting of non gaap based financial measures susquehanna has presented a return on average tangible equity  which is a non gaap financial measure and is most directly comparable to the gaap measurement of return on average equity 
for purposes of computing 
table of contents return on average tangible equity  we have excluded the balance of intangible assets and their related amortization expense from our calculation of return on average tangible equity to allow us to review the core operating results of our company 
this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
a reconciliation of return on average tangible equity to return on average equity is set forth below 
return on average equity gaap basis effect of excluding average intangible assets and related amortization return on average tangible equity susquehanna has presented an efficiency ratio excluding hann  which is a non gaap financial measure and is most directly comparable to the gaap presentation of efficiency ratio 
we measure our efficiency ratio by dividing noninterest expenses by the sum of net interest income  on an fte basis  and noninterest income 
the presentation of an efficiency ratio excluding hann is computed as the efficiency ratio excluding the effects of our auto leasing subsidiary  hann 
management believes this to be a preferred measurement because it excludes the volatility of full term ratios  securitization gains  and residual values of hann and provides more focused visibility into our core business activities 
a reconciliation of efficiency ratio excluding hann to efficiency ratio is set forth below 
efficiency ratio gaap basis effect of excluding hann efficiency ratio excluding hann net interest income taxable equivalent basis our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which increased in  to million  as compared to the million attained in net interest income as a percentage of net interest income plus other income was for the twelve months ended december   for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  the increase in our net interest income in  as compared to  was primarily the result of the net contribution from interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities acquired from patriot 
in addition  since we are an asset sensitive institution  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  we experienced modest improvements in our net interest margin in the third and fourth quarters of  due to increases in interest rates 
these improvements  however  were not enough to significantly offset the decline experienced in the first half of  and consequently  our net interest margin for decreased five basis points  to  from for provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses was million for and million in this million decrease in the provision was the result of the continuing strength of our asset quality as evidenced by the decrease in total non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases plus other real estate owned  from at december   to at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was of period end loans and leases  or million  compared with or million at december  interest income received on impaired commercial loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these impaired loans 

table of contents at december   non performing assets totaled million and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  and included million in other real estate acquired through foreclosure and a million restructured loan 
at december   we had a restructured loan totaling million with a long time borrower 
however  in accordance with fas no  information about a restructured loan involving a modification of terms need not be included in disclosures in years after the restructuring if the restructuring agreement has market terms  including a market rate of interest  and the restructured loan is current and is expected to perform in accordance with the modified terms 
the removal of this restructured loan from nonperforming assets in january  contributed to the ratio changes noted above 
loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest were million at december   an increase from the million at december  potential problem loans consisted of loans that were performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
such loans totaled million at december   and million at december  we did not consider this increase to be indicative of any particular trends  as changes to risk ratings occur in the normal course of business 
noninterest income noninterest income  as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income  was  and for   and  respectively 
noninterest income increased million  or  in  over this net increase was composed primarily of the following increased service charges on deposit accounts of million  increased asset management fees of million  increased commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales of million  increased income from bank owned life insurance of million  increased net gains on sales of securities of million  net gains on the sales of branch deposits of million included in other  and decreased vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees of million 
service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was directly related to the acquisition of patriot and to the increase in demand deposits  from million at december   to million at december  asset management fees and commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales 
as part of our strategy to increase other fee based income  we continued to focus on enhancing the wealth management aspect of our business 
as a result  asset management fees increased  as assets under management at vfam increased  to billion at december   from billion at december  the patriot acquisition contributed million to the increase in assets under management 
commissions on brokerage  life insurance  and annuity sales increased  to million for  from million for income from bank owned life insurance 
the increase in income from bank owned life insurance for was be attributed to the purchase of million of life insurance in the third quarter of  million in the first quarter of  and million in the third quarter of in addition  we acquired million of bank owned life insurance through the patriot acquisition 

table of contents net gains on sales of securities 
in july and august of  as part of a restructuring of our investment portfolio in response to the patriot acquisition and eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we sold approximately million in securities and realized a net  pre tax gain of approximately million 
net gains on the sales of branch deposits 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we sold four branch locations of several banking subsidiaries 
we realized an aggregate net pre tax gain of million on the sale of their deposits  totaling million  to other financial institutions 
these sales were part of our effort to enhance the efficiency of our branch network through our previously announced plans to consolidate and or sell several locations 
vehicle origination  securitization  and servicing fees 
the decrease in vehicle origination  servicing  and securitization fees was primarily due to a reduction in securitization fees as a result of the roll off of earlier securitizations and lower lease origination volumes 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased million  or  in  over salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  increased million  or  from to the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily the result of the patriot acquisition  normal annual salary increases  new revenue producing positions  and higher benefit costs 
charges for occupancy increased million  or  in  from the increase was attributed to the patriot acquisition and general increases in the costs of doing business  predominantly in the categories of rent expense and real estate taxes 
vehicle delivery and preparation expense for increased million over the prior year s expense due to an increase in the number of vehicles that were turned in at the end of the lease and needed to be prepared for sale  as opposed to being purchased by the lessee 
we believed that the increase in the number of vehicles that were turned in at the end of the lease was caused by new car manufacturers continuing to offer attractive financing incentives 
all other expenses increased million  net 
the inclusion of patriot operations since june   contributed to a general increase in all expense categories 
in addition  we incurred expenses relating to our branding initiative of million and expenses relating to our bank realignment project of million 
income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the reduction in the effective tax rate for was primarily related to increased tax advantaged income as a result of the patriot acquisition and additional purchases of bank owned life insurance 
financial condition summary total assets at december  were billion  an increase of  as compared to total assets of billion at december  loans and leases increased to billion at december   from billion at december   while deposits increased to billion  from billion during the same time period 
equity capital was million at december   or per share  compared to million  or per share  at december

securities identified as available for sale were reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost was recorded in the equity section  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income 
as a result  our total equity was negatively impacted by million as the unrealized losses  net of taxes  on available for sale securities increased slightly  from a loss of million at december   to a loss of million at december  this increased loss was due to the interest rate environment 
investment securities available for sale increased million from december   to december  as part of the patriot acquisition  we acquired million in available for sale securities  however  in july and august of  as part of a restructuring of our investment portfolio in anticipation of the ramifications of eitf  we sold approximately million of these securities 
at december   we held no securities of one issuer  other than u

government obligations  where the aggregate book value exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity 
furthermore  there were no investment securities whose ratings were less than investment grade at december  and loans and leases loans and leases increased million  from december   to december  of this increase  patriot accounted for million  resulting in internal core growth of million 
in general  we believed that the internal growth that occurred in our loan portfolio in was accomplished through our sales and marketing efforts 
in general  the composition of our loan portfolio  by percentage of total loans  remained relatively unchanged from december   to december  the greatest percentage changes were between real estate construction loans  which increased by of total loans and leases  and consumer loans  which decreased by of total loans and leases 

table of contents our bank subsidiaries have historically reported a significant amount of loans secured by real estate 
many of these loans have real estate collateral taken as additional security not related to the acquisition of the real estate pledged 
open end home equity loans totaled million at december   and an additional million was lent against junior liens on residential properties at december  senior liens on family residential properties totaled million at december   and much of the billion in loans secured by non farm  non residential properties represented collateralization of operating lines  or term loans that finance equipment  inventory  or receivables

also  in the third and fourth quarters of  as part of our realignment project  we sold branch deposits totaling approximately million 
the net result of these transactions was an increase in total deposits of million 
of this net increase  million was in brokered certificates of deposit  which were utilized as an alternative funding source to support the increase in our loan portfolio 
we believed that the remainder of the net increase was a direct result of the continuing success of our bank subsidiaries in carrying out our retail and corporate sales initiatives 
short term borrowings short term borrowings  which included securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and treasury tax and loan notes  increased by million  or  from december  to december  the greatest increase within this category occurred in federal funds purchased  which increased from million at december   to million at december  federal home loan bank borrowings and long term debt federal home loan bank borrowings increased million and long term debt increased million from december   to december  of the increase in fhlb borrowings  the fair value of debt assumed through the patriot acquisition accounted for million  resulting in a net decrease of million
