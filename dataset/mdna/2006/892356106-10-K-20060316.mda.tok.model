the company has experienced considerable growth over the last five years  with an annual compounded unit growth rate of approximately 
this growth has expanded the company s market presence into states 
the company plans to continue this growth strategy with an annual projected increase in its unit count of approximately 
the company believes the projected unit count increase  along with strategic relocations of stores into areas of greater retail opportunity  will contribute substantially to the company s future growth 
the acquisition of del s enabled the company to establish an initial presence in the pacific northwest  primarily in washington  with one store in british columbia  canada 
the company operated retail farm and ranch stores as of december  and has plans to open approximately to stores in fiscal  and approximately store relocations 
the company has developed a proven method for selecting store sites and has identified over potential additional markets for new stores in the united states 
in addition  the company continues to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores 
the company plans to relocate additional stores over the next several years 
store relocations are typically undertaken to move small  older stores to full size formats in improved retail areas 
the company has relocated stores since the company has placed significant emphasis on its merchandising programs  evaluating the sales and profitability of its products through detailed line reviews  review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings 
these efforts  coupled with a strong marketing program and in depth product knowledge training of store employees  have enhanced sales and financial performance 
seasonality and weather the company s business is highly seasonal 
historically  the company s sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products 
the company typically operates at approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year 
unseasonable weather  excessive rain  drought  and early or late frosts may also affect the company s sales 
the company believes  however  that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores 
the company experiences its highest inventory and accounts payable levels during its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during its third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on its operations  it believes its sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation 
the company is subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services  which include  among other items  steel  grain  petroleum  corn  soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services 
moreover  in the last few years  energy prices have risen dramatically  which has resulted in increased fuel costs for the company s business and utility costs for the company s stores 
the company has been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation  principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in reducing or mitigating the effect of inflation on the company in the future

depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities

this increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates in the current year partially offset by a reduction in average long term borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in the prior year  resulting primarily from a higher effective state income tax rate due to the mix of business by state 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the prior year

depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores  remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities

exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in in the company s method of accounting for consideration received from vendors  net income for fiscal was million or per diluted share

change in accounting principle emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold 
prior to adopting this pronouncement  the company classified all vendor provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the effect of applying eitf on prior period financial statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income  thus the company has reported the adoption of eitf as a cumulative effect adjustment 
accordingly  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million million net of income taxes for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to normal operating expenses  the company s primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion  remodeling and relocation programs  including inventory purchases and capital expenditures 
the company s primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations  commitments available under its revolving credit agreement  capital and operating leases and normal trade credit 
the company s inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons  respectively

the increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from additional inventory for new stores including preparation of stores to open in the subsequent year and an increase in average inventory per store due to an expected increase in sales 
trade credit arises from the company s vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases 
payment terms vary from days to days depending on the product and vendor 
the increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and accrued expenses was generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation and resulting increases in sales  growth in operations  and timing of payments 
borrowings and credit facilities in august  the company entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na  as agent for a lender group the credit agreement  whereby the company is permitted to borrow up to million

in addition  the company must comply with certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling four quarters basis regarding net worth  leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage  current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  sources and uses of cash the company s primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt  respectively

these increases were primarily due to the growth in the company s business during fiscal and the timing of payments 
investing activities investing activities used million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of this cash requirement relates to the company s capital expenditures and in fiscal  to the acquisition of the assets of del s farm supply in the company s significant store expansion  coupled with required investment in infrastructure  required the following capital expenditures  including capital leases in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened    existing stores    distribution center capacity and improvements    information technology    corporate and other  the company s long term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets 
this growth will also require continuing investment in information technology and people 
the costs reflected are typically building improvements as the company leases the majority of its facilities 
the company currently estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal  as follows in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened  existing store improvements  distribution center capacity and improvements  information technology  corporate and other  financing activities financing activities used million  provided million  and used million in fiscal  and  respectively  largely as a result of borrowing requirements created by operations  partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  borrowings available under the credit agreement  and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and its capital expenditure needs  including store openings  relocations and renovations  over the next several years

letters of credit allow the company to purchase inventory in a timely manner 
known trends  events  demands  commitments and uncertainties litigation the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
after consultation with legal counsel  management expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings 
as previously disclosed  in the company s annual report on form k for fiscal filed on march  which annual report was amended by the filing of amendment no 
to the company s annual report on form k a on april   in july  a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the chancery court for davidson county  tennessee by the hawaii laborers pension plan against each of the company s directors  certain of its officers and one former director 
the company was named as a nominal defendant

sales tax compliance a portion of the company s sales are with tax exempt customers 
the company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction 
many of the states in which the company conducts business will audit the company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws 
the business activities of the company s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the company create a challenging and complex environment of compliance 
these circumstances also create some risk that the company could be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance 
while the company believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations  there can be no assurance that the company  upon final completion of such audits  would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions 
management believes it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and expected settlements 
recent accounting pronouncements stock options in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
the company has adopted sfas r in fiscal  as required 
sfas r permits the use of either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permit the restatement of prior period financial statements based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use a modified black scholes model for option valuation 
sfas r includes several modifications to the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in the company s effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
furthermore  it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
the income tax impact is uncertain and cannot be estimated  because it will depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions  as shown in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  were million  million  and million  respectively  for   and the company will utilize the modified prospective method 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas r on january  will reduce fiscal net earnings by approximately million million after tax 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s stock based compensation plans 
inventory costs in november of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
the purpose of this statement is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and waste material 
arb no 
stated that under some circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be treated as current period costs 
sfas requires that these costs be treated as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of so abnormal 
the provisions of sfas shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas on january  did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
exchange of nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning with the third quarter of  with earlier application permitted 
adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company complies with sfas nos 
  and collectively sfas pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas impacted the accounting for the company s interest rate swap agreement  which was designated as a cash flow hedge 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at either the bank s base rate and december  and december   respectively or libor and at december  and december   respectively plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum  adjusted quarterly  based on company performance at both december  and december  
the company is also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from to based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately  of additional annual interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long term debt
