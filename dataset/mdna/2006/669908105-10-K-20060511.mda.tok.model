active components distributed by the company include semiconductor products such as memory chips  microprocessors  digital and linear circuits  microwave rf and fiberoptic components  transistors and diodes 
passive components distributed by nic  nia and nie  principally to oems and other distributors nationally  consist of a high technology line of chip and leaded components including capacitors  resistors and related networks 
commencing in the second half of calendar  the electronics manufacturing and the electronics distribution industries in which the company operates began to experience double digit sequential and year over year increases in sales dollar volume 
additionally  there have been recent consolidations in the electronics distribution industry  resulting in greater market share for certain of the remaining companies 
management believes that  although the marketplace continues to afford poor near term visibility  the sales dollar volume improvement in the components market worldwide should continue through fiscal  although at a single digit rate 
the increase in sales volume has been accompanied by continued downward margin pressures  primarily due to the industry shift to production in asia 
prior to the industry sales volume increases  the company adopted a strategy of maintaining its infrastructure and investing in personnel 
recognizing the industry shift to overseas production  the company significantly increased its asian operations 
the company also took advantage of the recent industry consolidation by hiring a significant number of additional sales and engineering personnel and adding to its line card 
this strategy has yielded positive results to date 
sales in asia increased for the fiscal year over  while sales in the us increased by 
nevertheless  the company s book to bill ratio  company wide  remains positive 
year over year and quarter over quarter compared to the prior periods the company has increased market share with all of its major suppliers for both the semiconductor and passive component businesses 
for the year ended february   net sales increased to million from million for the prior year with net income of  or

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth below in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  also see the discussions in forward looking statements  risk factors and notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues at time of shipment of its products and sales are recorded net of discounts and returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
our estimate of the allowances needed is based on our past history of collections of accounts receivable from our customers 
this history has shown that we have always provided sufficient allowances in prior periods 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required thereby reducing our operating income 
for example  at fiscal year end  each additional accounts receivable allowance would reduce operating income by approximately  for the year ended february  inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon product franchise agreements governing price protection  stock rotation and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the ability to return inventory pursuant to our distributor franchise agreements 
in prior periods  reserves required for obsolescence were not material to our financial statements 
if assumptions about future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories could be required 
for example  at fiscal year end  each additional of obsolete inventory or if the company was unable to return inventory pursuant to its distributor agreements and could not be returned under our many distributor franchise agreements  would reduce operating income by approximately  for the year ended february  fiscal year versus results of operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of  or 
management believes that this sales increase is primarily due to increased market share resulting from the industry consolidation  its increased sales personnel and the expansion of its line card and customer base  both domestically and in asia 
the unknown near term visibility in the electronics manufacturing and the electronics distribution industries makes it difficult for management to estimate the company s overall sales volume and earnings for the company s next fiscal year 
management believes  however  that the industry growth rate in the near term will be in the single digits

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year versus continued results of operations continued gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management believes that this continuing gross margin pressure results from a change in the company s product mix and increased order size coupled with increased sales in the asian market  which requires lower selling prices due to volume demand from large asian contract manufacturers 
management believes that margin pressures may continue during the first half of fiscal and possibly stabilize in the second half of the year  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
operating expenses increased to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   an increase of  or 
the dollar increase in operating expenses was due to increases in the following expense categories approximately  or of the increase was for personnel related costs resulting from increased staffing levels in connection with the expansion of the company s asian and us operational capability during the current fiscal year 
management made a strategic decision to invest in expanding the company s personnel during the recent phase of market consolidation  which resulted in increased personnel related operating expenses 
management believes that this investment will enable the company to continue to achieve sales growth in excess of that currently experienced by the industry  although no assurances can be given in this regard 
approximately  or of the increase was a result of net increases in various other expenses and fees such as rent  utilities  telephone  insurance  and computer expenses  among others  which represent of the company s total overhead interest expense increased to  for the year ended february  as compared to  for the year ended february  this increase in interest expense resulted from greater bank borrowings incurred to support the increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels  as well as the effect of increased interest rates on those borrowings during the fiscal year 
net income from for the year ended february  was  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share as compared to  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share for the year ended february  management attributes the increase in earnings in fiscal to the increase in sales providing increased gross margin dollars exceeding the increase in operating and interest expense 
fiscal year versus results of operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of  or 
given the historically cyclical nature of the company s industry  management attributed this increase in sales performance in the latter part of fiscal calendar as the break out period the electronic components industry had long been expecting 
the substantial year over year sales gains can be attributed to the recovery experienced by the semiconductor industry in general over the last twelve months as well as a significant increase in our asian sales  which experienced an increase of approximately in fiscal compared to the prior year 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  management believes that this continuing gross margin pressure resulted from a change in the company s product mix and increased order size coupled with increased sales in the asian market  which requires lower selling prices due to volume demand from large asian contract manufacturers page

the dollar increase in operating expenses was due to increases in the following expense categories approximately  or of the increase was for personnel related costs resulting from increased staffing levels in connection with the expansion of the company s asian and us operational capability during the current fiscal year 
the remaining increases were a result of net increases in bank fees and charges  or  insurances and professional fees  or  sarbanes oxley compliance  or  rent  or  bad debt reserves  or  freight  or and miscellaneous other expenses  or 
management made a strategic decision to invest in expanding the company s personnel during the recent market downturn  which resulted in increased operating expenses 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended february  as compared to  for the year ended february  this increase was primarily due to a return to bank borrowings beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the increase in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels which were needed to support increased sales activity in the latter half of the fiscal period and a sales increase for fiscal net income for the year ended february  was  or

liquidity and capital resources fiscal year versus the company ended its fiscal year with working capital and cash aggregating approximately  and  respectively  as compared to approximately  and  respectively  at february  the company s current ratio at february   was as compared to at february  on september   the company entered into a secured revolving line of credit agreement  as amended  with eight banks  which currently provides for maximum borrowings of  on november   the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to provide for borrowings utilizing an asset based formula predicated on a certain percentage of outstanding domestic accounts receivable and inventory levels at any given month end 
based on the asset based formula  the company may not be able to borrow the maximum amount available under its credit line at all times 
borrowings under the credit line bear interest at either i the lead bank s prime rate or ii libor plus basis points  at the option of the company  through september   the due date of the loan 
direct borrowings under the line of credit were  at february  and  at february  as of the end of each of the fiscal periods  the company had met all of the required bank covenants 
the company has reached a preliminary agreement with a singapore bank to provide a million secured line of credit to the company s asian subsidiaries and thereby finance the company s asian operations 
the company expects to enter into a definitive loan agreement with respect to this facility early in its second fiscal quarter 
the company anticipates that its resources provided by its cash flow from operations and its current borrowing agreement  will be sufficient to meet its financing requirements for the next twelve month period 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements

however  inflation and changing interest rates have had a significant effect on the economy in general and therefore could affect the operating results of the company in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk all of the company s bank debt and the associated interest expense are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  for the year ended february  and  for the year ended february  as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company is in a borrowing mode 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has several foreign subsidiaries in asia  the united kingdom and canada 
the company does business in more than one dozen countries and currently generates approximately of its revenues from outside north america 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which the company does business 
the company s total assets in its foreign subsidiaries was million and million at february  and respectively  translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the company also acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and  as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s results in future periods 
the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material in the quarter or year ended february  the company does not currently employ any currency derivative instruments  futures contracts or other currency hedging techniques to mitigate its risks in this regard 
industry risk the electronic component industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross profit margins and profits  from year to year 
for example  during calendar  the industry experienced a severe decline in the demand for electronic components  which caused sales to decrease by 
the prior year reflected a increase in net sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic component industry
