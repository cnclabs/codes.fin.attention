executive summary we are a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment focused on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our rental tools segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our well intervention  rental tools  marine and other oilfield services segments 
in recent years  we have expanded geographically so that we now have a growing presence in select domestic land and international markets 
we also own and operate  through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  mature oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels in our service and rental tools segments are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected future commodity prices  drilling rig count  oil and gas production levels  and customers capital spending allocated for drilling and production 
the primary factors driving our performance in were increased customer spending levels on finding and replacing oil and gas reserves due to high commodity prices  increased customer focus on replacing reserves through production enhancement projects in existing wells  and the active hurricane season  which disrupted a strong gulf of mexico market  but created incremental long term demand for our products and services 
in  activity across all segments increased throughout the year  particularly in the gulf of mexico 
however  the extraordinarily active hurricane season highlighted by damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita disrupted most gulf of mexico based well intervention service and rental tool activity for almost three months following the storms 
by mid november  pre storm gulf activity levels resumed for well intervention services and rental tools and by year end demand for most services and tools were exceeding those levels 
the marine segment participated in post storm damage assessment and construction support projects throughout the fourth quarter 
by the end of the year  liftboat demand continued to grow due to the post hurricane construction and repair work  coupled with well intervention work that was deferred prior to the storms 
this led to unprecedented dayrates for liftboats as year end dayrates were higher than rates in august  and higher than dayrates we were generating during the second and third quarters of when prior peak dayrates were established 
also  for the first time in several years  we were able to achieve meaningful price increases for some of our well intervention services 
financial performance for services has traditionally been driven by volume  or utilization  while pricing improvement has been difficult to achieve 
however  pent up demand and incremental work created by hurricane damage have allowed us to raise prices on some services by as much as 
the active hurricane season also caused significant damage to the industry s gulf of mexico infrastructure 
our participation in the gulf of mexico repair efforts include project management  marine and well control engineering  relief well planning  supervision and execution  well intervention planning  offshore supervision and offshore site and activity management  well abandonment  and specialty equipment and tools 
in addition  we will provide our liftboats  well intervention services and rental tools to many more projects that we are not managing 
our oil and gas production remained largely shut in following the hurricanes due to hurricane damage 
during the fourth quarter  we were repairing our properties and awaiting repairs to pipelines owned by third parties 
average production during the second quarter of  prior to the active hurricane season  was approximately  barrels of oil equivalent boe per day 
however  in the third and fourth quarters  production averaged approximately  boe per day and  boe per day  respectively 
all of our production is expected to be restored by the end of the first quarter of 
table of contents in our other geographic market areas  we benefited from increased levels of customer spending driven by high commodity prices 
international revenue was a record million  primarily due to continued expansion of our rental tools business in markets such as the north sea  venezuela  the middle east and west africa and well intervention activity in australia  egypt and venezuela 
approximately of our international revenue is derived from the rental tools segment 
the remainder is derived from well intervention services such as hydraulic workover  sidetrack drilling and well control services 
domestically  we aggressively expanded our rentals of drill pipe  ancillary tubulars  handling tools  stabilizers  and drill collars to market areas in arkansas  louisiana  texas  oklahoma and wyoming 
toward the end of the year we expanded our well intervention services in these market areas 
drilling rig counts and production related spending are expected to grow domestically on land  and we believe we can successfully expand our presence in these market areas 
as a result  demand should continue at high levels in the markets in which we compete due to the current high level of commodity prices and our customers focus on rapidly replacing oil and gas reserves from reservoirs that deliver the highest returns for the least amount of risk 
in the gulf of mexico  activity is expected to remain robust 
in the deepwater gulf  large energy producers continue to fund exploration and drilling programs in an effort to locate and produce large reservoirs of oil and gas 
the shallow water gulf is more mature  providing production enhancement opportunities for smaller operators 
the mature nature of the shallow water gulf market should benefit our newly constructed derrick barge which is expected to be available during the third quarter of and increase our ability to acquire additional mature properties 
we expect decommissioning activity to accelerate as shallow water wells become uneconomical and platforms must be removed 
mature wells often require significant intervention to enhance  extend and maintain production 
the costs of this intervention  coupled with the additional risks associated with hurricanes  may lead many energy producers to re assess the costs and benefits of owning these mature properties 
well intervention segment the well intervention segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
while our gross margin percentage tends to be fairly consistent  special projects such as well control can directly increase the gross margin percentage 
revenue and operating income were and higher  respectively  as compared to despite significant hurricane related downtime in the gulf of mexico 
this downtime was more than offset by strong gulf of mexico activity levels during the first half of the year  especially for services such as coiled tubing  mechanical wireline and electric line services  and improved pricing for many services toward the end of the year 
in addition  year over year performance improved significantly for well control and hydraulic workover services in non gulf of mexico markets 
rental tools segment the rental tools segment is capital intensive with high operating margins as a result of relatively low operating costs 
the largest fixed cost is typically depreciation as there is little labor associated with our rental tools business 
pricing generally does not fluctuate and financial performance is a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
revenue increased and operating income increased over the biggest increases in revenue and operating income were from the rentals of drill pipe  particularly rentals in international markets  as well as rentals of on site accommodations and handling tools 
rentals outside the gulf of mexico represented more than of this segment s total revenue in marine segment the operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed and  therefore  gross margin percentages vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
as an indication of this 
table of contents segment s performance  our gross margin percentages were in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
revenue increased and operating income increased more than over liftboat dayrates and utilization steadily increased during the first and second quarters of the year 
activity levels were improving in august prior to hurricanes katrina and rita 
following the storms  dayrates increased to record levels and liftboat utilization averaged approximately during the fourth quarter as our liftboats were used to support our customers damage assessment and construction projects 
we sold of our smaller liftboats during the second quarter 
these liftboats had lower gross profit percentages than our fleet of larger liftboats 
other oilfield services more than half of this segment s revenues are derived from our offshore platform and property management business  a labor intensive business with low margins 
environmental services  such as dockside vessel and tank cleaning and non hazardous oilfield waste treatment  comprise most of the other revenue in this segment 
revenues increased over  but our operating loss increased to million from million in this segment s operating loss would have decreased by approximately million if we did not incur non recurring  non cash charges related to the sale of our oil spill response assets and the reduction in value of our non hazardous oilfield waste treatment business as a result of our intent to sell the business 
the segment s customer base operates in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
the hurricane season disrupted drilling activity during the last half of the year  adversely impacting production and drilling activity  the primary drivers for our offshore platform and property management business and our environmental businesses  respectively 
also  several of our gulf coast facilities suffered hurricane related damage  limiting our environmental service capabilities during the third and fourth quarters 
oil and gas segment through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  we acquire  manage and decommission mature properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
as of december   we had interests in offshore blocks containing structures and approximately producing wells 
the main objective of this business segment is to provide additional opportunities for our products and services  especially during cyclical and seasonal slower periods 
because of the fixed cost nature of our well intervention services  the incremental cost to work on mature properties is far less than it would be for traditional energy producers 
this segment provides work for our services  thereby increasing utilization of our own assets by deploying services on our own properties during periods of downtime 
the lease operating expenses for these types of properties are typically relatively high because of the amount of well intervention service work required to enhance  maintain and extend production for mature properties 
the gross operating margin is also a function of oil and gas prices 
revenues were higher and operating income was higher than although we benefited from higher commodity prices and more production as a result of properties we acquired in  approximately  boe of production was deferred as a result of extensive damage caused by the active hurricane season 
we did not suffer any permanent damage to wells  and we expect our production to be fully restored by the end of the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including oil and gas properties  used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance  and with respect to our oil and gas properties  future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on our fair value and carrying value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments using various cash flow and earnings projections 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
services and rentals are generally provided based on fixed or determinable priced purchase orders or contracts with customers 
we contract for marine  well intervention and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
our rental tools are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
we recognize oil and gas revenue from our interests in producing wells as the commodities are delivered  and the revenue is recorded net of royalties and hedge payments due or inclusive of hedge payments receivable 
self insurance 
we self insure up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  protection and indemnity  general liability  property damage  and group medical 
with the recent tightening in the insurance markets  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have an actuary review our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns  health care costs and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate reinsurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  acquires mature oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
spn resources property purchases are recorded at the value exchanged at closing  combined with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of each field 
we estimate the third party market value including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our out of pocket costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 

table of contents oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission and generally accepted accounting principles 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the actual estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we enter into hedging transactions for our oil production to reduce exposure to the fluctuations in oil prices 
our hedging transactions to date have consisted of financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars with a major financial institution 
we may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil and natural gas 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we are required to record our derivative instruments at fair market value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair market value is an estimate based on future commodity prices available at the time of the calculation 
the fair market value could differ from actual settlements if the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   revenues were million and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
we experienced higher revenue and gross margin in all our segments  especially our rental tools  oil and gas and well intervention segments as activity levels increased 
however  the extraordinarily active hurricane season disrupted most of our activity for several months following hurricanes katrina and rita 
the following table compares our operating results for the years ended december  and gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of services from revenue for each of our five business segments 
oil and gas eliminations represent products and services provided to the oil and gas segment by the company s four other segments 
revenue gross margin change change well intervention rental tools marine other oilfield services oil and gas less oil and gas elim total the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 

table of contents well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased slightly to in from in we experienced higher revenue for almost all of our services as production related activity improved in the gulf of mexico  particularly for the well control  hydraulic workover  coiled tubing and wireline services 
activity levels declined in the months following hurricanes katrina and rita  but pre storm demand levels returned near the end of the year 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and we experienced significant increases in revenue from our on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories and stabilizers 
the increases are primarily the result of significant increases in activity in the gulf of mexico  as well as our international and domestic expansion efforts 
although our rental tools segment was negatively impacted from hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of  activity levels surpassed pre storm levels for most of our rental tools by the end of the year 
our international revenue for the rental tools segment has increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from our biggest improvements were in the north sea  trinidad  venezuela and mexico 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  includes only five months of rental activity from the foot and the to foot class liftboats 
these rental liftboats were sold effective june  the increase in revenue is caused by increased utilization of our fleet s remaining larger liftboats at higher dayrates partially offset by fewer liftboats generating revenue for seven months of the increase in the gross margin percentage is also caused by increased demand and the sale of our lower margin rental liftboats 
the fleet s average dayrate increased to approximately  in the year ended december  from  in increased demand as well as the sale of the smaller liftboats also contributed to the increase in average dayrates 
the fleet s average utilization increased to approximately for the year ended december  from in our liftboat fleet experienced strong increases in demand and pricing in the fourth quarter as liftboats were needed for the large amount of construction and repair work in the gulf of mexico as a result of hurricane damage 
other oilfield services segment revenue from our other oilfield services segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the million in revenue for the gross margin percentage increased to in the year ended december  from in the revenue increase is primarily due to increased demand for our field management and waste disposal services 
the increase in the segment s gross margin percentage is due to the increased demand as well as cost saving efforts in our waste disposal services 
this segment incurred an operating loss of approximately million  which includes approximately million of storm related general and administrative expenses primarily due to damage to its equipment and facilities from hurricanes katrina and rita and million of losses as the result of our decision to sell off our oil spill response inventory and equipment and our non hazardous waste disposal service business 
oil and gas segment oil and gas revenues were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in revenue is primarily the result of production from south pass  which was acquired in july  and production from west delta  which was 
table of contents acquired in december we also acquired galveston and high island a in late july in the year ended december   production was approximately  boe as compared to approximately  boe in the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and the oil and gas segment was affected by significant amounts of curtailed production resulting from the active hurricane seasons the past two years resulting in deferred production as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in of approximately  boe and as a result of hurricane ivan in of approximately  boe 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily a result of depletion and accretion related to our oil and gas properties from both increased production and acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the increase also results from the depreciation associated with our and capital expenditures primarily in the rental tools segment 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in of this increase  million is the result of storm related costs from hurricanes katrina and rita in the third and fourth quarters of including million in equipment and facility losses and repairs  million in relief aid to more than employees affected by the hurricanes and million in storm related payroll expenses  temporary lodging and miscellaneous expenses 
the remaining increase was primarily related to increased payroll and bonus expenses  increased insurance costs and expenses as a result of our growth  oil and gas acquisitions and geographic expansion 
reduction in value of assets during the year ended december   we reduced the value of two of our mature oil and gas properties by approximately million  thereby removing the reserve balance associated with these wells 
the wells were deemed to be uneconomical to further produce as a result of the estimated costs associated with maintaining production 
our oil spill containment boom manufacturing facility suffered damage from hurricane katrina and experienced difficulty in resuming normal business operations 
as a result  we elected not to reopen this manufacturing facility and sell the remaining oil spill containment boom inventory 
we reduced the value of the assets of this business which consist primarily of inventory and property and equipment by approximately million to the estimated net realizable value 
in the first quarter of  we sold our non hazardous oilfield waste subsidiary  environmental treatment team  llc ett for approximately million in cash 
we reduced the net asset value of ett by million in to its approximate sales price 
gain on sale of liftboats effective june   we sold all of our rental liftboats with leg lengths from feet to feet for million in cash exclusive of costs to sell  which resulted in a gain of million 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   revenues were million and net income was million which includes million of pre tax other income due to the gain from insurance proceeds  diluted earnings per share was for the same period 
we experienced higher revenues from our rental tools and well intervention segments 
we also benefited from oil and gas production following our initial acquisition of properties in the gulf of mexico in december the following table compares our operating results for the years ended december  and gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of services from revenue for each of our five business segments

well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in this segment s gross margin percentage increased to in the year ended december  from in we experienced increased demand for almost all of our services  and we also benefited by completing various decommissioning projects on our oil and gas properties 
these increases in demand and decommissioning projects contributed to the improvement in the segment s gross margin percentage 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the increase in this segment s revenue was primarily due to an increased demand for our expanded inventory of downhole rental tool equipment and our continued international expansion  due primarily to the august acquisition of premier oilfield services 
in addition  we benefited from increased bolting  torque and on site machining work and increased rentals of stabilizers and housing units 
the gross margin percentage declined slightly to in the year ended december  from in of due primarily to a change in the mix of our rental revenue 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  slightly decreased from to million 
the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  remained unchanged at 
the fleet s average dayrate decreased slightly to  in the year ended december  from  in  but average utilization increased to for the year ended december  from in average fleet dayrates entering were significantly less than the same period a year ago due to lower demand for liftboats 
as liftboat utilization increased throughout the year  we began to experience higher rates  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease over the million in revenue for the lower revenue is primarily attributable to the sale of our construction and fabrication assets in august  which had revenue of approximately million in the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at in and the decrease in revenue resulted in a million operating loss for this segment in oil and gas segment oil and gas revenues were million and the gross margin percentage was for the year ended december   compared to revenues of million and gross margin percentage of for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is due to the fact that our oil and gas segment began in december

the increase is also the result of our acquisition of premier oilfield services in august and capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our acquisitions  internal growth and international expansion 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we made million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory 
we also made million of capital expenditures in our oil and gas segment and million of capital expenditures  inclusive of million in progress payments made on the crane as noted below and million for the purchase of a foot class liftboat which we were previously operating  to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention  marine and other oilfield services segments 
in addition  we made million of capital expenditures on construction and improvements to our facilities 
in march  we contracted to construct an ton derrick barge to support our decommissioning operations on the outer continental shelf 
the contracts are for the construction of a foot barge and crane for a price of approximately million 
this amount does not include any future change orders  barge outfitting or mobilization costs 
progress payments were made on the crane in accordance with the terms set forth in the contract 
letters of credit are due on the barge based on contract milestones 
the contract price for the barge will be payable upon its delivery and acceptance 
we expect the barge to be available in the gulf of mexico late in the third quarter of we intend to utilize it to remove platforms and structures owned by our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  and compete in the gulf of mexico construction market for both installation and removal projects 
at december   the total amount of progress payments made on the crane was approximately million 
we also placed a deposit of approximately million on an anchor handling tug for the barge 
the remaining balance of approximately million is expected to be paid in the first quarter of we also paid additional consideration for prior acquisitions of million in  all of which were capitalized and accrued during we have a bank credit facility consisting of a revolving credit facility of million  with an option to increase it to million 
any balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility is due on october  the credit facility bears interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on the company s leverage ratio 
as of february   there was no balance outstanding on this credit facility 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including the pledge of the stock of the company s principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that the company satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits the company s capital expenditures  its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to the company s capital structure  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or assume additional decommissioning liabilities which would require supplemental bonding

these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
we have identified capital expenditure projects that will require approximately million in  exclusive of any acquisitions for  among other things  geographic expansion  the construction of our derrick barge and anchor handling tug  the refurbishment of a foot class liftboat and reserve additions in our oil and gas segment 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may 
table of contents require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
hedging activities we enter into hedging transactions with major financial institutions to secure a commodity price for a portion of our future production and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for trading purposes 
crude oil hedges are settled based on the average of the reported settlement prices for west texas intermediate crude on the new york mercantile exchange nymex for each month 
we had no natural gas hedges as of december  and we use financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars that provide floor and ceiling prices with varying upside price participation 
our swaps and zero cost collars are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
with a financially settled swap  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the hedged price for the transaction  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the hedged price for the transaction 
with a zero cost collar  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price of the collar  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the cap price for the collar 
we recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in oil and gas revenues 
for the year ended december   hedging settlement payments reduced oil revenues by approximately million dollars and gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness were not material

table of contents is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we have not made use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
interest rates at december   none of our long term debt outstanding had variable interest rates  and we had no interest rate risks at that time 
commodity price risk our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth partially depends upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that can economically be produced 
we use derivative commodity instruments to manage commodity price risks associated with future oil and natural gas production 
as of december   we had the following contracts in place crude oil positions instrument strike volume bbls remaining contract term type price bbl daily total bbls swap    collar    our hedged volume as of december  was approximately of our estimated production from proved reserves for the balance of the terms of the contracts 
had these contracts been terminated at december   the estimated loss would have been million  net of taxes 
we used a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of crude oil would have on the fair value of its existing derivative instruments 
based on the derivative instruments outstanding at december   a increase in the underlying commodity price  increased the net estimated loss associated with the commodity derivative instrument by million
