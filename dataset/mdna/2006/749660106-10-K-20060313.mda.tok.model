item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
see also forward looking statements on page rpc  inc rpc provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration  production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the united states  including the gulf of mexico  mid continent  southwest and rocky mountain regions  and selected international locations 
the company s revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells 
our key business and financial strategies are to focus our management resources on and invest our capital in equipment and geographic markets that we believe will earn high returns on capital  and maintain an appropriate capital structure 
to maintain a flexible cost structure that can respond quickly to volatile industry conditions and business activity levels 
to deliver equipment and services to our customers safely 
to maximize shareholder return by optimizing the balance between cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of our common stock on the open market 
to align the interests of our management and shareholders 
in assessing the outcomes of these strategies and rpc s financial condition and operating performance  management generally reviews periodic forecast data  monthly actual results  and other similar information 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial data  including revenues  utilization of our equipment and personnel  pricing for our services and equipment  profit margins  selling  general and administrative expenses  cash flows and the return on our invested capital 
we continuously monitor factors that impact the level of current and expected customer activity levels  such as the price of oil and natural gas  changes in pricing for our services and equipment and utilization of our equipment and personnel 
our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum producing regions of the world  overall economic conditions and weather in the united states  the prices of oil and natural gas  and our customers drilling and production activities 
current industry conditions include historically high  volatile natural gas prices  historically high  rising oil prices  and a steadily increasing domestic rig count 
during  the price of natural gas increased dramatically at the end of the third quarter as a result of the severe hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which significantly disrupted us natural gas production 
the price of oil increased steadily during the year  due to increased worldwide demand and concerns about supply disruption in many of the world s oil producing regions 
the rig count increased as well  but current and future increases are constrained by the available supply of domestic drilling rigs 
these trends in resulted in increased utilization of our equipment and personnel followed by increased pricing for the company s services and equipment 
improved results have also allowed us to make higher capital expenditures  which has led to an increase in capacity for providing services to our customers 
the results of our strategies are reflected in our financial and operational performance 
we generated record revenues and profitability in because of better industry conditions  increased capacity  improved pricing and growth in the utilization of our personnel and equipment 
revenues in of million increased percent compared to the prior year 
the growth in revenues resulted primarily from increased capacity due to our expenditures for new equipment and maintenance on existing equipment  improved pricing for our equipment and services  and increased utilization consistent with higher customer activity levels 
the increase in prices is partially attributable to the issuance of new price books during the third quarter of international revenues declined by percent in compared to the prior year 
although international revenues increased in most of our locations due to our focus on developing international opportunities  these increases were offset by a large decline in revenues from our operation in kuwait 
this decline was due to the sporadic nature of our work in that country as well as other customer imposed delays 
we continue to focus on developing international growth opportunities  however  it is difficult to predict when contracts and projects will be initiated and their ultimate duration 
based on current industry conditions and trends during and our planned capital expenditures  we expect consolidated revenues for to increase compared to  although the volatility in our industry makes accurate near term forecasts unreliable 
in the third quarter we sold certain assets of the company s hammer  casing  laydown and casing torque turn service lines generating proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of approximately million 
this sale resulted in an after tax gain of approximately million or diluted earnings per share 
income before income taxes was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the effective tax rates reflect tax benefits of percent in related to income tax refunds and percent in primarily related to adjustments for foreign tax credit carryovers and liabilities 
diluted earnings per share increased to in compared to for the prior year 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in the prior year  and cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of million compared to december  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents occurred despite improved operating results and higher proceeds from the sale of assets  primarily due to increased capital expenditures and increased share repurchases 
as of december   we had no long term debt 
cost of services rendered and goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately percentage points in compared to this improvement was due to higher equipment and personnel utilization  improved pricing and the leverage of our fixed costs over higher revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points to percent  which was due primarily to the leverage of these costs over higher revenues 
the costs increased due to additions to field administrative personnel consistent with higher activity levels  and costs to implement additional information technology to support operational efficiencies at higher activity levels 
consistent with our strategy to selectively grow our capacity and maintain our existing fleet of high demand equipment  capital expenditures were million in although we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million during  the total amount of expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements  expansion opportunities and the ultimate delivery dates for equipment on order 
we expect these expenditures to be primarily directed toward our larger  core service lines including pressure pumping  snubbing  nitrogen  and rental tools 
on october   rpc s board of directors declared a three for two stock split of the company s common shares 
the additional shares were distributed on december   to shareholders of record on november  all share  earnings per share  and dividends per share data presented throughout this document including the accompanying financial statements and management s discussion and analysis have been adjusted to reflect this stock split 
outlook drilling activity in the us domestic oilfields  as measured by the rotary drilling rig count  has been stable or gradually increasing since the second quarter of  and the overall domestic rig count during the first two months of is approximately percent higher than in the comparable period in the price of oil has risen by approximately percent and the price of natural gas has risen by approximately percent during the first two months of as well 
while the overall drilling rig count has increased  drilling activity in the gulf of mexico has steadily declined since the third quarter of  which is unfavorable because of the company s historical presence in this geographic market 
at the beginning of march  the gulf of mexico rig count was approximately percent lower than in the comparable period in  and much of this decline is attributable to the damage caused by the hurricanes in the third quarter of the company has responded to the sustained increase in overall industry activity by making investments in our geographic market areas where we currently operate  but we have emphasized the more robust domestic markets and have made only selective investments in the gulf of mexico market 
in spite of the current robust industry conditions  the company understands that factors influencing the industry are unpredictable 
our response to the industry s potential uncertainty is to maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand periodic industry downturns  and a balanced capital structure that allows us to expand during periods of industry expansion 
results of operations years ended december  consolidated revenues revenues by business segment technical support other consolidated operating profit operating profit by business segment technical support other corporate expenses gain on disposition of assets  net net income earnings per share diluted percentage of cost of services rendered and goods sold to revenues percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to revenues percentage of depreciation and amortization expense to revenues effective income tax rate average us domestic rig count average natural gas price per thousand cubic feet mcf average oil price per barrel year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased million or percent compared to the technical services segment revenues for increased percent from the prior year due primarily to increases in capacity driven by higher capital expenditures  improved utilization  and increased pricing driven by higher customer demand for our services 
this increase was partially offset by the disposal of our casing installation services in the third quarter of the support services segment revenues for increased percent from the prior year as a result of higher capacity  equipment utilization and increased pricing in rental tools  which is the largest service line within this segment 
the growth in this segment was lower than the change in the domestic rig count and in technical services due to this segment s exposure to the gulf of mexico  a region in which activity has been very weak since the hurricanes in the third quarter of in addition  these increases were also offset by the lack of revenues for from our marine liftboat division  which was sold in the fourth quarter of the marine liftboat division generated revenues of million in domestic revenues increased during due to increased customer demand for our services  which we were able to meet with increases in capacity  utilization and improved pricing as a result of new price books issued during the third quarter of the average domestic rig count during was percent higher than the same period in in addition  the average price of natural gas increased by approximately percent and the average price of oil increased by approximately percent during compared to the prior year 
this increase in oil and gas prices and the resulting increase in drilling activity had a positive impact on our financial results 
these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the gulf of mexico market  which was especially weak in the third and fourth quarters as a result of the hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter 
foreign revenues decreased from million in to million in due to a large decline in our kuwait operation 
this decline was due to the sporadic nature of the contract as well as customer imposed delays 
this decline was offset by increases in almost all of our other international locations as well as the inception of a new contract in turkmenistan 
these increases were due to our increased focus on international business and our business development efforts 
cost of services rendered and goods sold 
costs of services rendered and goods sold in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
the increase in these costs was due to the variable nature of many of these expenses  including compensation  materials and supplies  maintenance and repair  and fuel costs and the increase in the price of fuel 
cost of services rendered and goods sold  as a percent of revenues  decreased to percent in from percent in as a result of higher utilization of personnel and operating equipment  improved pricing  and the leveraging of fixed costs over higher revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in compared to million in  however as a percentage of revenues  decreased percentage points to percent 
the increase was primarily due to higher employment costs associated with additions to field administrative personnel to handle higher business activity levels and costs to implement additional information technology to support operational efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were million in  an increase of million or percent compared to million in this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from various capital expenditures made during recent quarters within support services and technical services 
a larger percentage of the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to capital expenditures made in the support service segment than the technical service segment  despite its smaller relative revenues and total assets  because of investments made in the rental tools service line  the largest service line within support services  and a new support services operational facility that was constructed in gain on disposition of assets  net 
gain on the disposition of assets  net increased primarily due to the sale of certain assets of the hammer  casing  laydown and casing torque turn service lines for net proceeds of million which generated a pre tax gain of million  or after tax gain per diluted share 
the gain on disposition of assets in was due primarily to the pre tax gain of million on the sale of the domestic liftboat fleet which occurred during the fourth quarter of the remaining gain on disposition of assets  net in and also includes gains or losses related to various real property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment 
other income  net 
other income  net in of million primarily includes proceeds of approximately million from a litigation settlement in the first quarter of the remaining other income  net in and also includes gains from various other legal and insurance claims 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income was thousand in compared to net interest expense of thousand in the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the reduction in outstanding debt through annual principal payments made during and  and thousand of interest income related to income tax refunds received during the fourth quarter of income tax provision 
the effective tax rate was percent in and percent in adjustments of million in resulted in an income tax benefit of percent related to income tax refunds received primarily during the fourth quarter of adjustments of million in resulted in an income tax benefit of percent primarily related to the recognition of previously reserved foreign tax credit carryovers and an adjustment to the liability for foreign taxes 
net income and diluted earnings per share 
net income for was million  or earnings per diluted share 
this included a million after tax gain  or per diluted share  related to the sale of the operating and intangible assets of the hammer  casing  laydown and casing torque turn service lines 
net income for was million or earnings per diluted share  and included a pre tax gain of million related to the sale of the domestic liftboat fleet 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased percent compared to domestic revenues increased due to higher customer drilling and production enhancement activity 
our growth in revenues was higher than the domestic rig count growth  principally because of the effect of increased international revenues  of an acquisition closed during  and of our fishing tool service line which began operations in these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in the gulf of mexico market  exacerbated by the hurricanes in the area during the third quarter  heavy rains during the fourth quarter impacting mid continent operations  and the sale of one of our non oilfield businesses during the second quarter of the average price of natural gas increased percent during compared to  and the average price of oil increased percent during the same period 
the average us domestic rig count increased by percent during compared to this increase in oil and gas prices and resulting increase in drilling activity had a positive impact on our financial results 
we believe that our activity levels are affected more by the price of natural gas than by the price of oil  because the majority of us domestic drilling activity relates to natural gas  and many of our services are more appropriate for gas wells than oil wells 
the correlation between the changes in the price of oil and natural gas and us domestic drilling activity were more highly correlated in than in this higher correlation is consistent with past industry cycles 
the technical services segment revenues for increased percent due primarily to increased customer activity levels and demand for our services  additional equipment capacity  higher pricing levels in most of our service lines and a shift in the mix of pressure pumping work towards higher revenue generating jobs 
the support services segment revenues for increased percent as a result of higher equipment utilization  additional capacity and slightly higher pricing in rental tools  which is the largest service line within this segment  partially offset by lower utilization and reduced pricing for the marine liftboats 
cost of services rendered and goods sold 
cost of services rendered and goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  decreased five percentage points in compared to as a result of improved operating leverage due to overall higher utilization of personnel and operating equipment  and better pricing 
cost of services rendered and goods sold increased percent due primarily to increased direct employment costs  and variable operational expenses such as equipment maintenance  materials and supplies  sub rental expense and fuel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by percent to million in from million in  however as a percentage of revenues  remained relatively stable at percent 
the increase was due to increased incentive compensation costs and increased headcount related to higher activity levels and the expansion of our safety program 
the increase was also due to the implementation of additional information technology to support operational efficiencies at higher activity levels and an increase in bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization were million in  a percent increase compared to million in this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from various maintenance and growth capital expenditures within support services and technical services  and from the effect of the acquisition completed during the second quarter of as a percentage of revenues these costs declined due to their fixed nature 
gain on disposition of assets  net 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold the company s domestic liftboat fleet which generated a pre tax gain of million 
this transaction generated proceeds of approximately million 
gain on disposition of assets  net also includes gains in and related to miscellaneous real property dispositions and sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment 
other income  net 
other income  net was million in and million in and primarily includes gains from various legal and insurance claim settlements 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net was thousand in compared to thousand in income tax provision 
the effective tax rate in was percent  a reduction from percent in  primarily because of an aggregate reduction in the tax provision of approximately million related to the recognition of previously reserved foreign tax credit carryovers and an adjustment to the liabilities for foreign taxes 
net income and diluted earnings per share 
net income for was million  or earnings per diluted share 
this included the million after tax gain  or per diluted share  related to the sale of the liftboats and million  or per diluted share  related to the tax provision adjustments 
net income for was million or earnings per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the year ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the large improvement in operating results and increased gains on sale of assets was partially offset by higher working capital requirements and a lower cash contribution to the defined benefit pension plan in compared to increased business activity levels and revenues resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventories which was partially offset by higher accounts payable 
also  the company received income tax refunds of million in that did not occur in cash used for investing activities in increased by million compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures to increase capacity and maintain our existing equipment and an increase of million in compared to in earnout payments for acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of assets 
cash used for financing activities in increased by million compared to  due to increased cost of open market share repurchases of company common stock  a percent increase in dividends paid to common shareholders  and principal repayments totaling million during the first and third quarters of cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the large improvement in operating results was offset by a million cash contribution to the defined benefit pension plan  receipt of large income tax refunds in that did not recur in  and higher working capital requirements 
increased revenues resulted in an increase in accounts receivable which was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities 
cash used in investing activities for increased by million compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sale of property and equipment  including the sale of the liftboats  and a decrease in cash used for purchases of businesses 
cash used for purchases of businesses in includes earnout payments of million related to operating results 
cash used for purchases of businesses in included a business acquisition  there were no earnout payments in cash used in financing activities for increased by million compared to  due to increases in dividends paid per share and debt service requirements  partially offset by increases in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
financial condition and liquidity the company s financial condition as of december   remains strong 
we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents  our overall strong capitalization  and cash expected to be generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the portion of the credit facility that is not currently available supports letters of credit relating to self insurance programs or contract bids 
subsequent to year end  the company sought and received an increase in its available credit facility from million to million with a financial institution 
as of december   million of our facility was allocated to letters of credit supporting self insurance programs or performance bonds 
for additional information with respect to rpc s credit facility  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position  availability of credit facilities  and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
we believe our liquidity will continue to provide the opportunity to grow our asset base and revenues during periods with positive business conditions and strong customer activity levels 
cash requirements capital expenditures were million in  and we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect these expenditures to be primarily directed towards revenue producing equipment in our larger  core service lines including pressure pumping  snubbing  nitrogen  and rental tools 
the actual amount of expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements  expansion opportunities  and equipment delivery schedules 
the company s retirement income plan  a multiple employer trusteed defined benefit pension plan  provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age to eligible employees 
during the first quarter of  the company contributed million to the pension plan 
we expect that additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of approximately million will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
the company s board of directors announced a stock buyback program on march  authorizing the repurchase of  shares 
the company expects to continue repurchasing outstanding common shares periodically based on market conditions and our capital allocation strategies 
the program does not have a predetermined expiration date 
on january  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend per common share  from to  payable march  to stockholders of record at the close of business february  based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual dividends expected to be paid would be approximately million in the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
in accordance with the respective purchase agreements  earnout payments to sellers of two businesses previously acquired by the company have been paid on an annual basis and were paid on an interim period ending during the company made earnout payments of million in april related to operating results 
final earnout payments of million in the second quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of were made to the sellers of acquired businesses based on the results for the interim period ended june  as of december   all earnout obligations under these purchase agreements have been recognized and paid 
contractual obligations the company s obligations and commitments that require future payments include a bank demand note  certain non cancelable operating leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations operating leases include agreements for various office locations  office equipment  and certain operating equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payments are known 
these amounts include primarily known pension plan funding obligations and incentive compensation 
these amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
inflation the company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices 
due to the recent increases in activity in the domestic oilfield  the company has experienced some upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees 
if inflation in the general economy increases  the company s costs for equipment  materials and labor could increase as well 
also the price of steel  for both the commodity and for products manufactured with steel  has increased dramatically due to increased worldwide demand 
although prices have moderated  they remain high by historical standards 
this factor has affected the company s operations through delays in scheduled deliveries of new equipment and price quotations that were only valid for a limited period of time 
if this factor continues  it is possible that the cost of the company s new equipment will increase which would result in higher capital expenditures and depreciation expense 
rpc may not be able to recover such increased costs through price increases to its customers  thereby reducing the company s future profits 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
related party transactions marine products corporation effective february   the company spun off the business conducted through chaparral boats  inc chaparral  rpc s former powerboat manufacturing segment 
rpc accomplished the spin off by contributing percent of the issued and outstanding stock of chaparral to marine products corporation a delaware corporation marine products  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of rpc  and then distributing the common stock of marine products to rpc stockholders 
in conjunction with the spin off  rpc and marine products entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship 
in accordance with a transition support services agreement  which may be terminated by either party  rpc provides certain administrative services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products 
charges from the company or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the company for such services aggregated approximately  in   in and  in the company s directors are also directors of marine products and all of the executive officers are employees of both the company and marine products 
the tax sharing and indemnification agreement provides for  among other things  the treatment of income tax matters for periods through february   the date of the spin off  and responsibility for any adjustments as a result of audits by any taxing authority 
the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
in accordance with the agreement  rpc transferred approximately  in to marine products for tax settlements 
other the company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business products or services from suppliers  who are owned by significant officers or shareholders  or affiliated with the directors of rpc 
the total amounts paid to these affiliated parties were approximately  in   in and  in in addition  the overhead crane fabrication division of rpc sold april recorded  in in revenues from the powerboat manufacturing segment that is now a subsidiary of marine products pursuant to the spin off  related to the sale  installation and service of overhead cranes 
rpc receives certain administrative services and rents office space from rollins  inc a company of which mr 
r 
randall rollins is also chairman and which is otherwise affiliated with rpc 
the service agreements between rollins  inc and the company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months notice 
the services covered by these agreements include office space  administration of certain employee benefit programs  and other administrative services 
charges to the company or to corporations which are subsidiaries of the company for such services and rent totaled to  in   in and  in critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve estimates that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of the company s receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the united states  selected international locations and foreign  nationally owned oil companies 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers 
our customers ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected 
significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery 
therefore  the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in  the company recorded two large recoveries of previously charged off amounts 
there were no large recoveries in and we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted  either upward or downward 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry  financial condition of our customers  our historical write off experience  current economic conditions  and in the case of international customers  our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region 
in addition to reserves established for specific customers  we establish general reserves by using different percentages depending on the age of the receivables 
excluding the effect of the recoveries referred to above  the annual provisions for doubtful accounts have ranged from percent to percent of revenues over the last three years 
increasing or decreasing the estimated general reserve percentages by percentage points as of december  would have resulted in a change of approximately million to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a corresponding change to selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized  and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
we establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
insurance expenses the company self insures  up to certain policy specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment liability 
the cost of claims under these self insurance programs is estimated and accrued using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience  however  the ultimate cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
the company has retained an independent third party actuary to assist in the calculation of a range of exposure for these claims 
as of december   the company estimates the range of exposure to be from million to million 
the company has recorded liabilities at december  of approximately million which represents management s best estimate of probable loss 
depreciable life of assets rpc s net property  plant and equipment at december  was million representing percent of the company s consolidated assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were million  or percent of total operating costs 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated useful lives used to calculate the annual and accumulated depreciation and amortization expense 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization  which is generally provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets 
assets are monitored to ensure changes in asset lives  are identified and prospective depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted accordingly 
we have not made changes to the estimated lives of assets resulting in a material impact in the last three years 
defined benefit pension plan in  the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan  although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march the company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs 
with the assistance of the actuary  the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets  the discount rate  and other factors  and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes  the investments strategy  and the views of our investment adviser 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is percent which is unchanged from the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations 
the company determined a discount rate of percent as of december   compared to a discount rate of percent in and percent in in  the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased stockholders equity by thousand after tax 
holding all other factors constant  a decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an after tax increase of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive loss and an increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an after tax decrease of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company recognized pre tax pension expense of million in  million in  and million in pension expense is anticipated to increase slightly to approximately million in holding all other factors constant  a change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of approximately million in holding all other factors constant  a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of approximately million in new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods available are the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective application 
under the modified retrospective application  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective application would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
sfas no 
r states that the requirement is to adopt the provisions in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a new rule that allows companies to implement statement no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s view regarding the valuation of shared based payment arrangements for public companies 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fas r 
fas r provides for a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
companies may elect either the guidance in sfas no 
r or this alternative transition method up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to make this one time election 
the company will implement the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently uses apb s intrinsic value method and recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation 
the impact of sfas r would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our audited financial statements  if we had adopted it earlier 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future partly because the company cannot predict the stock prices when i the employees exercise non qualified options or ii the restricted stock vests 
also  under the provision of fas r  unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards are not recorded 
accordingly  any remaining unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards and the corresponding amount in paid in capital will no longer be included in stockholders equity beginning january  based on stock options and restricted stock granted to employees through december   the company expects that the adoption of sfas r on january   will reduce first quarter net income by approximately  see note for further information on the company s stock based compensation plans 
the cumulative amount of excess tax deductions related to share based payment awards to employees computed in accordance with the provisions of sfas r is approximately  as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
by focusing the exception on exchanges that lack commercial substance  sfas intends to produce financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of the transaction 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  and the provisions are to be applied prospectively 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas resulting in no material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  issued in december  is intended to provide limited relief in the application of the indefinite reinvestment criterion due to ambiguities surrounding the implementation of the act 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
the company has completed its evaluation of fsp and has repatriated earnings of approximately million 
the cash distribution will be treated as an extraordinary dividend and will qualify for the percent dividends received deduction drd within the meaning of code section the company implemented its repatriation plan late in the fourth quarter of starting with the reinvestment of the money back into the united states 
in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and has been adopted by the company in the fiscal year ended december  adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company 
in may  the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle or a change required by a new accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented based on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  the company plans to adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company

management s report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of rpc  inc the management of rpc  inc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 
rpc  inc maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance  at a reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures  an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel 
this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any controls system 
a controls system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met 
also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls 
under the supervision and with the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
based on this evaluation  management s assessment is that rpc  inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  the independent registered public accounting firm  grant thornton llp  has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and has also issued their report on management s assessment of the company s internal control over financial reporting  included in this report on page s richard a

rpc  inc s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  management s assessment that rpc  inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the coso 
also in our opinion  rpc  inc maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the coso 
we have also audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of rpc  inc and subsidiaries as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended december  and our report dated march  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
