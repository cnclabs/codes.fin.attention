industry background until the mid s  video images and audio soundtracks were transmitted  edited and stored almost exclusively using analog formats 
since then  advances in technology have allowed audio and video to be processed and stored in digital form 
unlike analog formats  which are inherently unstable and difficult to edit and enhance  digital formats permit the manipulation of audio and video signals through digital signal processing and offer a number of fundamental advantages over analog technologies 
through complex digital signal processing operations  digital audio and video signals may be compressed  providing significant storage and transmission efficiencies 
they also may be filtered  allowing for noise reduction  and they may be transmitted and reproduced without perceptible image or sound degradation 
digital formats provide users with additional benefits  including random access to data  superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying and controlled and secure access 
one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of digital technology had been the huge amount of data required to represent images and sounds in a digital format  making cost effective storage or transmission impractical 
through digital compression techniques  a substantial number of the redundancies inherent in audio and video data can be identified and eliminated  significantly reducing the overall amount of data which needs to be retained 
compression techniques introduced in the early s allowed a two hour movie to be compressed and stored on only two video cds with video resolution comparable to that of a standard vhs tape 
more recent techniques allow the storage of a full length movie of more than three hours on a single dvd  with substantially improved audio and video quality and the incorporation of additional data  such as additional languages  scenes and director and actor commentary 
additionally  digital compression of video data allows previously unmanageable amounts of data to be stored in the memory of a disk drive  thereby permitting the data to be accessed and edited easily 
it also allows for easier transmission of sharper resolution pictures through a standard definition or high definition television or set top box 
digital audio compression allows efficient storage and delivery of multi channel audio  making possible high quality special effects such as multi channel surround sound  virtual surround sound and wireless audio delivery via two speakers or headphones 
in the field of still photography  digital compression allows dozens or hundreds of digital pictures to be stored on a single memory card  depending on the resolution desired 
to drive the implementation and speed the adoption of products based on digital formats  industry participants organized committees to define international compression standards 
the principal standards in use today include the following the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  standard for the high quality compression of still images and the real time  low cost compression and decompression of moving images  the mpeg standard  adopted by the moving pictures experts group  or mpeg  for the compression of both audio and video data at the high compression ratios necessary for the limited storage capacity of the cd rom format  the mpeg standard  subsequently adopted by the motion pictures experts group  for the compression of both audio and video data  designed to provide improved quality in broadcast and video playback applications  the mpeg standard  which is an extension of mpeg and mpeg that provides the ability to view  access and manipulate objects rather than pixels  which is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  mobile multimedia and video game applications 
mpeg part standard  also known as advanced video codec avc or h  is a recent addition to the mpeg standard  offering significantly improved compression efficiencies  divx standard  which is a proprietary codec similar to mpeg used for encoding high quality digital video at low bit rates 
divx encoded content can be viewed on the pc with a software player  on select dvd players  portable media players and is used by some internet based video on demand services  windows media  microsoft s standard digital media software platform for developing digital media products and services  and dolby digital  developed by dolby laboratories  an industry standard for the compression of audio for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 
these industry standard techniques have enabled the dramatic growth in digital multimedia markets  including the following dvd players and recorders 
dvd players and recorders primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback or recording than is possible with vcr or video cd technology 
according to international data corporation  or idc  sales of dvd players totaled approximately million units in and shipments of dvd recorders increased to over million units  from a base of million units in dvd recorders are expected to gradually overtake the dvd player in combination products  such as dvd vcr  dvd htib and tv dvd 
standard definition and high definition televisions and set top boxes 
digital televisions receive digital content and process that content to display a picture which has far greater resolution and sharper  more clearly defined images than televisions based on the older analog technology 
standard definition televisions generally contain lines with pixels per line 
high definition television  or hdtv  television sets contain to pixels per line and up to lines 
the aspect ratio of standard definition sets is  compared to for hdtv 
the lines may be displayed using different techniques  often referred to as interlacing or alternatively progressive scan 
the functionality to receive and process digital television signals can be contained in a set top box which then drives a television display that is capable of displaying digital content 
alternatively  this functionality can be integrated into a digital television that does not require a set top box 
digital content is broadcast via satellite  cable networks or over the air terrestrial broadcast in various markets throughout the world 
intex management services  ltd  or ims  estimates that over million digital televisions and set top boxes were shipped worldwide in and that over million units will be shipped in mobile products 
digital cameras use jpeg compression technology to capture high resolution still images that can be viewed  edited and stored on a computer system on a recordable dvd and transmitted over telephone lines and computer networks 
recently  digital cameras have been introduced that are capable of capturing and playing back quality video  using the mpeg algorithm 
according to idc  sales of mega pixel digital cameras exceeded million units in and are expected to exceed million units during the multimedia mobile phone market segment is expected to increase from million units in to about million units in  according to idc 
additional products and markets are developing based on these established compression standards and additional compression technologies such as meridian lossless pcm  or mlp  a new standard for dvd audio  super audio  or sacd  microsoft windows media audio  or wma  advanced audio codec aac used in conjunction with the mpeg video standard and mp  a compression standard for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
these established and emerging compression standards specify data formats in which compressed data must be presented in order to enable products from different vendors to interact and permit the capture  transmission  storage and display of audio and video data in digital format 
these standards do not specify the compression methodologies to be employed or additional functionality which may be used to enhance or manipulate digital signals 
these standards  therefore  do not determine image or sound quality or compression efficiency 
for example  data compression may comply with relevant standards despite being poorly processed and containing artifacts which result in image degradation in video applications or poor sound quality in audio applications 
as a result  there can be significant differences in overall image or sound quality between two solutions based on the same standard 
therefore  integrated circuit manufacturers can differentiate their products on the basis of the quality of their compression solution 
historically  as system vendors sought compression solutions  the cost  complexity and time required to compress and decompress data have imposed significant limitations on the use of digital compression 
over the last several years  as cost effective compression solutions have emerged  product manufacturers have increasingly sought to design and market lower cost digital audio and video systems and products to address an increasing number of high volume consumer applications 
in addition  product manufacturers are facing competitive pressure to introduce their products more rapidly 
to address these issues  oems continually seek to integrate more and more functions on individual chips in order to reduce their costs  speed time to market and produce smaller products with reduced power consumption 
they also seek solutions that can be easily integrated into their commercial and consumer products 
the current challenge to manufacturers of compression integrated circuits is  therefore  to provide product manufacturers with high quality  cost effective  standards based solutions that deliver flexible control  image enhancement  audio effects and other functions in addition to high quality compression solutions

we have also established long term relationships with strategic partners that provide manufacturing capacity and will seek to develop additional strategic relationships with manufacturers 
markets and applications our products are currently used in a variety of consumer multimedia applications  including the following consumer video playback systems dvd players primarily use mpeg video compression and dolby digital or similar audio technology to provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with earlier generation products such as vcrs  video cd or super video cd players 
dvd players are sold as stand alone products and are also bundled with other functions including dvd vcr combinations  dvd receivers and dvd tv combinations 
in addition  the dvd player can act as a platform for playback and editing of digital still images from digital cameras through integrated memory card slots or via direct connection to digital cameras 
digital video recording systems digital video recording systems are expected to replace the analog vcr 
digital video recording systems not only store home movies and tv programs but allow them to be easily edited 
in addition  digital video recording systems enable high quality time shifting of tv program viewing by recording the program so that it can be watched simultaneously or on a delayed basis 
the recording media used in digital video recording systems includes dvd recordable media and hard disks 
digital video recording systems use mpeg as the video compression format and dolby digital or mpeg audio as the audio format 
digital television the digital television market represents the most significant technological shift in the television segment of the consumer electronics market since color televisions were introduced in the late s 
in the digital television market  digital content providers broadcast programming via satellite  cable or terrestrial over the air networks 
the mix of broadcast networks varies by geographic region 
for example  most digital television content in japan and korea is broadcast via terrestrial networks  while cable networks currently predominate in the united states 
satellite networks offer an alternative source of content to consumers and are continuing to grow in each of these markets 
each geographic market is subject to regulation that requires compliance with different governmental standards applicable to broadcast technology and content format 
in each market  individual broadcasters also have developed their own proprietary standards for content  security and conditional access 
the digital television market requires television products  set top boxes  personal video recorders and other digital consumer appliances to include sophisticated integrated circuits and embedded software that address the emerging requirements of multiple broadcast networks throughout the world 
the requirement by the us federal communications commission  or fcc  that all new televisions contain a built in digital receiver  has accelerated the growth of the digital television market  which we expect to continue over the next several years 
digital imaging print products the market for personal printers is beginning to undergo a shift from traditional pc centric peripherals toward new pc independent printing appliances 
fueling this shift is the rapid growth of digital photography  home internet and wireless connectivity 
as these new technologies make their way into the home  they are creating demand for a new class of appliance type printers that allow image rich content such as web pages  digital photos  and scanned documents to be printed without using a pc 
according to idc  ic controllers for multifunction print devices are addressing a market estimated at million units in and growing to over million units in the market for embedded software for page description languages is somewhat more mature than other areas of the imaging market 
it is characterized by a small number of suppliers selling to very large oem customers designing print devices that need to be connected to a network 
the page description language  or pdl  enables the printer to receive a file or job from a pc and translate that file into a set of instructions that the printer can understand and lay down on paper with a great deal of precision 
in general  applications are designed to send jobs to printers using one or both of two major protocols or languages 
print control language  or pcl  originated as a hewlett packard developed protocol for page printers and has become an industry standard in office environments 
in addition  the application may also use postscript based protocols originally developed by adobe  which tend to be focused more on graphic arts and apple operating system environments 
mobile products digital cameras allow the capture of high resolution images  the viewing  editing and storage of such images on a computer system and their transmission over telephone lines and computer networks 
high quality copies of these images can be printed using color printers 
recently  digital cameras have added video capture and compression capability enabling them to provide basic camcorder functionality 
digital cameras can be connected directly to a pc for downloading of pictures or movies and to a television for display 
the original digital cameras were developed for the professional market  and these cameras currently sell at prices of  to  as technology has advanced and manufacturing costs have decreased  digital cameras for the consumer market have been introduced in the to price range 
many mobile telephones now incorporate digital still camera functionality  including high resolution still pictures and sometimes even video clips 
these phones can be connected to a pc for downloading the pictures or video clips or they can be transmitted over the mobile phone network to another mobile phone or sent to an e mail account 
digital camera functionality was originally included in mobile phones that sold for to with the spread of the technology and decreased manufacturing costs  digital camera enabled mobile phones now are available in every price range 
image and video technology the jpeg standard 
in  the joint photographic experts group  or jpeg  committee of the international standards organization completed a technical specification for a standard to compress individual digitized images  which may consist of still images or consecutive frames of video data 
jpeg has been widely adopted for video editing applications  since each frame in the video is individually compressed  allowing cutting and pasting of sequences as well as modification of individual frames 
images are compressed through elimination of spatial redundancies within an image and the filtering of high frequency areas to which the eye is less sensitive 
using these techniques  the jpeg compression standard is able to reduce the data necessary to represent an image without significant degradation of image quality 
still images or motion video can be compressed to varying degrees using jpeg  with greater compression resulting in lower quality 
typically  four to one or five to one compression yields broadcast image quality while to compression is similar to vhs quality 
zoran jpeg technology 
our jpeg technology incorporates a proprietary bit rate control algorithm that enables our jpeg based products to compress any image to a predetermined size while optimizing video quality using pre selected parameters 
without this feature  the jpeg compression process results in compressed data files of various sizes based on the actual content of the original image given a constant degree of compression 
an image with large amounts of visual detail will generate a larger data file than that generated from an image with less detail 
performance of many video applications is hampered by variability in the size of the compressed images in a video sequence  which can result in inefficient use of available memory  bus speed or communication channel capacity or even the loss of images 
our bit rate control is a standards plus solution that uses real time digital signal processing algorithms to optimize video quality based on pre selected parameters  which can be programmed by oems  without the loss of any image or video frame 
our bit rate control has been incorporated in our jpeg based devices that are used in digital cameras  video editing systems  color scanners  pc based security systems  video conferencing and other applications 
other features of our jpeg based products include their ability to handle a wide range of compression ratios  to perform a lossless compression algorithm in the same jpeg device  to rapidly scan or browse a large number of images and utilize advanced image processing algorithms that enable bit rate control of usb data  vertical blank interval detection  infrared remote control detection and scene analysis for computer control applications 
we implement these functions in a single integrated circuit while we believe most other manufacturers either offer fewer functions or require multiple chips  resulting in higher manufacturing costs and greater power consumption 
the mpeg standards 
in  the moving pictures expert group  or mpeg  committee of the international standards organization completed a technical specification for a standard to compress moving audio and video into a single data stream 
like jpeg  mpeg removes spatial redundancies from single frames of video data 
mpeg improves on jpeg by also removing redundancies that occur between consecutive video frames 
because video represents movement  it is possible to detect and estimate the movement of similar picture elements between video frames  a process called motion estimation 
mpeg motion estimation uses the content of previous and future frames to predict the content of the current frame without using its full content 
mpeg implements audio compression by exploiting psycho acoustic masking  taking advantage of the fact that the ear is less sensitive to a quiet note at one frequency when a much louder note is present at a nearby frequency 
mpeg often achieves audio compression ratios of six to one and video compression ratios of over to mpeg is particularly suitable for low cost cd rom applications due to its low cost implementation 
in  the mpeg video committee completed a technical specification to address the more stringent requirements of the broadcast industry 
mpeg provides more sophisticated prediction techniques  enabling a compression solution to comprehend video as interlaced fields of data  rather than individual frames 
mpeg also allows for operation at higher resolution and at higher bit rates than mpeg  resulting in improved image quality for high motion  high detail video 
mpeg typically achieves compression ratios of to because of its higher bit rate  mpeg technology cannot be used in standard cd rom applications  but can be used in dvd players 
mpeg builds on the experience of the mpeg and mpeg standards  which are currently used in digital video applications 
mpeg is rich in features  and can be customized to serve the needs of specific industries while preserving a high level of interoperability across a variety of applications 
it allows a new level of interaction with visual content  providing the ability to view access and manipulate objects rather than pixels 
mpeg s impact is especially significant in video streaming  digital television  and game applications 
divx 
divx is a proprietary codec similar to mpeg used for encoding high quality digital video at low bit rates 
divx encoded content can be viewed on the pc with a software player and on select dvd players and portable media players and is used by some internet based video on demand services 
zoran mpeg technology 
beginning in  we established ourselves as a leading provider of mpeg technology for dvd and super video cd applications 
another important technology is mpeg decoding  which is embodied in the divx and xvid file formats 
these files are commonly used for file sharing of video content on the pc 
we have added to the mpeg decoders used on the pc the capability to decode mpeg files  allowing consumers to display content stored on their pcs using a television 
we have also introduced mpeg encoding ics 
this technology is an important part of the dvd recorder system 
with the acquisition of oak technologies we obtained the mpeg technologies required for high definition television applications including set top boxes and televisions 
we have also developed mpeg technology both for compression and decompression enabling the capture and playback of high quality video clips for portable applications including digital still cameras and digital tape less camcorders 
with the acquisition of emblaze semiconductor  we obtained mpeg part compression and decompression technologies  also known as the advanced video codec  or avc  that are used in mobile telephone applications for video conferencing and video capture 
audio technology the dolby digital standard 
in  dolby laboratories launched dolby digital  an audio compression technique which has emerged as an industry standard 
dolby digital was developed as a successor to dolby s pro logic analog technique for use in multi channel digital surround sound systems 
it is currently used in most movie theaters in the developed nations worldwide and is also used in home theater and computer multimedia applications 
digital compression of audio data allows the storage of full quality multi channel audio playback in the limited space allocated for audio in video oriented formats 
it also facilitates the seamless integration of sound with compressed video 
the dolby digital audio compression standard is currently the principal audio compression technique used in dvd players 
dolby digital has also been adopted as a standard for use in high definition television and digital cable systems 
other audio standards 
other digital audio compression standards currently in use include dts  an audio compression standard that competes with dolby digital  mlp  a compression standard for dvd audio  windows media audio  or wma  a standard developed by microsoft  advance audio codec  or aac  a compression standard used in hdtv and mp  used for the download of audio recordings from the internet 
zoran audio technology 
working closely with dolby laboratories  we have developed a programmable audio digital signal processing engine with an architecture optimized for dolby digital and other demanding audio applications  and we were the first to develop a single chip solution for dolby digital decoding 
our family of vaddis dvd decoders and audio processors incorporate this engine to allow systems manufacturers to replace system components with software modules  differentiate their products from their competition  use zoran s siliconsoftware library of advanced audio algorithms  and reduce system costs and time to market

research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness and compliance with new standards in rapidly evolving consumer oriented digital audio and video markets 
we attempt to leverage our expertise in the fields of digital signal processing  integrated circuit design  algorithms and software development to maintain our position as a leader in the development of digital audio  video and imaging solutions 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our resources to maintaining and upgrading our products to reduce integrated circuit cost  feature size  power consumption and the number of integrated circuits required to perform compression and other functions necessary for the evolving digital audio  video and imaging application markets 
in addition  we seek to design integrated circuits and cores  as well as near production ready reference designs which can reduce the time needed by manufacturers to integrate our ics into their own products 
we have historically generated a portion of our revenues from development contracts with our strategic partners 
these development contracts provide that we will receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones and that we will retain ownership of the intellectual property developed 
development contracts have enabled us to fund portions of our product development efforts  to respond to the feature requirements of our customers  to accelerate the incorporation of our products into our customers products and to accelerate the time to market of our customers products 
we anticipate  however  that in the future development contracts with strategic partners will fund a smaller portion of our development efforts than in the past 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states bi national industrial research and development foundation 
these organizations fund up to of incurred project costs for approved projects up to contract maximums 
the agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of the total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
in  we earned grants totaling million 
there were no grant receipts in the terms of israeli government participation include restrictions on the location of research and development activities  and the terms of the grants from the chief scientist prohibit the transfer of technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the chief scientist 
as of december   we had a staff of full time  part time and contract research and development personnel for a total of research and development personnel 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to focus on providing solutions to manufacturers seeking to design audio  video and imaging products for existing and emerging high volume consumer applications 
in cooperation with leading manufacturers of audio  video and imaging equipment in the commercial and consumer markets  we attempt to identify market segments which have the potential for substantial growth 
to implement our strategy  we have established a worldwide direct sales force in several sales and marketing offices located near our key customers and strategic partners  and a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and resellers 
in some cases  our strategic partners also provide sales and marketing support 
we work closely in the product development process with strategic partners to incorporate our integrated circuits and software into their products 
potential products are designed to meet customer specific product requirements defined jointly by us and our strategic partners with our partners providing technological input  and in some cases  a portion of the development funding 
this strategy has permitted us to develop products with substantial financial and other assistance  while retaining ownership of the technology and ensuring an established customer for the product once development is completed 
in addition  our application engineers assist customers in designing their products to incorporate our integrated circuits 
our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date 
we sell our products primarily through our person direct sales staff  of whom are located in the united states and are located internationally 
our united states sales staff is primarily responsible for sales in north america  europe and south america 
sales management and sales operations staff also reside in the united states 
our marketing staffs in china  japan  korea and taiwan are responsible for marketing in their respective regions 
in addition  we sell our products indirectly through five commissioned sales representatives as well as selected resellers 
we typically warrant our products for a month period 
to date  we have not experienced material product returns or warranty expense 
we have opened offices in other parts of the world in order to better address specific markets 
during  we opened an office in shenzhen  china as part of our effort to capture a leadership position in the chinese digital audio and video markets 
during  we opened an office in taipei  taiwan in an effort to better address the digital camera market 
as of december   we had a staff of employees and contractors in our china office and employees in our taiwan office  including sales  applications and customer support employees 
in addition  in we opened offices in hong kong and korea  which had staffs of employees and employees  respectively  as of december  these offices also provide sales  applications and customer support 
we distribute our products in japan primarily through resellers 
we also operate an office in tokyo to help promote our products in japan  assist with the marketing of products not sold through resellers  such as integrated circuit cores and certain digital camera  digital video  digital television  imaging and jpeg products  and provide applications support for some of our customers 
at december   we had employees and contractors in our tokyo office 
we sell our dolby technology enabled products under a perpetual  non exclusive license from dolby to sell products that incorporate the dolby digital algorithm 
we are not required to pay license fees or royalties to dolby under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dolby  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dolby 
under our agreement with dolby  we may sell our dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for our dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our sales 
we sell our dts technology based products under a non exclusive license from dts technology llc to sell products that incorporate the dts algorithm 
we are not required to pay royalties to dts technology under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dts  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dts 
under our agreement with dts  we may sell our dts based products only to customers who are licensees of dts 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dts in the future could harm our sales 
backlog sales of our products are made pursuant to firm purchase orders 
however  sometimes we allow customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to price renegotiations and to changes in quantities of products ordered as a result of changes in customers requirements and manufacturing availability 
our ability to order products can carry lead times of between four and weeks  however  most of our business is characterized by short lead times and quick delivery schedules 
as a result of these factors  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future sales 
manufacturing we contract our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing to independent foundries and contractors  which enables us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing facilities 
our engineers work closely with our foundry partners and subcontractors to increase yields  lower manufacturing costs and assure quality 
our primary foundry is taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  which has manufactured integrated circuits for us since tsmc  philips and samsung are currently manufacturing our dvd  jpeg  dtv  imaging and some of our mobile products 
fujitsu manufactures our usb multimedia controller chips 
our independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
all of our devices are currently fabricated using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor process technology with micron to micron feature sizes 
most of our semiconductor products are currently being assembled by one of five independent contractors and tested by those contractors or other independent contractors 
we currently purchase products from all of our foundries under individually negotiated purchase orders 
we do not currently have a long term supply contract with tsmc  and therefore tsmc is not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
competition our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater resources in the following areas finance  manufacturing  technology  marketing  and distribution 
some of these competitors also have broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we do 
some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from capacity  cost and technical advantages 
ali corporation  broadcom  cheertek  cirrus logic  ess  lsi logic  matsushita  mediatek  nec  sigmadesigns  sony  stmicroelectronics  sunplus and texas instruments have introduced integrated audio and video devices for dvd applications 
in the markets for jpeg based products for use in digital cameras  our principal competitors are in house solutions developed and used by major japanese oems  as well as products sold by sunplus and texas instruments 
in the market for jpeg based products for desktop video editing applications  our principal competitor is sunplus 
cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  fujitsu  motorola  stmicroelectronics and yamaha are currently shipping dolby digital based audio compression products 
our principal competitors for digital semiconductor devices in the digital television market include ati technologies  broadcom  conexant and st microelectronics 
others who also participate in this market are ali corporation  fujitsu  genesis microchip  haier  ibm  lsi  nec  philips  sigmatel  inc  peerless systems  tak imaging and in house captive suppliers 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for high performance audio  video and imaging technology depends on a number of factors  including the following price  quality  performance and features of our products  the timing and success of new product introductions by itself  our customers and our competitors  the emergence of new industry standards  its ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  declining average unit selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions which may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products 
we believe that growth of the dvd player market will be modest in the forseeable future  and that continued strong competition in that market will lead to further price reductions  and reduced profit margins 
we believe that the dvd recorder market will continue to grow and that as technology barriers become higher  fewer competitors will enter this market 
historically  average unit selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
we expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures 
in order to offset expected declines in the average unit selling prices of our products  we will need to continually reduce the cost of our products and continue to integrate additional functions into our ics 
we intend to accomplish this by implementing design changes that integrate additional functionality  lower the cost of manufacturing  assembly and testing  by negotiating reduced charges by our foundries as and if volumes increase  and by successfully managing our manufacturing and subcontracting relationships 
since we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities 
if we fail to introduce lower cost versions of our products in a timely manner or to successfully manage our manufacturing  assembly and testing relationships  our business would be harmed 
proprietary rights and licenses our ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information 
although we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and licensing arrangements to protect some of our intellectual property  we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  resellers  customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information 
we currently hold approximately patents worldwide  and have additional patent applications pending 
our intellectual property rights  if challenged  may not be upheld as valid  may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future 
in particular  the existence of several consortiums that license patents relating to the mpeg standard has created uncertainty with respect to the use and enforceability of patents implementing that standard 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
we sell our dolby digital based products under a perpetual non exclusive license from dolby which permits us to incorporate the dolby digital algorithm into our products 
our customers enter into license agreements with dolby pursuant to which they pay royalties directly to dolby 
under our agreement with dolby  we may sell our dolby digital based products only to customers who are licensees of dolby 
to date  most potential customers for our dolby digital based products are licensees of dolby 
however  the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our business 
we sell our dts technology based products under a non exclusive license from dts technology llc to sell products that incorporate the dts algorithm 
we are not required to pay royalties to dts under this agreement 
our customers enter into license agreements directly with dts  pursuant to which they pay royalties to dts 
under our agreement with dts  we may sell our dts based products only to customers who are licensees of dts 
the failure or refusal of potential customers to enter into license agreements with dolby in the future could harm our sales 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we or our foundries from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we have been subject to intellectual property claims and litigation in the past  and we and our oak subsidiary were recently engaged in such litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future 
in particular  given the uncertainty discussed above regarding patents relating to the mpeg standard  it is difficult for us to assess the possibility that our activities in the mpeg field may give rise to future patent infringement claims 
litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that it uses  we could incur substantial liabilities and be forced to suspend the manufacture of products  or the use by our foundries of certain processes 
employees as of december   we had  full time and part time and contract employees  including full time  part time and contract employees primarily involved in research and development activities  in marketing and sales  in finance  human resources  information systems  legal and administration  and in manufacturing control and quality assurance 
we have full time employees and part time and contract employees based in israel  of which employees  including both full time and contract employees  are involved in engineering and research and development 
we have full time employees and part time and contract employees at our facilities in sunnyvale  california  full time employees and part time and contract employees at our facility in woburn massachusetts  and full time employees and part time contract employees at our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china 
the remaining employees are located in our international offices in canada  england  germany  hong kong  japan  korea and taiwan 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
item a risk factors our future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our annual revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the prices of our stock 
our historical operating results have varied significantly from year over year due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and our customers products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  pricing policy changes by us and by our competitors and suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  seasonality in demand for our products  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in or the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  the loss or gain of important customers  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  terrorism and international conflicts or other crises  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  changes in governmental regulations that could affect our products  or a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for their products 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  or if we fail to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations  we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
product supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the addition of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
we cannot predict whether we will achieve timely  cost effective access to that capacity when needed  or when there will be a capacity shortage again in the future 
as a result of these factors  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by the investment community could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate 
because the markets that our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these seasonal sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted more than one year 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm our sales and revenues if demand drops  or our gross margins if average selling prices decline 
our success for the foreseeable future will be dependent on growth in demand for integrated circuits for a limited number of applications 
in recent years  we have derived a substantial majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and digital camera applications 
we expect that sales of our products for these applications will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will also depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new products in the digital television  hdtv and digital imaging markets 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenues and earnings may suffer 
in the consumer electronic market  our performance has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for dvd players  dvd recorders  digital cameras  broadband digital television and hdtv 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and numbers of features on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
in the digital office market  our performance has been dependant on our ability to successfully develop embedded image processing system on a chip  or soc  solutions for the digital office market  in particular  embedded digital color copier technology and image processing chips for a variety of imaging peripherals  including printers and multi function peripherals  or mfps 
among other technological changes  embedded pdf and color capability are rapidly emerging as market requirements for printers and other imaging devices 
some of our competitors have the capacity to supply these solutions  and some of their solutions have been well received in the marketplace 
we face the challenge of developing new imaging products with the capability to handle greater color and image complexity  including web based documents  and work with higher performing devices in networked environments 
if we are unable to meet these challenges with the development of products that can effectively compete in the oem software and solutions market  our future operating results could suffer 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
the consumer electronics market  in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or the products of our customers could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share or be required to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in those new markets 
for example  our success will depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the recordable dvd player market and products for the broadband digital television and hdtv markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we currently anticipate due to factors outside our control  such as delays in implementation of fcc requiring all new televisions to include a digital receiver 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if this content is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our products  and our sales would suffer 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits and other hardware products  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time  there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
therefore  tsmc and our other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  lack of control over delivery schedules  lack of control over quality assurance  lack of control over manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on a limited number of independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require them to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time  we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered  and may in the future need to consider  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photo masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers and harm our business 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
we face intense competition in the markets in which we compete 
we expect that the level of competition will increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
competition in zoran s core compression technology market has historically been dominated by large companies  such as st microelectronics  and companies that develop and use their own integrated circuits  such as sony and matsushita 
as this market continues to develop  we face competition from other large semiconductor vendors 
the dvd market continues to expand  and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for dvd players and software 
some of these potential competitors may develop captive implementations for use only with their own pc and consumer electronics products 
it is also possible that application software vendors  such as microsoft  may attempt to enter the dvd application market in the future 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
we face competition from several large semiconductor companies in the broadband digital television and set top box markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase in these markets as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter these markets 
we also face significant competition in the digital office market 
the future growth of the digital office market is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work 
while the trend toward outsourcing on the part of our oem customers in this market has accelerated in recent years  any reversal of this trend  or a change in the way they outsource  could seriously harm our business 
many of our existing competitors  as well as oem customers that are expected to compete with us in the future  have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
in addition  much of our future success is dependent on the success of our oem customers 
if we or our oem customers are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results will suffer 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods  while many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these problems  and we expect to continue to experience them in the future  although we cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
our largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of our revenues 
in  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues  and sales to our four largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
in  one customer accounted for of our total revenues while sales to our four largest customers accounted for of our total revenues 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers  or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
customers generally purchase our products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to place orders  whether existing orders will be canceled  or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets in the digital television business 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may in turn harm our business 
fcc regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which these companies conduct their business may impede sales of our products 
in addition  our digital television business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on our suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
for example  any delays by the fcc in imposing its pending requirement that all new televisions have a digital receiver could have an adverse effect on our hdtv business 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  only of our total revenues were derived from north america sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and health risks in a particular region 
a material amount of our research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of our sales and marketing personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
this growth may decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
we also maintain offices in taipei  taiwan  hong kong and seoul  korea  and our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
the significant concentration of our manufacturing activities with third party foundries in taiwan exposes us to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and china 
we have several significant oem customers in japan  korea and other parts of asia 
adverse economic circumstances in japan and elsewhere in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with us in the future or their success in developing and launching devices containing our products 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or armed conflict 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of possible terrorist attacks on the united states and other regions of the world including locations where we maintain operations and by armed conflict in the middle east and related economic instability 
our operations could be harmed due to disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  reduced demand for consumer electronic products due to a potential economic slowdown  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  or potential expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  our products may be less competitive in that country and our revenues may be adversely affected 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
the protection offered by patents is subject to numerous uncertainties 
for example  our competitors may be able to effectively design around our patents  or the patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  while we hold  or have applied for  patents relating to the design of our products  some of our products are based in part on standards  for which we do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
we have generally limited access to and distribution of the source and object code of our software and other proprietary information 
with respect to its page description language software and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for its hdtv products  oak has granted licenses that give its customers access to and restricted use of the source code of oak s software 
this access increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of our technology 
claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  zoran and oak have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights  and both oak and zoran have been parties to a number of patent related lawsuits  both as plaintiff and defendant 
we could become subject to additional litigation in the future  either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement 
future litigation against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  are time consuming and expensive to resolve and require significant management time and attention 
future intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  we may not be able in any or every instance to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we have a more limited patent portfolio than many of our competitors 
if a successful claim is made against us or any of our customers and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we are required to pay substantial damages or awards  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
certain technology used in our products is licensed from third parties  and in connection with these licenses  we are required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and  in some cases  pay royalties 
some of our products require various types of copy protection software that we must license from third parties 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain our right to use the necessary copy protection software  we would be unable to sell and market these products 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating losses  or nols  against taxable income in future periods 
our nols totaled approximately million for federal and million for state tax reporting purposes as of december  as a result of the change of control resulting from our initial public offering in  the amount of nols that we can use to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes is limited to approximately million per year for nols incurred prior to the initial public offering 
the internal revenue code contains a number of provisions that could limit the use of nols against income of the combined company as a result of the merger or as a result of the combination of these transactions 
our utilization of oak s nols may be further limited due to prior oak transactions 
no opinion or irs ruling has been sought regarding the potential application of any of these provisions 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize these nols 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize these respective nols could harm our financial condition 
any additional acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of other complementary companies  products and technologies  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute its current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  or incur other large write offs immediately or in the future 
our operation of any other acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of the business  products or technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
in addition  we have made minority equity investments in early stage companies  and we expect to continue to review opportunities to make additional investments in such companies where we believe such investments will provide us with opportunities to gain access to important technologies or otherwise enhance important commercial relationships 
we have little or no influence over the early stage companies in which we have made or may make strategic  minority equity investments 
each of these investments involves a high degree of risk 
we may not be successful in achieving the technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised  and failure by the early stage company to achieve its own business objectives could result in a loss of all or part of our invested capital and require us to write off all or a portion of such investment 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market acceptance of such products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
if we do not maintain current development contracts or are unable to enter into new development contracts  our business could be harmed 
we historically have generated a portion of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
under these contracts  we receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
if we fail to achieve the milestones specified in our existing development contracts  if our existing contracts are terminated or if we are unable to secure future development contracts  our ability to cost effectively develop new products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we will not be able to expand our business as planned 
we may require substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund our ongoing research and development activities beyond our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including acceptance of and demand for our products  the types of arrangements that we may enter into with our independent foundries  the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects  and any additional acquisitions that we may make 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including a material portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  located in the united states  israel and china 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
the israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the united states dollar 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to the israeli shekel will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against the new israeli shekel 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in israel 
the government programs in which we participate and tax benefits we receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
historically  we have financed a portion of our research and development activities with grants for research and development from the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
we earned proceeds from such grants in although we did not earn proceeds from such grants in  we plan to seek additional grants from the chief scientist in the future 
to be eligible for these grants  our development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if our development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  we will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase our research and development costs 
we also receive tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions as a result of the approved enterprise status of our existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must maintain our approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in our israeli subsidiary 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future  which would harm our business 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of zoran 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include provisions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  annual and quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by zoran or its competitors  loss of key personnel  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item b unresolved staff comments we have not received any written comments from the staff of the securities and exchange commission regarding any of our periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act which remain unresolved 
item properties our executive offices and principal marketing  sales and product development operations are located in approximately  square feet of leased space in sunnyvale  california  under a lease that expires in november we are currently in the process of identifying and negotiating a lease on a new space as well as considering options to negotiate an extension for our current space 
a significant portion of our research and development and engineering facilities and our administration  marketing and sales operations are currently located in approximately  square feet of leased space in an industrial park in haifa  israel under a lease expiring in august we have entered into an agreement for the lease of a new facility in haifa  with a year term and expect to move into the new facility during we also lease facilities  primarily for sales  product development  and technical support  in woburn  massachusetts  manchester  england  dortmund  germany  tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  taipei  taiwan and shenzhen  shanghai and hong kong  china 
except as noted above  we believe that our current facilities are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and that  should it be needed  suitable additional space in each of the locations in which we operate will be available to accommodate expansion of our operations on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings zoran and its subsidiary  oak technology  inc  have been involved in five separate legal actions against mediatek  inc and customers of mediatek based on claims of patent infringement 
on march   zoran and oak filed a complaint with the united states international trade commission itc alleging that certain mediatek dvd player and optical disk controller chips and chipsets  and products in which they are used  infringe zoran s and oak s patents 
in addition to mediatek  the complaint named a number of other proposed respondents that sell products  including dvd players and pc optical storage devices that use mediatek s chips and chipsets 
on september   the itc issued its final ruling finding one of zoran s patents to be valid and infringed by optical disk controller chips and chipsets sold by mediatek and by products using the infringing chips and chipsets sold by a number of mediatek customers 
the itc also issued an exclusion order prohibiting mediatek and specified mediatek customers from importing into the united states any optical disk controller chip or chipset that infringes the zoran patent  or any optical disk storage product containing such a chip or chipset and cease and desist orders to the affected companies located in the united states prohibiting them from importing or selling infringing products in the united states 
in november  both parties filed notices of appeal with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on january   the court issued an order temporarily staying enforcement of the itc s orders 
on march   zoran and oak filed a complaint against mediatek and one of its customers in the united states district court  central district of california alleging similar facts regarding infringement by mediatek s chips and chipsets and products in which they are used 
the lawsuit sought both monetary damages and an injunction to stop the importation and sale of infringing products 
the complaint was subsequently amended to name additional mediatek customers as defendants 
trial of this case was set to begin may  on july   mediatek filed a complaint with the itc alleging that certain zoran and oak dvd player and optical disk controller chips and chipsets infringe two mediatek patents 
the complaint requested that the itc institute an investigation into the accused products and issue exclusion and cease and desist orders prohibiting importation into the united states of allegedly infringing chips and products that contain them 
on september   the itc administrative law judge issued his initial determination finding that none of zoran s optical disk controller chips infringe any claim of the two patents asserted against zoran  that one of the two patents is invalid  that oak s devices do not infringe one of the two patents asserted against oak and that the other patent is invalid  and that mediatek has failed to establish that it has a domestic industry in the united states related to the patents at issue a basic requirement for obtaining relief from the itc 
the initial determination was subject to review by the full itc 
the target date for completion of the investigation was march  on july   mediatek filed a complaint against zoran and oak in the united states district court  district of delaware alleging infringement of the same two patents asserted in mediatek s itc complaint and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
this action was stayed by order of the court on october  on february   mediatek filed a complaint against zoran and zoran digital technologies shenzhen ltd 
zoran s local chinese operations in the shenzhen people s republic of china court alleging infringement of the chinese counterpart patent of one of the two patents asserted in mediatek s itc complaint and seeking monetary damages 
because zoran had not been served with the complaint  the initiation of the proceeding has been stayed 
on january   zoran and oak entered into an agreement with mediatek to settle the litigation 
under the agreement  each party agreed to dismiss its respective claims and counterclaims under all of the pending lawsuits 
the parties also agreed to dismiss all proceedings pending against each other before the itc  including all appeals and enforcement proceedings pending before the itc  united states customs and border protection and the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit related to the itc s september  order excluding the importation into the united states of certain mediatek chips and products incorporating those chips 
in connection with the settlement  zoran  oak and mediatek entered into agreements granting each other non exclusive licenses under the patents that were the subject of the litigation  and additional patents used in the design and manufacture of optical storage devices for personal computer products 
in consideration for licenses granted by zoran  mediatek agreed to make a cash payment of million to zoran  million of which was paid in february and million of which is payable in april in addition  mediatek will be required to make royalty payments of up to million over the month period commencing on the date of the agreement based on future sales of covered mediatek products 
net of amounts payable by zoran to a holder of rights under the oak patents involved in the litigation  and amounts payable as legal fees  zoran will realize approximately million of the cash payment and up to approximately million of the future royalty payments

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our products consist of integrated circuits and related products used in digital versatile disc players  or dvds  movie and home theater systems  digital cameras and video editing systems 
we also provide integrated circuits  software and platforms for digital television applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content through a set top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print  scan  process and transmit documents to computer peripherals that perform printing functions 
subsequent to our acquisition of emblaze semiconductor ltd 
on july   we also provide high performance  low power application processors  technology and products for the multimedia mobile telephone market 
through the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc on june   zoran obtained oren s demodulator ic technology for the global high definition television market 
we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to resellers and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
our cost of hardware product revenues consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of hardware product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
our hardware product gross margin is also dependent on product mix and on the proportion of products sold directly to our oem customers versus indirectly through our marketing partners 
these marketing partners purchase our products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses  maintain inventories and provide customer support and training 
as a result  lower gross margins on sales to these resellers are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing further fluctuations in margins 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
annual licensing revenue can be significantly affected by the timing of a small number of licensing transactions  each accounting for substantial revenues 
accordingly  licensing revenues have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on an annual basis 
in addition  we have historically generated a portion of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers  although development revenue has declined substantially as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software license agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis 
we determine the fair value of our maintenance obligations with reference to substantive renewal rates within the agreement or objective evidence of fair value as required under sop maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we also receive royalty revenues based on per unit shipments of products embedding our software which we recognize upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  typically one quarter in arrears 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and require us to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
from time to time  we enter into non refundable joint development projects in which our customers reimburse us for a portion of our development costs 
we classify such reimbursement of development costs as an offset to research and development expenses as we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development arrangements 
during  we received approximately million in such reimbursements 
we did not receive any reimbursements in or we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
we conduct a material amount of our research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in our foreign subsidiary offices 
as a result  some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currency 
to date  substantially all of our hardware product revenues and our software and other revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of hardware product revenues have been incurred in us dollars 
we expect that most of our revenues and costs of revenue will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
we have not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such fluctuations 
we may in the future elect to take action to reduce our foreign exchange risk 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce taxable income for us federal income tax purposes and by our israel based subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in acquisitions oren semiconductor  inc on june   we completed our acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc oren  a privately held provider of demodulator ics for the global high definition television market 
prior to this acquisition  we had made investments in oren that represented a ownership interest 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired the remaining of oren s outstanding stock by means of a merger of oren with a wholly owned subsidiary of zoran  in consideration for which we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued  shares of zoran common stock valued at million  for total consideration of million  to the other stockholders of oren and to employees holding oren options 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of oren have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include oren s operations between june  and december   and such operations are not reflected in our results of operations for the years ended december  and emblaze semiconductor ltd 
on july   we completed our acquisition of emblaze semiconductor ltd 
emblaze  a wholly owned subsidiary of emblaze ltd 
for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of emblaze have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include emblaze s operations for the full year while the results of operations for the year ended december  only reflect emblaze s operations between july  and december   and such operations are not reflected in our results of operations for the year ended december oak technology  inc on august   we completed our acquisition of oak through the merger of oak with a wholly owned subsidiary of zoran 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of oak have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december  and includes oak s operations for the full period  while our results of operations for the year ended december  only reflect oak s results of operations between august  and december  segments prior to july  we had four reportable segments digital versatile disc dvd  imaging  digital camera dc and digital television dtv 
subsequent to the emblaze acquisition in july  the operations of emblaze were combined with the digital camera group and the group was renamed the mobile segment 
each segment s primary products are based on highly integrated application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and system on a chip  or soc  solutions 
the dvd  imaging and dtv segments also license certain software and other intellectual property 
the dvd group provides products for use in dvd players and recordable dvd players 
the imaging group provides products used in digital copiers  laser and inkjet printers as well as multifunction peripherals 
the mobile group focuses on solutions for multimedia mobile phone products and digital camera products 
the dtv group provides products for standard and high definition digital television products including televisions  set top boxes and personal video recorders 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we generally recognize product sales to distributors at the time of delivery 
however  in some cases we grant rights of return or provide price protection arrangements 
when we are able to estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we establish a reserve for the estimated adjustment and recognize the balance of the product revenue associated with that arrangement upon shipment 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we defer all revenue subject to the arrangement until the return right has lapsed or the price has become fixed 
revenue from development contracts is generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
costs associated with development revenues are included primarily in research and development expenses 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
inventory write downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the delays or inability of certain customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on both specific identification of facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we hold minority interests in private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
at december   these investments totaled million 
the investments are in start up companies engaged in development and are expected to incur losses 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value 
we assess the value of this investment principally by using information acquired from the investee  including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or unexpected operating losses of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to both goodwill and long lived assets  factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in the event actual results differ from these expectations  then the resulting impact to income would be assessed in the period such determination was made 
if it becomes likely that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
this determination includes a process for providing estimates for future taxable income  and requires the use of significant judgment 
any future release or adjustment to the valuation allowance is only made based upon a change in circumstances that triggers a change in judgment  about the realizability  with reasonable assurance  of the related deferred tax asset in future years 
with respect to mergers and acquisitions  we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development expense 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this analysis includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we have historically engaged an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this analysis

total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in total revenues resulted primarily from increases in mobile segment revenues of million  or and dtv segment revenues of million  or  due to increased unit sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in dvd segment revenues resulting from decreases in dvd product sales and by decreases in software and other revenues 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in hardware product revenues was due to revenue increases of million in the mobile segment  million in the dtv segment and million in the imaging segment resulting from increases in unit shipments in each of these segments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the dvd segment hardware product revenues due to reduced unit shipments 
software and other revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in software and other revenues primarily resulted from decreases of million in the dvd segment  million in the imaging segment and million in the mobile segment  partially offset by an increase of million in the dtv segment 
the decreases in revenues from the dvd  imaging and mobile segments were primarily due to reductions in ip licensing revenue 
the increase in dtv segment revenues resulted from an increase in ip licensing agreements 
cost of hardware product revenues 
cost of hardware product revenues was million in compared to million in this decrease in the cost of hardware product revenues was mainly due to lower unit costs primarily due to changes in product mix 
in addition  part of the unit cost reduction was due to charges recorded in for inventory write downs of million coupled with the reduction in our inventory allowances of million in as a result of the sale or disposal of inventory that had been fully written down in most of the inventory write downs in  as well as the sale of previously written down inventory in  primarily related to our dvd vaddis product and a companion chip 
the revenue recorded in associated with the sale of these previously written down products was approximately million 
partially offsetting these reductions in unit costs was an increase associated with increased unit shipments  primarily in the mobile segment 
as a percentage of product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues was primarily due to a change in product mix to a lower percentage of dvd segment products which generally have higher product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues than products in the other segments 
the inventory write down charges in coupled with the reduction in inventory allowances also contributed to the reduction in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc in june and inclusion of emblaze operations acquired in july for the full year in actual r d expenses in were offset in part by million of research grants received from the chief scientist in israel 
we did not receive any such grants in these grants are provided by the israeli government to fund specific r d projects 
we are not obligated to repay the grants  however  future royalties may be owed to the government if the r d activities result in commercial product sales 
we remain committed to investing in research and development to enhance our technology and development capabilities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increase in legal fees by million related to our patent litigation with mediatek  inc  continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by million to cover slow paying accounts and potential risk with increasing business in certain regions of the world and the inclusion of the oren and emblaze operations in amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of amortization of approximately million of intangible assets acquired in the emblaze acquisition in july for the full year in and amortization of million of intangible assets acquired in the oren acquisition in june at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the oak  emblaze and oren acquisitions which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis for various periods extending through deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation was recorded primarily as a result of stock options granted in connection with the oak acquisition 
for the year ended december   these charges were million compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease for fiscal was due to the cancellation of options held by employees who terminated their employment during the year and the lower amortization associated with the graded vesting under the fin model 
restructuring expense 
there were no charges recorded for restructuring expenses during during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of  due to the discontinuation of the sensor product line of the mobile group 
this charge included  related to the reduction in force of employees for severance and other termination expenses   for lease losses on abandoned office space and other miscellaneous legal and consulting fees of approximately  the remaining accrual balance at december  of  relating to facilities will be paid over the lease term through june in process research and development 
in  approximately million of the purchase price of oren semiconductor  inc was allocated to in process research and development for projects which had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition 
at december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired in process research and development 
there were no charges recorded for in process research and development during operating loss 
the operating loss of million in was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets of million  in process research and development expense of million and deferred stock compensation expense of million 
excluding these charges  the company would have recorded operating income of million for fiscal for fiscal  the operating loss of million was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets of million and deferred stock compensation expense of million 
excluding these charges  the company would have recorded operating income of million for fiscal interest income 
interest income increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of the higher interest rates during provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and write off of acquired in process research and development our estimated effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to the recorded in based on net income excluding the amortization of intangible assets and the one time write down of inventory of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in total revenues resulted primarily from an increase in dvd segment revenues of million  or  and imaging segment revenues of million  or 
dtv and mobile segment revenues also grew in by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the increase in dvd segment revenues was due to an increase in hardware product revenues of million due to increased unit sales of dvd products  partially offset by a decrease in software and other revenues of million 
the increase in revenues for both the imaging and dtv segments were primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from the former oak operations for the entire year in  compared to approximately four and one half months for  subsequent to the oak acquisition in august the increase in mobile segment revenues was due to an increase in software and other revenues of million and increases in hardware product revenues of million 
the increase in mobile segment software and other revenues was primarily due to the emblaze semiconductor acquisition in july the increase in mobile segment hardware product revenues was due to increased sales of mobile products 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in hardware product revenues resulted from increases in the dvd segment of million  imaging segment of million  dtv segment of million and the mobile segment of million 
both the dvd and mobile segments hardware product revenue increases were due to increased unit shipments

cost of hardware product revenues 
cost of hardware product revenues was million in compared to million in the increased costs were primarily due to increased unit shipments 
as a percent of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared with for the increase was primarily due to charges of million for inventory write downs of which million was attributable to excess inventory of dvd products   was attributable to products from our discontinued cmos image sensor product line and  related to other products 
research and development 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was driven primarily by the merger with oak as well as the acquisition of emblaze during july actual r d expenses were offset in part by million of research grants received from the chief scientist in israel 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in representing a increase 
this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of the oak and emblaze operations  increased legal fees related to our pending patent litigation with mediatek  inc  costs of compliance with provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was due to the addition of approximately million of amortizable intangible assets acquired in the oak acquisition in august  and million of amortizable intangible assets acquired in the emblaze acquisition in july deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation was recorded primarily as a result of stock options granted in connection with the oak acquisition 
for the year ended december   these charges were million compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease for was due to the cancellation of options held by employees who terminated their employment during the year and the lower amortization associated with the graded vesting under the fin model 
restructuring expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of  due to the discontinuation of the sensor product line of the mobile group 
these charges included  related to the reduction in force of employees for severance and other termination expenses   for lease losses on abandoned office space and other miscellaneous legal and consulting fees of approximately  there were no payments made prior to december  related to these charges 
in process research and development 
there were no charges recorded for in process research and development during in  approximately million of the purchase price of oak was allocated to in process research and development for five r d projects in various product divisions which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition 
revenues for the incremental core technologies developed commenced  and are expected to extend through revenue projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions 
at december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired in process research and development 
operating loss 
the significant operating loss of million in was primarily driven by the amortization of intangible assets of million  deferred stock compensation expense of million  and the million charge taken in the fourth quarter for inventory write downs of which  was attributable to products from the discontinued cmos image sensor product line and million attributable to excess inventory primarily related to dvd products 
absent these charges  the company would have recorded operating income of million for fiscal for fiscal  the operating loss of million was primarily the result of a million charge for in process research and development expense  amortization of intangible assets of million  deferred stock compensation of million and other non recurring acquisition related expenses of million see sg a discussion 
excluding these items  our operating income would have been million for fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased by million to million in compared to million in the reduction was a result of the lower average cash balances during due to the use of cash in the oak acquisition in august and in the emblaze acquisition in july provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and the one time write down of inventory of million  our estimated effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to the recorded in based on net income excluding the amortization of intangible assets and write off of acquired in process research and development 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
at december   we had million of working capital 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to non cash items such as amortization of intangibles assets of million  depreciation  amortization and other of million  in process research and development expense of million  and stock based compensation of million which offset our net loss of million 
cash provided by operations also increased due to decreases of million in net inventory primarily associated with our dvd segment due to reduction in supply chain inventory  million in prepaid expenses and other assets and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  goodwill and other long term liabilities totaling million which were partially offset by a million increase in net accounts receivable due to higher revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the use of million in the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc  partially offset by million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
in addition we spent million for property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and consisted of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchase programs 
our operating activities used cash of million during  primarily due to an increase in net inventory of million which was partially offset by million of net income before non cash related expenses including amortization of intangibles  deferred stock compensation and depreciation 
the cash used in operations was also impacted by the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million which was offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities totaling million as well as the reduction of net accounts receivable by million 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments totaling million offset by the use of million in the emblaze acquisition 
in addition we spent million for property and equipment which was offset by proceeds of approximately  from the sale of a building in taiwan 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and consisted of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchase programs 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter operating leases and license commitments purchase commitments total we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next months 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to the israeli shekel will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the new israeli shekel would have an immaterial affect on our financial condition
