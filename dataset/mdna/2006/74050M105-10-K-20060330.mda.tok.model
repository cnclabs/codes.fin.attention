management s discussion and analysis december  subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
their findings and recommendations were reported to premier s audit committee as well as the audit committees of the subsidiaries 
in  premier reduced its reliance on third party internal audit and loan review providers and expanded its internal audit staff at the holding company level

also  on a regular periodic basis  the subsidiary banks are examined by federal and state banking authorities for safety and soundness as well as compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations 
the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

management s discussion and analysis december  allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill as required by applicable accounting guidance  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis 
realization of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets for the company primarily relate to the allowance for loan losses and net operating loss carryforwards 
in considering the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized  management considers the amount of previously paid taxes that may be recoverable and the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize expected future tax deductions 
at december  management s consideration of the need for a valuation allowance focused on the generation of future taxable income as all available previously paid taxes were recovered from the operating loss reported in in determining the likelihood of generating future taxable income management considered unusual events that have impacted the company s historical earnings and whether these events will recur  the company s operating budget and likely operating results in the near term 
changes in these assumptions could impact the carrying value of deferred tax assets and require a charge to tax expense

management s discussion and analysis december  significant event arising in on june   premier announced that as a result of an ongoing internal investigation it had uncovered a systematic disregard for its loan approval and credit administration policies at its wholly owned subsidiary farmers deposit bank and had accepted the resignation of the bank s president 
on june   senior management of premier received from the bank s former president a request to charge off over million in loans 
concerned about the magnitude of the request and the impact on premier s financial results  premier management promptly notified the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic about the request 
premier s initial investigation indicated that the former president of farmers deposit had engaged in conduct which subverted the bank s internal controls and credit administration policies  conduct which appears to have been designed to avoid detection by management and those entities employed by premier to perform independent reviews of its subsidiaries accounting records  internal controls  and credit risk 
as a result of the investigation into the conduct of the former president of farmers deposit by premier and the fdic  premier charged off over million of loans 
the resulting depletion of the allowance for loan losses together with the analysis of additional risk in the loan portfolio warranted significant additional provisions for loan losses at the bank 
in addition to the provision for loan losses  interest income reversals and other non interest expenses  including bad check write offs and loan review expenses  were recorded 
premier s management  with the assistance of outside independent professionals  conducted a further review of those loans for which significant charge offs or additional provisions were required in the purpose of the review was to determine if the facts or circumstances that gave rise to the additional charge offs or provisions had been improperly withheld from senior management or improperly considered in applying management s estimates and judgments as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior financial statement periods 
the review did identify instances in which collateral securing loans had been released without proper support or notation in loan files  instances in which obligors on notes had been released from their repayment obligation without proper support or notation in loan files and instances in which delinquent loan reporting systems had been manipulated to prevent problem loans from being identified on a timely basis 
premier s senior management determined that if these circumstances had been considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in prior periods then some of the loan charge offs and additional provisions for loan losses recorded in should have been reflected in prior periods 
therefore  in  the financial statements for and were restated to reflect the financial statement effect of the matters that occurred in those periods but which were improperly concealed by subsidiary management

management s discussion and analysis december  on december   premier announced that farmers deposit bank had reached an agreement with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the kentucky department of financial institutions kdfi 
collectively referred to as supervisory authorities 
to consent to the issuance of a cease desist order order from its supervisory authorities 
the order also outlined a number of steps to be taken by farmers deposit which were designed to remedy and or prevent the reoccurrence of events that gave rise to the investigation during the latter half of the full text of the order is available on the fdic website at www 
fdic 
gov or by calling the fdic public information center at having found that farmers deposit had fully complied with the order  the supervisory authorities rescinded the order on december  the securities and exchange commission sec investigated the information disclosed in premier s june and july  forms k and the june  and september  forms q regarding farmers deposit and requested information about premier s internal investigation 
premier fully cooperated with the sec 
at the conclusion of its investigation  the sec issued an administrative cease desist order regarding premier s financial reporting and internal controls concerning premier s quarterly through and annual and public filings 
according to the sec order  both the remedial acts promptly undertaken by premier and premier s cooperation with the sec staff were taken into consideration in reaching the settlement 
summary financial results premier had net income from continuing operations of million in compared to a million of net income from continuing operations reported for the year net income increased in as a result of an increase in interest income due to higher yields on earning assets  a decrease in interest expense due to the early retirement of trust preferred securities  a significant decrease in the provision for loan losses  and a reduction in the net operating costs of the company 
net income in was primarily the result of the continued earnings of premier s profitable banks partially offset by expenses associated with rehabilitating its subsidiary  farmers deposit bank  conducting premier s own investigation  cooperating with the sec investigation  and reducing debt at the holding company 
the income in follows a million loss in primarily due to large provisions for loan losses and bad check losses at farmers deposit bank

management s discussion and analysis december  reached its highest level in five years in at 
the net losses in and were primarily the result of an increase in the provision for loan losses  resulting in negative net credit income for those years 
in  net credit income was once again positive and in in  minimal provisions for loan losses were recorded and thus there was little reduction from net interest income 
this increase in net credit income as a percent of average earning assets was complemented by the highest level of non interest income as a percent of average earning assets over the past five years and a reduction in non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets when compared to the previous year 
as illustrated in the table  premier s fully taxable net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was up to from the recorded in as the yield on loans and investments increased in while interest expense savings were realized due to the early extinguishment of a portion of premier s junior subordinated debentures and other borrowed funds late in analysis of return on assets and equity from continuing operations as a percent of average earning assets fully taxable equivalent net interest income provision for loan losses net credit income gains on the sales of assets subsidiaries non interest income non interest expense tax equivalent adjustment applicable income taxes return on average earning assets multiplied by average earning assets to average total assets return on average assets multiplied by average assets to average equity x x x x x return on average equity the net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income as a percent of average earning assets decreased in to compared to in and in  the lowest ratio reported in the five years presented in the table 
the decrease in net overhead was the result of increases in premier s non interest income related to service charges on deposit accounts and secondary market mortgage commissions plus a significant decrease in professional fee expense 
the increase in net overhead was the result of increases in non interest expense related to the investigation of farmers deposit bank  the loss on the sale of facilities formerly leased to citizens bank which was sold in  and accelerated amortization costs related to the early redemption of premier s trust preferred securities

management s discussion and analysis december  sale of subsidiaries in premier suspended its acquisition strategy in order to focus on improving its subsidiary bank operations by strengthening its management oversight 
as part of this change in strategy  premier elected to dispose of two of its subsidiary banks in on january   the company disposed of all the deposits approximately million  the majority of loans approximately million and the premises and equipment approximately million of the bank of mt 
vernon under the terms of a purchase and assumption agreement 
as a result of this transaction  the banking charter of the bank of mt 
vernon was relinquished and premier agreed not to compete in the markets previously served by the bank of mt 
vernon 
also  on december   the company disposed of certain assets and liabilities of the sabina bank 
the sale included all the loans approximately million and all the deposits approximately million  as well as the premises and equipment approximately million 
certain assets of the bank were retained by premier pending liquidation of the bank  which occurred in the operating results of both the bank of mount vernon and the sabina bank were included in premier s operating results through the respective dates of the sale 
however  the operating results subsequent to do not include any of the operations of these two banks 
comparisons of average balances and income statement categories to are all affected by the disposition of these two subsidiaries 
in the fourth quarter of  premier adopted and began to implement a plan to sell its subsidiary citizens bank kentucky  inc citizens bank located in georgetown  kentucky 
on february   the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell citizens bank in a cash transaction valued at approximately  which was completed on july  the sale of this subsidiary helped to restore the financial position of premier after the impact of the losses sustained at farmers deposit bank during the second and third quarters of as a result of the sale  regulatory capital ratios of premier were restored to the stronger levels management wishes to maintain  cash reserves of the holding company were replenished  a portion of the cash reserves were used to reduce outstanding debt by million  and the profit from the sale allowed premier to utilize a substantial portion of its federal income tax net operating loss carryforward

management s discussion and analysis december  in  average earning assets declined by or million from  following a or million decline in from average interest bearing liabilities  the primary source of funds supporting the earning assets  decreased or million in from  which follows a or million decline in from the decline in average earning assets was primarily the result of a decline in federal funds sold as those funds were either used to fund loans or to continue the company s debt reduction strategy 
the decline in average interest bearing liabilities was due to a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits and a million decrease in average high cost debt and fhlb advances 
nearly half of the decrease in average interest bearing deposit was offset by a million increase in non interest bearing deposits 
the decline in average earning assets was the result of the residual effect of the million of loan charge offs in  the million of loan charge offs in primarily at farmers deposit in both years  coupled with loan maturities and principal pay downs that were not renewed and the redeployment of other available funds to reduce debt 
the decline in interest bearing liabilities was largely due to debt reduction strategies  a continued shift in customer deposits from interest bearing to non interest bearing  and the non renewal of certain certificates of deposit at farmers deposit bank in conjunction with premier s capital restoration plan for that bank 
additional information on each of the components of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is contained in the following sections of this report 
loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during after several declining years  average loans increased in by million or 
the marginal increase is largely attributable to the high level of charge offs and loan collections at farmers deposit which nearly offset the increase in loans in premier s other markets 
the average loans outstanding at farmers deposit declined by million in of the remaining increase  premier realized an million or increase in loans in its west virginia markets  a million or increase in loans in its ohio markets  and a million or increase in average loans in premier s other kentucky markets 
in  average loans declined by million or 
the decline is again largely attributable to the high level of charge offs and loan collections at farmers deposit 
the average loans outstanding at farmers deposit declined by million in  million more than premier s total decline of million 
of the remaining increase  premier realized a increase in loans in its west virginia markets and an increase in loans in its ohio markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in average loans in premier s other kentucky markets 
due to the low interest rate environment in and  many borrowers sought to refinance their loans to reduce their interest costs 
due to the lackluster economy and the resulting lower demand for loans during much of that time  larger banks began competing more strongly by enticing borrowers with prime rate or below prime rate loans 
therefore  scheduled loan maturities were not necessarily renewed with premier 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  total loans at december  increased by million or from the total at december  this increase follows a million or decrease in from total loans at december  the increase in was the result increased loan demand in premier s markets which offset million of loan charge offs recorded during the year  half at farmers deposit and million of net loan collections at farmers deposit 
the decline in period end loans was the result of the million of loan charge offs recorded during the year  primarily at farmers deposit million 
loans secured by real estate  which in total constituted approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also participates in the solicitation of loans for the secondary market and recognizes the referral fees in non interest income 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy 
additional information on off balance sheet commitments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements

the decrease in was due to charge offs of loans determined to be uncollectible  the sale of million of oreo property  and the collection or rehabilitation of previously delinquent loans 
as management s efforts to collect these loans upon maturity continue  loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
premier is committed to continuing to reduce its high level of non performing assets and implementing strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in and are masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined even further to million 
the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans whereby management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real

if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations

during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 
a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the creditor will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial condition and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired

management s discussion and analysis december  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in a given loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions included greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total year end loans 
this ratio is a decrease from the prior year s and the at the end of the decrease in the allowance in was the result of charge offs of loans previously identified as impaired partially offset by  of recoveries 
the decrease in the allowance in was the result of charge offs of loans previously identified as impaired partially offset by million of recoveries and million of additional provisions for loan losses during in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
the provision for loan losses in was only  during the third and fourth quarters of  negative provisions were recorded substantially offsetting the provisions recorded during the first half of the year 
during the latter half of  premier realized collections of previously impaired loans whereby estimated losses were previously assigned to the loan as well as recoveries of previously charged off loans 
these positive events as well as the ongoing reduction in premier s historical loss ratios resulted in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and  thus  negative provisions were warranted 
future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk 
the provision for loan losses in was million  down significantly from the million provision in the provision in was the result of newly identified impaired loans and increases in the volume of loans outstanding at the banks located in west virginia

while all categories of loan charge offs were down in  consumer loan charge offs continued to exceed the other categories of loan charge offs 
although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the high level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which at december  was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans

management s discussion and analysis december  premier s average investment in federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased by in this follows a decrease in averaging million in  federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased million from the million averaged in  and were lower than the million averaged during the decrease in average federal funds sold in and was the result of investing more of premier s available funds into higher yielding investments and using a portion of the funds to reduce outstanding debt and satisfy deposit withdrawals 
fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in  premier began raising the rates paid on it interest bearing deposits in response to the increase in market interest rates 
however  as premier has been able to reduce a portion of its high rate long term borrowings  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities remained relatively unchanged in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in the decrease is largely due to the early redemption of million of premier s trust preferred securities late in and the payment of quarters of deferred distributions on the trust preferred securities in march the interest savings more than offset the increase in interest expense due to the rise in rates paid on now and money market transactional deposit accounts and on certificates of deposit 
in  premier decreased the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the decline in market interest rates 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in the decrease is largely due to declines in rates paid on time deposits as higher rate certificates of deposits were either not renewed at maturity or were redeposited at lower rates in conjunction with the decline in market interest rates 
similarly  rates paid on now and money market transactional deposit accounts also declined 
due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense

see the additional discussion on liquidity below 
in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the decrease was largely due to a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits at farmers deposit bank 
the remaining increase was the result of internal growth in premier s other markets 
in  interest bearing deposits decreased by or million on average when compared to the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits at farmers deposit bank 
the remaining decrease was the result of the non renewal of certain high rate time deposits in that had a carryover effect on and a decrease in average interest bearing transaction deposits

premier s short term borrowings primarily consist of federal funds purchased from other banks  and securities sold under agreements to repurchase with commercial customers 
these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  up million from the average in due to an increase in public fund repurchase agreements 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  up million again from the average in near the end of  farmers deposit bank reduced its short term borrowings to zero as part of premier s recapitalization plan 
this event had the effect of reducing premier s average short term borrowings in by approximately million 
this decline in short term borrowings was more than offset by the public fund repurchase agreements established at the affiliate banks in as discussed above

management s discussion and analysis december  premier s trust preferred securities represent beneficial interests in the assets of pfbi capital trust nasdaq nms pfbip 
the trust holds million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures due in this total is down from the million outstanding at december  due to million of early redemptions during the fourth quarter of quarterly cash distributions on the preferred securities are made to the extent interest on the debentures is received by the trust 
as previously disclosed  pursuant to an agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on september   as superseded by an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland dated january   premier is required to request approval for the payment of distributions due on the trust preferred securities 
during the quarter ended june   premier was notified by the federal reserve bank of cleveland that due to the deterioration of core earnings of the company  among other issues  the frb would not allow the payment of the distribution due june  on premier s trust preferred securities 
in response  premier reached an agreement with the federal reserve bank of cleveland whereby premier s chairman of the board  who is also its largest shareholder  agreed to loan the company the amount of the distribution   so that premier  with the federal reserve bank s approval  could make the distribution 
the loan is unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank 
a similar agreement was reached for the payment of the distribution due september  premier s president and chief executive officer  who is also a director  agreed to loan the company the amount of the september distribution   this loan is also unsecured at a zero interest rate with no defined maturity date 
the loan also cannot be repaid without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in december  the federal reserve bank of cleveland frb denied premier s request to make the fourth quarter distribution 
accordingly  premier exercised its right to defer the payment of interest on the subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities for an indefinite period which can be no longer than consecutive quarterly periods 
premier continued to defer the payment of interest throughout and in the first quarter of  premier sought and received approval from the frb to make the first quarter distribution and all nine previously deferred quarterly distributions 
during the deferral period  the deferred distributions also accrued interest at an annual rate of 
the payment was disbursed on march  to shareholders of record on march  the accrued interest on the deferred distributions was also paid when the deferred distributions were paid on march  the frb has also approved the payment of current distributions due through march  although the frb has approved the payment of the deferred and current distributions through march   premier is still bound by the written agreement and will be required to request the frb s approval to pay future distributions

management s discussion and analysis december  as part of a debt reduction and profitability plan presented on january  to the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem  of the then outstanding  trust preferred securities 
the goal of the redemption was to use a portion of premier s cash on hand to reduce its total interest cost and thus improve profitability 
the redemption reduced premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
however  this benefit was partially offset due to the interest accrued in on the deferred quarterly distributions 
in  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem million of trust preferred securities on october  and another million on december  these two redemptions reduced premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
in  premier requested and received approval from the federal reserve to redeem million of trust preferred securities on december  it is anticipated that this redemption will reduce premier s interest cost by approximately  per year 
future early redemptions  if any  will also require federal reserve approval  pursuant to a previously disclosed written agreement entered into with the federal reserve bank of cleveland on january  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model prepared by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

this balance along with cash dividends expected to be received from its subsidiaries is sufficient to cover the operating costs of the parent  service its existing other debt and to pay the deferred trust preferred distributions approved by the federal reserve in the first quarter of during  the parent company generated million of cash from operations and used million to redeem a portion of the trust preferred securities outstanding and payoff its outstanding other debt 
during  the parent company received million from the sale of its subsidiary  citizens bank and generated million from operations 
premier used a portion of these proceeds to complete the necessary capital injections into farmers deposit bank to maintain the bank s capital ratios required by the fdic in accordance with the order 
premier used a substantial portion of the proceeds to reduce its borrowed funds and redeem a portion of the trust preferred securities outstanding 
the remainder was held for future use

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  up from in and from during the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the increase in was largely due to increase in net income in and the decline in average assets due to the sale of citizen s bank kentucky on july  the increase in was largely due to the decline in average total assets due to the sale of citizen s bank kentucky 
the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  both of these ratios are above the recommended to recommended by the federal reserve 
the increase in the ratios was the result of the increase in total capital due to the increase in net income and decline in total assets resulting from the sale of citizens bank  coupled with a decrease in disallowed deferred tax assets 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines for all banks and bank holding companies  deferred tax assets are subtracted from premier s available total equity disallowed if they generally cannot be realized through available tax refunds in

in  citizens deposit bank requested and received approval from the federal reserve to pay a million dividend in march this amount was substantially higher than the bank s prior two years of reported net income 
as such  citizens deposit bank must continue to request approval for up to two years to pay any future dividends to the parent company out of its current earnings

management s discussion and analysis december  income statement analysis net interest income net interest income  the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense associated with funding those assets  is premier s most significant component of earnings 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  up from the million earned in which follows a decrease in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the increase in net interest income in is largely due to an increase in interest income from loans and investments due to higher yields and a decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in outstanding debt 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  increases in the yields on loans  investments and other earning assets increased premier s interest income by million 
this increase was complemented by interest expense savings of over million due to the reduction of outstanding debt  fhlb borrowings and other borrowings 
some of this interest expense savings was offset by higher interest paid on deposits and other short term borrowings due to overall higher rates paid on deposits and an increase average certificates of deposit outstanding 
the combined effect was to increase net interest income by  for the year 
the decrease in net interest income in is largely due to a decrease in the volume of loans outstanding coupled with a decline in loan interest income resulting from the high level of non accrual loans at farmers deposit 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  decreases in the volume of earning assets primarily loans in reduced premier s interest income by million 
this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of interest bearing liabilities in resulting in a million decline in interest expense 
the net effect was to reduce net interest income by  for the year 
similarly  the lower interest rate environment in  coupled with the decline in interest income for loans placed on non accrual resulted in reduced interest income of million 
this decline was partially offset by reduced interest expense of million which resulted primarily from the lower interest rate environment and the resulting lower rate paid on deposits 
during the latter half of  interest rates began to rise  which resulted in increases in the interest paid on premier s long and short term borrowings

service charges on deposit accounts increased to  in  an increase of or  this increase follows a or  increase in over the increases are the result of changes in the way premier charges customers for over drawing their checking accounts and a general increase in customers and activity 
insurance commissions increased in by  following a  decline in the increase in is largely due to an increase in new loan generations as loan demand increased in the decline in was largely due to lower new loan generations resulting from lower loan demand and stiffer competition from larger banks 
other income increased or  in largely due to an increase in the commissions from originating secondary market mortgage loans  an increase in debit and atm card transaction fees and an increase in revenue from other traditional banking services such as checkbook sales and safe box rental 
these increases were partially offset by lower data processing revenue from non affiliate banks as premier s data processing subsidiary ceased providing these services in late and early other income decreased or  in from the high amount of other income reported in this is primarily the result of a lower volume of commissions from originating secondary market mortgage loans  lower data processing revenue from non affiliate banks  and a high level of collections of loans retained from the bank of mt

effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
