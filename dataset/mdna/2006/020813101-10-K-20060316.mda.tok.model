in  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill and periodically reviews goodwill for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
goodwill is reviewed periodically for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
the assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the company  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action  the risk associated with those cash flows  and the company s cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis for all inventories 
the determination of market value involves assessment of numerous factors  including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices 
inventories determined to be damaged  obsolete  or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value 
the company also purchases raw materials  and manufactures finished goods  for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval

employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pension  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost and trend rates

reserves are recorded when the company  in consultation with counsel  determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
deferred tax assets are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization  which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards
