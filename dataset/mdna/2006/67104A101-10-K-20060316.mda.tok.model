item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world  with seven restaurant concepts  nearly  system wide restaurants and annual revenues for company owned stores exceeding billion 
we operate in all states and in countries internationally  predominantly through company owned stores  but we also operate under a variety of partnerships and franchises 
our primary focus as a company of restaurants is to provide a quality product together with quality service across all of our brands 
this goal entails offering consumers of different demographic backgrounds an array of dining alternatives suited for differing needs 
our sales are primarily generated through a diverse customer base  which includes people eating in our restaurants as regular users who return for meals several times a week or on special occasions such as birthday parties  private events and for business entertainment 
secondarily  we generate revenues through sales of franchises and ongoing royalties as well as the sale and redemption of gift certificates 
the restaurant industry is a highly competitive and fragmented business  which is subject to sensitivity from changes in the economy  trends in lifestyles  seasonality customer spending patterns at restaurants are generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year and fluctuating costs 
operating margins for restaurants are susceptible to fluctuations in prices of commodities  which include among other things  beef  chicken  seafood  butter  cheese  produce and other necessities to operate a store  such as natural gas or other energy supplies 
additionally  the restaurant industry is characterized by a high initial capital investment  coupled with high labor costs 
the combination of these factors underscores our initiatives to drive increased sales at existing stores in order to raise margins and profits  because the incremental sales contribution to profits from every additional dollar of sales above the minimum costs required to open  staff and operate a store is very high 
we are not a company focused on growth in the number of restaurants just to generate additional sales 
our expansion and operation strategies are to balance investment costs and the economic factors of operation  in order to generate reasonable  sustainable margins and achieve acceptable returns on investment from our restaurant concepts 
promotion of our outback steakhouse and carrabba s italian grill restaurants is assisted by the use of national and spot television and radio media  which we have also begun to use in certain markets for our bonefish grill brand 
we advertise on television in spot markets when our brands achieve sufficient penetration to make a meaningful broadcast schedule affordable 
we rely on word of mouth customer experience  grassroots marketing in local venues  direct mail and national print media to support broadcast media and as the primary campaigns for our upscale casual and newer brands 
we do not attempt to lure customers with discounts  as is common to many restaurants in the casual dining industry 
our advertising spending is targeted to promote and maintain brand image and develop consumer awareness 
we strive to drive sales through excellence in execution rather than through discounting and other short lived marketing efforts 
our marketing strategy of getting people to visit frequently and also recommending our restaurants to others complements what we believe are the fundamental elements of success convenient sites  service oriented employees and flawless execution in a well managed restaurant 
key factors which can be used in evaluating and understanding our restaurants and assessing our business include the following average unit volumes a per store calculated average sales amount  which helps us gauge the changes in consumer traffic  pricing and development of the brand  operating margins store revenues after deduction of the main store level operating costs including cost of sales  restaurant operating expenses  and labor and related costs  system wide sales a total sales volume for all company owned  franchise and unconsolidated joint venture stores  regardless of ownership to interpret the health of our brands  and same store or comparable sales a year over year comparison of sales volumes for stores that are open in both years in order to remove the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing stores 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview continued our financial results included growth of consolidated revenues by to billion  decline in net income by to million  primarily resulting from provisions for impaired assets and restaurant closings of  in compared to  in  and new unit openings across all brands 
sales increases were driven by new unit openings 
our strategy in the past year included expansion of carrabba s italian grill and several of our newer concepts  particularly bonefish grill  fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar and cheeseburger in paradise 
our international outback steakhouse operations continued to grow profits  which was the result of targeted attempts to translate our brand into local consumer preferences  primarily in the asian markets 
south korea has been our largest and most profitable international operation 
in  our results were affected by the growth of our newer brands 
as we continue to develop and expand new restaurant concepts at different rates  our cost of sales  restaurant operating expenses and income from operations change from the mix of brands in our portfolio with slightly different operating characteristics 
labor and related expenses are higher at our new format stores than have typically been experienced at outback steakhouses 
however  cost of sales at those stores is lower than those at outback 
these trends are expected to continue with our planned development of stores in we made progress in on our strategy to improve portfolio returns by increasing the profit contribution at carrabba s italian grill  fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar and bonefish grill compared to the prior year 
it was also a year in which we made the decision to exit the paul lee s chinese kitchen business and slow development of cheeseburger in paradise in order to allow time to improve that concept s operating model during in  after  of provisions for impaired assets and restaurant closings and  of pre opening expenses  carrabba s  fleming s and bonefish comprised approximately  of total income from operations of  our industry s challenges and risks include  but are not limited to  the impact of government regulation  the availability of employees  consumer perceptions regarding food safety and or the health benefits of certain types of food  including attitudes about alcohol consumption  economic conditions and commodity pricing 
additionally  our planned development schedule is subject to risk because of rising real estate and construction costs  and our results are affected by consumer tolerance of price increases 
changes in our operations may also result from changes in beef prices and other commodity costs and continued pre opening expenses from the development of new restaurants and our expansion strategy

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation property  fixtures and equipment property  fixtures and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
at the time property  fixtures and equipment are retired  or otherwise disposed of  the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings 
we expense repair and maintenance costs incurred to maintain the appearance and functionality of the restaurant that do not extend the useful life of any restaurant asset or are less than  improvements to leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term  which includes cancelable renewal periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives buildings and building improvements to years furniture and fixtures to years equipment to years leasehold improvements to years our accounting policies regarding property  fixtures and equipment include certain management judgments and projections regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets and what constitutes increasing the value and useful life of existing assets 
these estimates  judgments and projections may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
operating leases rent expense for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial lease term includes the build out period of our leases  which is typically before rent payments are due under the terms of the lease 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent and is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation of the purchase price of assets acquired 
on an annual basis  we review the recoverability of goodwill based primarily upon an analysis of discounted cash flows of the related reporting unit as compared to the carrying value or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
generally  we perform our annual assessment for impairment during the third quarter of the fiscal year  unless facts and circumstances require differently 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation impairment of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in evaluating long lived restaurant assets for impairment  we consider a number of factors such as a restaurant sales and cash flow trends  b local competition  c changing demographic profiles  d local economic conditions  e new laws and government regulations that adversely affect sales and profits  and f the ability to recruit and train skilled restaurant employees 
if the aforementioned factors indicate that we should review the carrying value of the restaurant s long lived assets  we perform an impairment analysis 
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of other assets and liabilities typically exist for land and buildings and for combined fixtures  equipment and improvements for each restaurant 
if the total future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from value impairment is recognized by a charge to earnings 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  health and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed in the following table workers compensation general liability health property coverage for claims arising from liquor liability  there is an additional  deductible until a  aggregate has been met 
at that time  any claims arising from liquor liability revert to the general liability deductible 
we are self insured for all aggregate health benefits claims  limited to  per covered individual per year 
we record a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company 
our accounting policies regarding insurance reserves include certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation revenue recognition we record revenues for normal recurring sales upon the performance of services 
revenues from the sales of franchises are recognized as income when we have substantially performed all of our material obligations under the franchise agreement 
continuing royalties  which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants  are accrued as income when earned 
these revenues are included in the line other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift certificates that have been sold but not yet redeemed and are recorded at the anticipated redemption value 
when the gift certificates are redeemed  we recognize restaurant sales and reduce the related deferred liability 
employee partner stock buyout expense area operating partners are required to purchase a to interest in the restaurants they develop for an initial investment of  this interest gives the area operating partner the right to receive a percentage of his or her restaurants annual cash flows for the duration of the agreement 
under the terms of these partners employment agreements  we have the option to purchase their interest after a five year period under the conditions of the agreement 
we estimate future purchases of area operating partners interests using current information on restaurant performance to calculate and record an accrued buyout liability in the line item partner deposit and accrued buyout liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
expenses associated with recording the buyout liability are included in the line general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
when partner buyouts occur  they are completed primarily through cash and issuance of our common stock to the partner equivalent to the fair value of their interest 
in the period we complete the buyout  an adjustment is recorded to recognize any remaining expense associated with the purchase and reduce the related accrued buyout liability 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of outback steakhouse  inc and our affiliated partnerships in which we are a general partner and own a controlling financial interest 
we consolidate variable interest entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
we consolidate a limited liability company affiliated with our california franchisees that holds a line of credit that we guarantee 
the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts and operations of our roy s consolidated venture in which we have a less than majority ownership 
we consolidate this venture because we control the executive committee which functions as a board of directors through representation on the board by related parties  and we are able to direct or cause the direction of management and operations on a day to day basis 
additionally  the majority of capital contributions made by our partner in the roy s consolidated venture have been funded by loans to the partner from a third party where we are required to be a guarantor of the debt  which provides us control through our collateral interest in the joint venture partner s membership interest 
as a result of our controlling financial interest in this venture  it is included in our consolidated financial statements 
the portion of income or loss attributable to the minority interests  not to exceed the minority interest s equity in the subsidiary  is eliminated in the line item in our consolidated statements of income entitled elimination of minority interest 
all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires the fair value measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  and recognition of those expenses in the statement of operations 
sfas no 
r is effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year after june  we will continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method until adoption of sfas no 
r on january  historically  the compensation expense recognized related to stock options under this method has been minimal 
as a result  adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r is expected to have a material impact to reported net income and earnings per share  particularly as a result of stock options issued under our managing partner program  described below 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and recognize compensation expense on the unvested portion of previously issued awards over the remaining vesting period 
as part of our managing partner program  the managing partner and chef partner at fleming s and roy s of each domestic restaurant is required  as a condition of employment  to sign a five year employment agreement and is required to purchase an interest in the restaurant he or she is employed to manage 
this interest gives the managing partner and chef partner the right to receive a percentage of their restaurant s monthly cash flows for the duration of the five year agreement 
for managing partners  the purchase price has been  for an interest ranging from to and for chef partners has ranged from a purchase price of  to  for an interest ranging from to 
the specifics of the purchase prices and percentage interests for managing partners and chef partners are detailed in item of this annual report on form k 
upon completion of each five year term of employment  each managing partner and chef partner has historically been issued stock options with the number of options determined by a formula based on a multiple of the cash flows distributed from their interest 
however  all new managing partner and chef partner agreements entered into on and after march   will provide for participation in a new deferred compensation program  which will replace the issuance of stock options upon completion of each term of employment 
managing partners and chef partners will also be given the opportunity to amend their existing agreements to provide for participation in this deferred compensation program in lieu of issuance of stock options during a roll out period in the estimated pre tax impact of adopting sfas no 
r for  relating to prior years unvested stock option grants only  will be approximately  to  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to the legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
adoption of fin is required by the fiscal year ending after december  we adopted fin on december  and our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation recently issued financial accounting standards continued in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
also under sfas no 
 if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb  such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
this guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is applicable only to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  our adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation cautionary statement the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following any statements regarding future sales  costs and expenses and gross profit percentages  any statements regarding the continuation of historical trends  any statements regarding the expected number of future restaurant openings and expected capital expenditures and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  should  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
as noted above  our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements included in the discussion of future operating results and expansion strategy and elsewhere in this report as a result  among other things  of the following i the restaurant industry is a highly competitive industry with many well established competitors  ii our results can be impacted by changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts including consumer tolerance of price increases  local  regional  national and international economic conditions  the seasonality of our business  demographic trends  traffic patterns  change in consumer dietary habits  employee availability  the cost of advertising and media  government actions and policies  inflation  and increases in various costs  including construction and real estate costs  iii our results can be affected by consumer perception of food safety  iv our ability to expand is dependent upon various factors such as the availability of attractive sites for new restaurants  ability to obtain appropriate real estate sites at acceptable prices  ability to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis  impact of government moratoriums or approval processes  which could result in significant delays  ability to obtain all necessary contractors and subcontractors  union activities such as picketing and hand billing that could delay construction  the ability to generate or borrow funds  the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms  and the ability to recruit and train skilled management and restaurant employees  v price and availability of commodities  including but not limited to  such items as beef  chicken  shrimp  pork  seafood  dairy  potatoes  onions and energy supplies are subject to fluctuation and could increase or decrease more than we expect  and or vi weather and acts of god could result in construction delays and also adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time 
impact of inflation in the last three years we have not operated in a period of high general inflation  however  we have experienced material increases in specific commodity costs and utilities 
our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime and tip credits 
significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and or state minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs in the last three years 
to the extent permitted by competition  we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving lines of credit bear interest at to basis points over the   or london interbank offered rate 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the  outstanding balance under these lines at december  was 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our japanese lines of credit bear interest at either to basis points over libor or libor divided by a percentage equal to minus the eurocurrency reserve percentage 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the approximately  outstanding balance at december  was 
notes payable of approximately  to japanese banks bear interest at 
notes payable of approximately  to south korean banks bear interest at rates ranging from to at december our average debt borrowings were approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   our total debt  including consolidated guaranteed debt  was  should interest rates based on our average borrowings of approximately  through december  increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by approximately  over amounts reported for the year ended december our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations relates primarily to our direct investment in restaurants in south korea  hong kong  japan  the philippines and brazil  our outstanding debt to japanese and south korean banks of approximately  and  respectively  at december  and to our royalties from international franchisees 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate changes 
our investments in these countries totaled approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
although we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients  there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and wild fish  and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
other commodities are purchased based upon negotiated price ranges established with vendors with reference to the fluctuating market prices 
the related agreements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors and caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our financial results adversely  although any changes in commodity prices would affect our competitors at about the same time as us 
we expect that in most cases increased commodity prices could be passed through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
however  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or  if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
additionally  from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit menu price flexibility  and in those cases margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
in addition to the market risks identified above and to the risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon five vendors 
we currently purchase approximately of our beef from two beef suppliers 
if these vendors were unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts  we would encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets
