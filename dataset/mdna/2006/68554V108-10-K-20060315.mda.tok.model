the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview our company operates primarily in the worldwide billion in vitro diagnostics business 
we develop  manufacture and market oral fluid specimen collection devices using proprietary oral fluid technologies  diagnostic products including immunoassays  and other in vitro diagnostic tests 
we also manufacture and sell medical devices for the removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic product offerings primarily target the infectious disease and substance abuse testing segments of the larger in vitro diagnostic market  and are used in both laboratories as well as the emerging  and rapidly growing  point of care marketplace 
our orasure and intercept oral fluid collection devices  and their related assays  are processed in a laboratory  while the oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test is designed for use at the point of care 
our cryosurgical products are also used at the point of care 
in vitro diagnostics have traditionally used blood or urine as the bodily fluids upon which tests are conducted 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor  and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests and  when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
we have made significant progress in increasing our sales and gaining market acceptance for our products 
as a result  we reported strong financial results for  our first profitable year 
our total revenues were million  or an increase of over  and our net income for the year was million 
net income includes million associated with a deferred tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter  partially offset by a  current tax provision 
our liquidity also improved  as we reported million in cash flow from operating activities in and we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  sales into the infectious disease testing market segment increased significantly in due to the continued market acceptance of our oraquick test 
this increase resulted largely from sales directly to various public health organizations  sales to abbott laboratories for distribution primarily to hospitals  sales to the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa and centers for disease control and prevention cdc for further distribution in the public health market  and sales into the international marketplace 
during the period march june  we received fda approval of our oraquick advance test to detect antibodies to both hiv and hiv in oral fluid  finger stick whole blood  venous whole blood  and plasma samples 
in june  we also obtained a clia waiver for the oraquick advance hiv test for all specimen types except plasma 
this new product was officially launched commercially in october since that time  the demand for oraquick advance has grown quickly  and in we converted all oraquick customers to this new product and have recently ceased selling our original oraquick hiv test 

table of contents in june  we received a nonexclusive  worldwide sublicense to certain hiv patents held by bio rad laboratories 
we believe that the oraquick advance test  provides a significant competitive advantage by allowing us to sell a versatile rapid hiv test that is capable of detecting antibodies to both the hiv and hiv strains of the virus in oral fluids  finger stick whole blood  venous whole blood and plasma 
in  the cdc and samhsa ordered a total of million of oraquick advance devices and related testing materials 
we expect that these agencies  and perhaps other federal governmental agencies  may make future bulk purchases of oraquick advance for further distribution to the public health and other markets throughout the united states 
failure to receive  or any delays in receiving  additional bulk orders for oraquick advance from these government agencies could adversely affect our financial performance 
in february  we entered into an agreement for the distribution of oraquick advance with abbott laboratories 
under this agreement  abbott was appointed as our exclusive distributor in the us hospital market and as a non exclusive distributor in the us physicians office marketplace 
as our exclusive distributor to hospitals  abbott sells oraquick advance to federal hospitals under the terms and conditions of our federal supply schedule that is filed with the us general services administration 
we have retained exclusive rights to all other markets  including the public health and criminal justice markets  the military  the cdc  samhsa and other government agencies 
we utilize a small internal sales force to support abbott and work together with them to maximize the penetration of oraquick advance in the hospital market 
the markets for rapid hiv testing are very competitive and the level of competition is expected to increase  which could affect sales of our oraquick tests 
for example  the ortho diagnostics division of johnson johnson  bio rad laboratories  abbott and biomerieux  inc each sell competing laboratory based hiv enzyme immunoassays eias  and maximum biomedical formerly calypte  inc sells an hiv screening test for urine  in the united states 
in addition  medmira and trinity biotech have each received fda approval to sell competing rapid hiv blood tests  and bio rad laboratories received fda approval for a rapid hiv blood test 
under their current fda approvals  these tests compete with our oraquick advance test in the hospital or other laboratory settings 
in addition  trinity biotech has received clia waiver for its rapid finger stick hiv blood test  and this test competes with our oraquick advance test in markets outside of the traditional hospital and laboratory settings 
these companies  or others  may continue to expand the bodily fluids with which a rapid hiv test may be performed or develop and commercialize new rapid tests  either of which would provide further competition for our oraquick advance test 
sales to the substance abuse testing market also increased during  reflecting the growing acceptance of our intercept collection device and related oral fluid drug assays  as corporate and criminal justice customers continued to shift to oral fluid and away from traditional urine based drug testing 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales of our drug assays to the forensic toxicology market and lower sales of our uplink product 
we expect continuing growth in the utilization of our intercept product line  primarily in the united states and united kingdom 
in april  samhsa published proposed guidelines that would  if adopted  include oral fluid testing as an accepted drug testing method for federal employees 
we have responded to samhsa s proposed guidelines with a comment letter and await the final guidelines that will apply to our intercept drugs of abuse testing product 
we are unable to predict at this time whether additional modifications may be required to bring our intercept product into compliance with the guidelines when finally adopted or what affect  if any  non compliance with the final guidelines will have on our product offerings 
compliance with the guidelines will be required in order for us to sell our drug testing products to federal employees and possibly other industries that are influenced by the federal guidelines in structuring their drug testing programs 
as part of the strategic business review we completed in late  we concluded that the roadside drugs of abuse testing market for uplink may not be as attractive as a number of other opportunities we are pursuing 
during the first six months of  we explored our options with respect to the uplink product  
table of contents including transitioning the manufacturing of the product to our distribution partner  dr ger safety 
throughout this period  we were not able to reach an agreement with dr ger safety or determine an alternative outlet for this product 
in addition  we were advised that dr ger would no longer promote the sale of the uplink product 
as a result  we recorded a million charge in june to reflect a provision on inventory and fixed assets related to our uplink product 
we subsequently terminated our existing research  development and distribution agreements with dr ger for the uplink product 
sales to the cryosurgical systems market during have also grown  primarily as a result of our launch into the international over the counter otc market 
the cryosurgical systems market represents sales of histofreezer into both the domestic and international physicians office markets and sales of the otc formulation of this product to both our domestic distributor  a subsidiary of prestige brands holdings  inc prestige  and our international distributor  ssl international plc ssl 
prestige distributes freeze off to consumers under its compound w trademark in the otc market in the united states and canada  and is the owner of both tradenames 
in june  we entered into an agreement with ssl under which we manufacture and supply  and ssl distributes on an exclusive basis  the company s cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc market in europe  australia and new zealand 
the product is manufactured and sold under ssl s scholl and dr 
scholl trademarks  and was initially available for retail purchase in pharmacies and retail outlets in several european countries in the fourth quarter of the product is also expected to be made available for retail purchase in other countries during in july  we filed a lawsuit against schering plough healthcare products  inc schering plough for infringement of several of our patents relating to the technology for the cryosurgical removal ie  freezing of warts and other benign skin lesions 
the suit was commenced in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  and alleges that schering plough s manufacture and sale of its dr 
scholl s freeze away cryosurgical wart removal product in the over the counter market infringes three of our patents 
we are seeking injunctive relief and the payment of damages  and schering plough has raised several defenses  including that their freeze away device does not infringe our patents and that one or more of our patents are either invalid or unenforceable 
on november   a pretrial conference was held in this matter  at which the court heard oral argument on motions for summary judgment filed by the parties 
we expect the court to rule on these and other motions and to set a new trial schedule in the near future 
sales to the insurance risk assessment market continued to decline in  primarily because of a reduction in the number of applications for life insurance and changes in underwriting requirements 
in addition  our insurance testing assays have experienced substantial competitive pressure from home brew assays internally developed by our customers 
revenues to this market are expected to continue to decline or at best remain at approximately the levels attained in unless we are successful in developing and commercializing new oral fluid based diagnostic tests for additional predictive health markers desired by the insurance industry 
during  we received all necessary fda approvals to transfer the manufacture of our intercept and orasure collection devices and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test from oregon to our facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
this transfer was completed and has reduced our annual operating expenses and improved our ability to control the quality of the transferred products 
in january  the lease on our oregon facility expired and all operations at that location ceased 
the absence of this lease also reduced our operating expenses in because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
any delay or interruption in our ability to manufacture the oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test would adversely affect sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device  as our customers are not expected to purchase orasure devices if an oral fluid western blot hiv 
table of contents confirmatory test is not readily available 
in addition  if the hiv eia approved by the fda for use with our orasure collection device  which is manufactured by a third party  is either unavailable or experiences quality or performance problems  sales of our orasure device could be adversely affected 
we generated of our revenues in the us marketplace 
consequently  we are evaluating strategies to increase our sales penetration in markets outside the us as our business in foreign countries increases  we will be exposed to additional risks  including economic  political  exchange rate  regulatory and cultural risks 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test  our intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays  and our international otc cryosurgical product  partially offset by declines in domestic otc cryosurgical product revenues and assay revenues in the insurance risk assessment market 
revenues derived from products sold in countries outside the us were million and million  or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

as of december   all shipments have been completed under the cdc purchase order and  remains to be shipped under the samhsa purchase order 
we expect to complete shipment of the remaining devices pursuant to the samhsa purchase order in early we believe that our oraquick advance device  which is fda approved for detecting antibodies to both hiv and in oral fluid  finger stick and venous whole blood  and plasma samples  and is clia waived for use with all sample types except plasma  provides a significant competitive advantage and will allow us to more fully implement a strategy to sell oraquick internationally 
we are currently pursuing ce marking for our oraquick advance product which would allow us to sell our product in europe 
our goal is to obtain a ce mark for oraquick advance in the next several months  and then obtain several country specific registrations in order to permit the launch of this product in europe in the second half of although sales of oraquick advance are expected to increase  such sales may negatively impact sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market 
customers who now or in the future may purchase our orasure device for hiv testing may elect instead to purchase our oraquick advance tests 
it is not possible at this time  however  to estimate the extent of such change in purchasing patterns or the financial impact of replacing orasure sales with sales of our oraquick advance test

as a result  we recorded a million charge in june to reflect a provision on inventory and fixed assets related to our uplink product 
we subsequently terminated our existing research  development and distribution agreements with dr ger for the uplink product 
sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to million in this increase was primarily due to the international 
table of contents launch of our otc cryosurgical product pursuant to our agreement with ssl  the launch of the freeze off product by prestige in canada  and an increase in sales of histofreezer to united states physicians offices 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in sales of the freeze off product to prestige for distribution in the united states  to million in  compared to million during the freeze off product is being sold under prestige s compound w trademark 
the five year distribution agreement with prestige  which was initiated in  requires minimum purchases of at least million each year over the life of the contract in order for prestige to maintain its exclusive distribution rights to the otc market in the united states 
during the second half of  prestige also launched our otc cryosurgical product in canada 
sales of our cryosurgical product to prestige for distribution in canada were million in in june  we entered into an agreement with ssl under which we manufacture and supply  and ssl distributes on an exclusive basis  the company s cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand

we anticipate that us sales of histofreezer in the professional market will continue to increase in revenues in the international market are expected to increase above levels as we increase prices in certain countries and secure additional distributors in countries where the product is currently not sold 
we are beginning to see some evidence that sales of our otc cryosurgical products may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the professional market 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the magnitude of the financial impact of this change 
sales to the insurance risk assessment market declined by to million in from million in  primarily as a result of decreased orasure device purchases by our insurance lab testing partners 
we believe this decrease is a result of an overall reduction in life insurance application activity in the united states and changes in underwriting requirements 
as a result  we currently expect that our revenues in this market segment will decline or at best remain at approximately the levels attained in we currently have two customers  prestige and quest diagnostics including its wholly owned subsidiary  labone  inc  which accounted for and of total revenues for  respectively 
licensing and product development revenues decreased to  in  from  in the comparable period in licensing and product development revenues in both years were primarily related to our collaborative upt and oral fluid research project with the university of pennsylvania and new york university  under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health 
the current annual phase of this grant expires in june our share of funding under the current annual phase is expected to be  of which  was recorded in further revenues beyond june will depend on progress achieved in the research  the level of future funding awarded by the national institutes of health  and the company s decisions regarding the future of upt 

table of contents the company s gross margin was in  compared to in our gross margin was positively impacted by more efficient utilization of the company s manufacturing capacity and renegotiated terms for the assembly and supply of the us otc cryosurgical product  offset by a less favorable product sales mix and the million charge related to the company s uplink assets 
gross margin is expected to increase in as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies  increased prices on certain products  and continued efforts to reduce costs  partially offset by stock option and other non cash stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses decreased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of lower overall staffing costs and lower expenses for clinical trials  partially offset by fees paid and restricted stock granted to recruit and relocate the company s new chief science officer and senior vice president  regulatory affairs quality assurance 
research and development costs are expected to increase in primarily as a result of costs associated with the development of new product offerings and product enhancements for the infectious disease and substance abuse markets and the expensing of stock options

we expect that sales and marketing expense will increase in as we attempt to increase our presence in the international marketplace and expand market awareness and acceptance for our oraquick  intercept and histofreezer products 
pursuant to our agreement with prestige  we will continue to co invest in prestige s marketing activities for the compound w freeze off product  and we will reimburse prestige  through  for a portion of prestige s out of pocket costs of advertising and promoting this product in the otc market 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to legal fees associated with the schering plough litigation  increased amortization of restricted stock grants to management  and increased staffing related expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses  a reduction in transition expenses related to the company s former chief executive officer  and a reduction in rent expense due to the expiration of the lease for our oregon facilities in january legal fees associated with the schering plough patent infringement litigation were million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase further in compared to as a result of the adoption of stock option expensing  increased non cash stock compensation expense  and expenses related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system

at december   the company had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of million 
our ability to use the nols and tax credit carryforwards to offset future income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of the company s capital stock 
internal revenue code section section contains provisions that limit the amount of nols and tax credit carryforwards that can be used in any given year  in the event of a significant ownership change 
in the fourth quarter of  the company engaged in an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any section ownership changes have occurred that would limit 
table of contents the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our forecasted taxable income or to realize the related deferred tax asset 
prior to december   a valuation allowance had been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset created by these carryforwards and other items 
based on current year and forecasted taxable earnings  a significant portion of the valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter of  resulting in the recognition of million of the deferred tax asset of which million was recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations and million was recorded directly as an increase in stockholders equity 
partially offsetting this benefit was an income tax provision of  that was recorded for the year ended december  related to certain state income taxes and federal alternative minimum tax

the tax reform act of contains provisions that limit the amount of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
we retained independent tax specialists to perform an analysis to determine the applicable annual limitation applied to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards due to ownership changes as defined in section that may have occurred 
the section study and analysis was completed in the fourth quarter  and as a result of this study  we do not believe that the ownership change limitations would impair our ability to use our net operating losses against our current forecasted taxable income 
prior to december   a valuation allowance had been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset created by these carryforwards and other items 
based on current year and forecasted taxable earnings  a significant portion of the valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter of  resulting in the recognition of million of the deferred tax asset 

table of contents the combination of our current cash position  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility is expected to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  the costs of defending against patent infringement or other types of litigation  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the potential exercise of our options to purchase one  or both  of our leased facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania  and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition for up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestone is not achieved 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
any significant increase in product warranty claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which the claims occur 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in   and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
also  at december   million  or of our accounts receivable  was due from two major customers 
any significant changes in the liquidity or financial position of these customers  or others  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories 
table of contents carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during   and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of million   and  respectively  as a result of a provision for loss on our uplink product in  scrap levels and product expiration issues 
during the first half of  we explored options with respect to the uplink product  however  we were not able to determine an outlet for this product 
as a result  we recorded a million charge in june to reflect a provision on the uplink inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and an investment in a nonaffiliated entity  and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets have a net book value of million or of our total assets at december  our investment in a privately held nonaffiliated company is recorded under the cost method of accounting because we do not have a controlling interest in this company nor do we have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of this investee company 
property and equipment  patents and product rights are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
in august  we recorded a million intangible asset related to a payment under a license agreement to certain patents related to the hepatitis c virus 
management s intent in executing this license is to provide for various alternatives for use  including uses in the international market that would not require additional research and development expense or regulatory approvals 
this million asset was capitalized based on management s estimate of the cash flows to be received from future product sales in these international markets 
a similar analysis of estimated future cash flows will be prepared upon payment of additional license fees under this agreement  or upon changes in circumstances  to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for payments under this license agreement 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology  and negative financial performance of the nonaffiliated investee company 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
in june  we recorded a  provision for loss on our uplink fixed assets as a result of our inability to reach an agreement to transfer these assets to our distribution partner or determine an alternative outlet for these assets 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all other long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any additional impairment losses through december  any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal net operating losses nol of million 
the net deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 

table of contents our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations  could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal net operating loss carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes have occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our forecasted taxable income or to realize the related deferred tax asset 
prior to december   a valuation allowance had been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset created by these carryforwards and other items 
based on our results and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized  we believe a significant portion of the deferred tax asset was realizable at december  as such  we recorded the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at december  and have begun providing for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us government and agency obligations  state and local government agency obligations  asset backed obligations  and us corporate bonds 
all such instruments are classified as available for sale securities 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
if changes in interest rates would affect the investments adversely  we could decide to hold the security to maturity or sell the security 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in the netherlands  which are subject to foreign 
table of contents currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from euros to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency represented million or of our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material in the near future
