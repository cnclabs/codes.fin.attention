all our stores offer complete pet training services  and virtually all our stores feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services 
through our strategic relationship with banfield  the pet hospital  and other third party operators  we made full service veterinary care available in of our stores as of january  in fiscal  we began a national roll out of the petshotel boarding and day camp concept 
as of january   we operated petshotels within our retail stores in addition to one stand alone location 
in october  we launched our test of the doggie day camp concept  which is also available at our petshotel locations

executive summary fiscal diluted earnings per common share increased to  on net income of million  compared to diluted earnings per common share of on net income of million in fiscal the increase is due to a combination of revenue gains and gross profit rate improvement  partially offset by an increase in operating  general and administrative expenses  net interest expense and income taxes 
net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal due to new store openings and an increase in comparable store sales 

table of contents we added net new stores during fiscal  and at the end of the fiscal year  operated stores 
in addition  we opened new petshotels and six doggie day camps 
we expect to open approximately net new stores and new petshotels in fiscal comparable store sales  or sales in stores open at least a year  increased during fiscal on top of a increase during fiscal we project same store sales growth in the mid single digits for fiscal services sales increased to million  or of net sales for fiscal services sales increased to million  or of net sales during fiscal gross margins increased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal as we improved buying practices and saw results from our ongoing pricing strategies and increased inventory levels resulting in more of our costs being capitalized in inventory 
improved margins on product sales were partially offset by increased occupancy and warehousing costs related to new store openings and the opening of our illinois distribution facility and increased inventory related costs 
operating  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in compensation costs and an increase in legal settlements recognized  partially offset by increases in advertising and store opening expenses as a percentage of sales 
during fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million and we declared cash dividends totaling per share 
cash capital expenditures for were million  and we anticipate spending between million and million for capital expenditures in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  insurance liabilities and reserves  reserve for closed stores  reserves against deferred tax assets and tax contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
stores perform physical inventories once a year  and between the physical inventories  the stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
distribution centers and forward distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter or perform an annual physical inventory 
due to the holiday season  the majority of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the fiscal year  but continue to perform counts on certain inventory items 
therefore  as of the end of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their recorded cost 
obsolescence reserves are recorded so inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer 
table of contents preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
during fiscal  we increased our obsolescence reserve to account for certain obsolete inventory by million to million  as of january  reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
we calculate the costs for future occupancy payments  net of expected sublease income  associated with closed stores using the net present value method  at a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  over the remaining life of the lease 
we use judgment to estimate the underlying real estate market related to the expected sublease income and timing of the sublease start date  and we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
as of january  and january   we had and stores included in our closed store reserve  of which and were under sublease agreements  respectively 
in addition to the stores with sublease agreements as of january   we have assumed that three stores will have sublease income in future periods  which represents a million reduction to the reserve 
if these sublease assumptions were extended by a year from the anticipated commencement date of the assumed sublease term  the reserve would increase by approximately million 
we closed seven stores in fiscal and nine stores in fiscal  of which two stores in fiscal closed as scheduled due to lease expiration and two stores were closed under lease termination agreements 
the closed store reserves are as follows in thousands january  january  total remaining gross occupancy costs less expected sublease income interest costs closed store reserve insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of pets  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies through january   we retained the initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence 
effective february   we engaged a new insurance provider 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies with the new provider  we retain an initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence on or subsequent to february  we establish reserves for losses based on semi annual independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events  and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of january  and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance policies 

table of contents income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january  and january  were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we accrue for potential income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon our view of the likely outcomes of current and future audits 
we adjust our accrual for income tax contingencies for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as amendments to existing tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
at january   we had an accrual for income tax contingencies of million 
if the amounts ultimately settled with tax authorities are greater than the accrued contingencies  we must record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent amounts are ultimately settled for less than the accrued contingencies  or we determine that a liability to a taxing authority is no longer probable  the contingency is reversed as a reduction of income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of approximately million 
the period of assessment  during which additional tax may be imposed for years prior to  has expired for several jurisdictions 
as a result  we determined that approximately million of tax contingency reserves are no longer probable of assertion and have reduced them accordingly  with approximately million as a reduction in expense and approximately million as an increase to additional paid in capital 
we also recorded additional tax expense during the third quarter of fiscal of approximately million resulting from a correction of our deferred tax assets related to equity based compensation recognized for periods prior to fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional tax expense of million resulting from an adjustment to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed an analysis of our net operating loss carryovers related to our fiscal purchase of petsmart 
com  based on guidance issued from the internal revenue service 
as a result  we expect to utilize an additional million of net operating losses previously considered unavailable 
we recorded a total tax benefit of million in the second quarter of fiscal related to the additional net operating loss utilization 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
the internal revenue service is currently examining our tax returns for fiscal  and while the examination has not been finalized  no issues have been identified that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
during fiscal  we raised an affirmative issue with the internal revenue service with respect to the characterization of certain losses 
final agreement has not been reached with the internal revenue service on this issue and  therefore  no benefit has been reflected in the consolidated financial statements related to this item 
management currently estimates that the range of potential benefit will be between zero and approximately million 
any amount ultimately sustained would be reflected as a reduction of income tax expense in the fiscal quarter in which final agreement is reached with the internal revenue service

 statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal net sales increased million  or  to billion  compared to net sales of billion in fiscal  due to the addition of net new stores since january  and a increase in comparable store sales for fiscal our comparable store sales growth was for fiscal we believe the decrease in our comparable store sales growth rate during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to general economic conditions  including increased fuel prices  which caused a decrease in consumer spending 
in addition  we lost days of sales from store closures due to the effect of hurricanes in the third quarter of fiscal services sales  which are included in our net sales and include grooming  pet training  boarding and day camp operations  increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in grooming volume during fiscal gross profit gross profit increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase reflects higher margins on product sales due to improved buying practices  our ongoing pricing strategies and increased inventory levels resulting in more of our costs capitalized in inventory 
these increases were partially offset by various fixed and variable expenses in cost of sales including occupancy  warehousing and transportation costs and inventory related costs 
store and occupancy costs increased as we opened more stores and opened our illinois distribution facility 
warehousing and transportation costs increased due to additional variable expenses from our illinois distribution facility and higher fuel prices 
inventory related costs increased due to higher inventory shrinkage results and higher obsolescence charges 
in addition  gross profit on our services decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the increase in variable and infrastructure expenses associated with the opening of new petshotels 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses  or og a  decreased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal  from for fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by decreases in compensation costs and

we also recorded additional tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and million in the third quarter of fiscal resulting primarily from adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
offsetting these increases to the effective rate  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of million related to reductions in certain tax reserves that we determined would no longer be needed 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased million  or  to billion for fiscal  compared to net sales of billion for fiscal the sales increase was due to net new stores and a increase in comparable store sales for fiscal services sales  which are included in our net sales and include grooming  pet training  pet boarding and day camp operations  increased by  or million  to million

operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to for  from for the increase was primarily due to increases in workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance costs as well as higher repairs and maintenance costs in our stores 
the higher insurance costs were primarily due to increases in actuarial estimates for workers compensation and general liability claims 
in addition  we recognized a million expense in the second quarter of fiscal primarily for the retirement of 
table of contents assets and additional amortization related to store lighting replacements 
the increases were offset by lower advertising  bonus and closed store expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal we also recognized a million gain from a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income increased to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest rates

the reduction in the effective tax rate from fiscal to is primarily due to an analysis of our net operating loss carryovers related to our fiscal purchase of petsmart 
com 
we completed the analysis in the second quarter of and it was based on guidance issued from the internal revenue service 
as a result  we expect to utilize an additional million of net operating losses previously considered unavailable 
we recorded a total tax benefit of million in the second quarter of fiscal  related to the additional net operating loss utilization 
in addition  we recognized a legal settlement of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which allowed us to use a portion of our capital loss carryforwards 
we reversed a previously established valuation allowance  and as a result  recorded a tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and balance sheet data the following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands january  january  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total we manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in order to fund operating requirements

cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund growth in inventory and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities

we expect capital spending to be approximately million to million for fiscal  based on our current plan to open approximately net new stores and new petshotels  to fixture and equip a new distribution center in newnan  georgia  which is expected to open in fiscal  to continue our investment in the development of our information systems  to add to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons  to remodel or replace certain store assets and to roll out our store refresh program

as of january   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 
related party transactions we have an investment in mmi holdings  inc  or mmih  a provider of veterinary and other pet related services 
mmih  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  or mmi  operates full service veterinary hospitals inside of our stores  under the registered trademark of banfield  the pet hospital 
philip l 
francis  our chairman and chief executive officer  and robert f 
moran  our president and chief operating officer  are members of the board of directors of mmih 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
during the second quarter of  we purchased an additional million of mmih capital stock from certain mmih stockholders  and as of january   we owned approximately of the voting stock and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of mmih 
we charge mmi licensing fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals  and we treat this income as a reduction of the retail 
table of contents stores occupancy costs 
we record occupancy costs as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
licensing fees are determined by fixed costs per square foot  adjusted for the number of days the hospitals are open and sales volumes achieved 
we recognized licensing fees of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we also charge mmi for its portion of specific operating expenses and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expenses

subsequent to january   we determined that we were in technical non compliance under our credit facility during a portion of fiscal in march  the lender group waived such past non compliance  and we are currently in compliance with our credit facility 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profit during the fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses  such as advertising  could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a fiscal year 
sales of certain products and services designed to address pet health needs are seasonal 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
finally  as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store openings and related preopening expenses  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores  and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate

there were no non audit services approved by the audit committee in the fourth quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in our credit standing 
in addition  a market risk exists associated with fuel prices 
interest rate risk we have the ability to use a revolving line of credit and short term bank borrowings to support seasonal working capital needs and to finance capital requirements of the business 
there were no borrowings during fiscal or foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  we believe that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to a relatively limited number of transactions and accounts denominated in foreign currency 
approximately million  or of net sales for fiscal  were denominated in the canadian dollar 
transaction gains and losses on united states dollar denominated transactions are recorded within cost of sales or operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  depending on the nature of underlying transactions 
during the second quarter of  we implemented a new structure in our canadian subsidiary that we believe will allow us to minimize the impact of future transaction gains and losses 
we had net exchange gains approximating million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as well as net exchange losses approximating million in fiscal
