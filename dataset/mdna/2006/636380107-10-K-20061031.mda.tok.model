item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain trends expected to impact future results of operations 
changes in the mix of the company s patients among medicare  medicaid and other payer sources may also affect the company s revenues and profitability 
risks related to the company s acquisition strategy 
in recent years  the company s strategic focus has been on the acquisition of small to medium sized home health care agencies  or of certain of their assets  in targeted markets 
these acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties  including difficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into the company s business  the potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies  the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the diversion of management attention from existing operations 
the company may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with its own in an efficient and cost effective manner 
the failure to effectively integrate any of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s growth over the last several years has principally resulted from acquisitions and penetration of markets abandoned by competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or available market share in the future nor that any such opportunities  if identified  will be consummated on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
in the absence of such successful transactions  there can be no assurance that the company will experience further growth  nor that such transactions  if consummated  will result in further growth 
in addition  although the company attempted in its acquisitions to determine the nature and extent of any pre existing liabilities  and has obtained indemnification rights from the previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of the acquisition  resolving issues of liability between the parties could involve a significant amount of time  manpower and expense on the part of the company 
if the company or any of its subsidiaries were to be unsuccessful in a claim for indemnity from a seller  the liability imposed on the company or its subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has grown significantly over the past few years 
this growth  which has resulted primarily from acquisitions and which management intends to continue to pursue  poses a number of difficulties and risks for the company 
as the company has grown and may continue to grow as to which there can be no assurance in both revenue and geographical scope  such growth stretches the various resources of the company  including management  information systems  regulatory compliance  logistics and other controls 
there can be no assurance that such resources will keep pace with such growth 
if the company does not maintain such pace  then its prospects would be materially adversely affected 
risks related to the company s dependence on senior management 
the company believes that the success of its business strategy and its ability to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of its senior management team 
if any member of the company s senior management team becomes unable or unwilling to continue in his present position  the company s business and financial results could be materially adversely affected

item legal proceedings 
on february   lerai jones  individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated  filed a lawsuit against the company for alleged unpaid overtime wages pursuant to the new york labor law 
in this lawsuit  the plaintiff seeks to certify a class of regular full time hourly employees employed by allen health care located and working within the state of new york 
the legal issues in this case are closely intertwined and connected to the legal issues currently being litigated in the matter of coke v 
long island care at home  f 
d d cir 
which involves the exemption for home health care aides under the fair labor standards act 
on august   upon a remand from the united states supreme court  the united states district court for the second circuit affirmed the decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruling that the exemption did not apply to home health aides employed by third parties 
this decision  however  has been stayed pending an appeal to the united states supreme court and the defendant in the coke decision is currently in the process of appealing this decision to the united states supreme court 
thus  because of this pending appeal of the coke decision  the parties in the matter of lerai jones  et al 
v 
national home health care  have agreed to enter into a stipulation extending the defendant s time to answer the complaint or agreeing to have plaintiff stipulate to a discontinuance of this matter within thirty days after a ruling in the coke decision by the united states supreme court 
based on the united states supreme court s earlier remand  the company believes that the supreme court will overturn the decision of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and uphold the exemption from overtime wages for home health aides 
on october   allen health care received an information subpoena with restraining notice by certified mail in connection with a judgment obtained by ida faulkner against allen health care in the amount of  entered on default on january  in the supreme court of new york  bronx county

general the following discussion and analysis provides information which the company s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere herein 
the company is subject to external factors that could significantly impact its business  including potential reductions in reimbursement rates by medicare  medicaid and other third party payers for the company s services  retroactive adjustments due to prior year audits  reviews and investigations  government fraud and abuse initiatives and other such factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors could cause future results to differ materially from historical results 
as a medicaid provider in connecticut  the company is subject to routine  unscheduled audits 
these audits may result in the application of a statistically derived adjustment factor to the company s revenues  which may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in august  the company s operations in connecticut for the period of april  through march  were audited 
during the audit period  the company received approximately  in reimbursement 
the audit resulted in a claim being made by the connecticut department of social services dss in the amount of approximately  the company has recorded a liability of the claim asserted by dss in the accompanying financial statements 
there can be no assurance that future medicaid audits will not have a material adverse impact on the company 
the impact of the balanced budget act the balanced budget act was signed into law in august the act made significant changes in the reimbursement system for medicare home health care services 
the primary change affecting the company was a restructuring of the reimbursement system related to medicare certified home health care agencies 
prior to the act  medicare reimbursed providers on a reasonable cost basis subject to program imposed cost per visit limitations 
under the act  changes in medicare home care reimbursement were scheduled in two phases 
a temporary or interim payment system ips took effect for cost reports beginning on or after october  under ips  home health care providers were reimbursed the lowest of i their actual costs  ii cost limits based on of median costs of freestanding home health agencies  or iii an agency specific per patient cost limit  based on costs adjusted for inflation 
under ips  most medicare providers were actually reimbursed under an agency specific per patient cost limit 
effective october   under the prospective payment system  medicare now reimburses providers a predetermined base payment 
the payment is adjusted for the health condition and care needs of the beneficiary and is also adjusted for geographic differences in wages across the country 
medicare provides home health agencies with payments for day episodes of care 
the final phase of the act implemented a cut in medicare reimbursement rates effective october  in two of the last three fiscal years  less than five percent of the company s net patient revenue was derived directly from medicare  and accordingly the change to the prospective payment system has not  to date  had a material adverse impact on the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the medicare prospective payment system will not adversely impact the company s reimbursement rates in the future or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s operations in new york are dependent upon referrals  primarily from medicare certified home health care agencies  whose reimbursement has been affected by the prospective payment system 
under the prospective payment system  there can be no assurance that the company s future referrals will not result in reduced reimbursement rates or reduced volume of business 
recent acquisitions the following acquisitions were made through one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
these acquisitions complemented the existing business of the company in the geographical area in which the entity whose assets were acquired provided services 
each of the acquisitions described below was accounted for utilizing purchase accounting principles 
at the time of its acquisition  the revenues of each acquired business constituted less than ten percent of the consolidated revenues of the company 
on may   the company acquired through accredited certain assets of helping hands  a licensed home health care company in the state of new jersey that provided home health aide services in bergen  hudson  passaic  essex  morris  union  middlesex  somerset and ocean counties  new jersey 
on october   the company acquired through new england certain assets of on duty metropolitan connecticut  llc on duty  a medicare certified and state licensed home health care company that provided nursing and home health care services in new haven and fairfield counties  connecticut 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are those policies relating to recognizing net patient revenue  determining the value of accounts receivable  and assessing the value of goodwill and other long lived assets 
net patient revenue 
the company recognizes net patient revenue generally on the date services are provided to patients 
net patient revenue is recorded at amounts the company expects to receive under reimbursement arrangements with third party payers  including private insurers  private payers  subcontractors  medicaid and medicare 
because the company s business depends upon third party payers whose reimbursement rates and payment policies are complex and subject to possible change from time to time  the company must make estimates with respect to certain amounts it records as the net realizable value of net patient revenue and accounts receivable 
because of the potential for changes in these third party reimbursement rates and payment policies  and as a result of the complexity of certain of these policies  the estimated amounts originally recorded as net patient revenue and accounts receivable may be subject to revision as additional information becomes known 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for possible losses that provides a reserve with respect to those accounts for which net patient revenue was recognized but with respect to which management subsequently determines that payment is not expected to be received 
the company analyzes the balances of accounts receivable to ensure that the recorded amounts properly reflect the amounts expected to be collected 
this analysis involves the application of varying percentages to each accounts receivable category based on the age and the collectibility of the receivable 
the result of this aging analysis provides the initial estimate of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable 
the amount ultimately recorded as the reserve is determined after management also analyzes the collectibility of specific large or problematic accounts on an individual basis  as well as the overall business climate and other factors 
the company s estimate of the percentage of uncollectible accounts may change from time to time and any such change could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill arising from the acquisitions of businesses is recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets provides that goodwill is to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
consistent with this standard  the company reviews goodwill  as well as other intangible assets and long term assets  for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted  and if circumstances indicate that the recorded value of any such other asset is impaired  such asset is written down to its proper value 
the company currently does not believe any impairment of its goodwill or any such other asset existed at july  nevertheless  future conditions or events could adversely affect the recorded value of goodwill or such other assets 
if any item of goodwill or such other asset is determined to be impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount by which the recorded value exceeds the estimated fair market value
