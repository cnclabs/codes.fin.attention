item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview this has been a very difficult year in the north american supplier market  especially for those suppliers who sell predominately to general motors and ford and are most heavily oriented to the sport utility vehicle suv platforms 
being one of those suppliers  we had been able to thrive in past years 
today  however  that customer concentration on primarily domestic suv platforms has exposed us to unprecedented margin compression and volume constriction 
additionally  pricing pressures continue to intensify as suppliers in asia and other areas of the world enter our market and existing domestic competitors have become more aggressive in their efforts to fill available plant capacity 
while we have ongoing programs to reduce our own costs through process automation and identification of industry best practices  and have been successful in substantially mitigating these pricing pressures in the past  it has become increasingly more difficult to do so 
given the continuing nature of these pricing pressures today  and the lengthy time periods necessary to implement best practices and to reduce labor and other costs through automation  our profit margins will continue to be less than our historical levels 
we will continue to attempt to increase our operating margins from current operating levels by aggressively implementing cost savings strategies to meet customer pricing expectations and increasing industry wide price competition 
however  the initial impact of these strategies on our future financial position and results of operations will be negative  the extent to which cannot be predicted  and even if successfully implemented these strategies may not be sufficient to offset the impact of pricing pressures on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 

table of contents several specific actions were taken during the fourth quarter of in order to preserve our financial strength going forward 
in  we embarked on a diversification effort to broaden our product offering to our customers and achieve accelerated revenue growth 
we combined our expertise in aluminum casting with our long term customer base to begin manufacturing aluminum suspension components 
unfortunately  we were never able to realize the profitability necessary to sustain our presence in this business 
through  we had made a significant investment in the aluminum suspension components business and had incurred significant losses since inception 
our plan was to improve profitability by increasing sales to our oem customers and by improving our production capabilities 
however  following the launch of a major program in the second half of and updating our long range forecasts for this business  it became apparent that we would not be able to recover our investment in this business 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax asset impairment charge totaling million 
also  on january  we announced the potential disposition of this operation in order to focus on our core wheel business 
the second action taken was to announce a major restructuring of our wheel facility in van nuys  california  which in the future will only produce aluminum wheels requiring specialty processing methods and finishes 
this will result in the layoff of approximately employees in the second quarter of and the accelerated depreciation of certain idled machinery and equipment totaling million pretax in the fourth quarter of  and an additional million pretax in the first quarter of this restructuring will not impact the corporate offices  which are also located at the van nuys facility 
the final action relates to our chrome plating operation in fayetteville  arkansas  where production volumes are currently forecasted to decrease significantly in the latter half of due to a recent shift in the market for chromed wheels to a less expensive chrome finishing process 
accordingly  we also recorded in the fourth quarter of asset impairment and other charges totaling approximately million pretax to write down certain machinery and equipment to estimated fair value and to accrue for the related potential environmental exposures related to machinery and equipment shutdown and removal 
results of operations year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net sales gross profit percent of net sales operating income loss percent of net sales net income loss percent of net sales diluted earnings loss per share sales in  total revenues decreased approximately percent  while unit shipments to our oem customers decreased percent versus the prior year 
consolidated net sales decreased million to million in from million in excluding wheel program development revenues  which totaled million this year compared to million a year ago  aluminum wheel sales decreased million in to million from million a year ago  a percent decrease compared to the percent decrease in unit shipments 
the average selling price of our wheels increased approximately percent in  due principally to the pass through price of aluminum increasing our average selling price by approximately percent 
consolidated net sales in also included million of aluminum suspension component sales compared to million in  including components program development revenues of million and million  respectively 
unit shipments to ford and gm totaled percent of total oem unit shipments in compared to percent a year ago 
unit shipments to daimlerchrysler increased to percent from percent in and to our international customers totaled percent compared to percent in according to automotive news  an industry publication  overall north american production of passenger cars and light trucks in decreased approximately 
table of contents percent compared to our percent decrease in aluminum wheel unit shipments 
for the most part  concentration on gm and ford and particularly  suv and light trucks  caused our shipments to be lower than the overall industry average 
however  production of the specific passenger cars and light trucks using our wheel programs decreased percent compared to our percent decrease in shipments  indicating a slight decrease in market share 
according to ward s automotive yearbook  an auto industry publication  aluminum wheel installation rates on passenger cars and light trucks in the us increased to percent for the model year from percent for the prior model year 
aluminum wheel installation rates have increased to this level since the mid s  when this rate was only percent 
however  in recent years  this rate has slowed  increasing only percent from percent for the model year  a trend which we expect to continue 
in addition  our ability to grow will be negatively impacted by the customer pricing pressure cited above and overall economic conditions that impact the sales of passenger cars and light trucks 
consolidated net sales in increased million  or percent  to million from million in excluding wheel program development revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in  oem wheel sales increased million to million from million in  a percent increase compared to a slight increase in unit shipments of one half a percent 
our slight increase in oem aluminum wheel unit shipments in compared favorably to the decrease of percent in north american automotive production of passenger cars and light trucks 
the average selling price of our wheels in increased approximately percent from due principally to an increase of percent in the pass through price of aluminum 
consolidated net sales in also included million of aluminum suspension components sales compared to million in  including components program development revenues of million and million  respectively 
gross profit the principal factors impacting our gross margin percentage are the continued pricing pressures from our customers and increasing global industry wide competition 
pricing pressures have intensified as suppliers in asia and other areas of the world enter the market and competitors become more aggressive in their efforts to fill open plant capacity 
while we have ongoing programs to reduce costs and  in the past  have been successful in substantially mitigating these pricing pressures  it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so 
however  the initial impact of these strategies on our future financial position and results of operations will be negative  the extent to which cannot be predicted  and even if successfully implemented these strategies may not be sufficient to offset the impact of pricing pressures on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
during  gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in the principal factors impacting our gross profit were continued global pricing pressures from our customers  decreased demand for high volume  high profit specialty wheels  lower capacity utilization and costs associated with the process of consolidating and further automating our production facilities and implementing best practices in an effort to reduce our own cost structure  respond to customer changes in cosmetic and quality standards and improve product flow due to a higher mix of larger diameter wheels 
these factors have caused  and are expected to continue to cause for a period of time  various operating issues and inefficiencies 
these include material handling problems due to the relocation of production equipment and conveyor systems  decreased productivity on larger diameter wheels due to fewer wheels being processed per hour  additional operations required on certain wheels  etc 
as a result  our labor costs were higher than normal because the planned labor savings from the various automation programs being implemented could not be attained due to lower capacity utilization and the deferral of headcount reductions to handle additional rework caused by higher internal reject rates 
also included in gross profit is the gross margin losses of the aluminum suspension component business of million compared to million in the gross margin loss in was greater than anticipated due to our inability to efficiently meet the start up demands of new programs and continued unexpected equipment failures 
these factors caused excessive overtime and additional expense for expedited shipments to meet customer demand 
during  gross profit decreased million to million  or percent of net sales  from million  or percent of net sales  in the principal factors impacting gross profit were continued customer price reductions  decreases in certain high volume  high profit specialty wheels and erratic customer shipment schedules  due to higher than normal customer inventory levels 
to a lesser extent  our gross profit was also impacted by 
table of contents decreased utilization rates in our us manufacturing facilities while three of the plants were being expanded  extra costs and inefficiencies related to these plant expansions and additional costs and delays related to a record number of new wheel program launches 
additionally  the difference between the market price and the fixed price of aluminum delivered during pursuant to our aluminum contracts negatively impacted gross profit 
during the fourth quarter of  all future fixed price aluminum purchase commitments were liquidated at a price that approximated contract value 
the cost of aluminum is a significant component in the overall cost of a wheel 
additionally  a portion of our selling prices to oem customers is attributable to the cost of aluminum 
our selling prices are adjusted periodically to current aluminum market conditions based upon market price changes during specific pricing periods 
theoretically  assuming selling price adjustments and raw material purchase prices move at the same rate  as the price of aluminum increases  the effect is an overall decrease in the gross margin percentage  since the gross profit in absolute dollars would be the same 
the opposite would then be true in periods during which the price of aluminum decreases 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of net sales in  compared to million  or percent of net sales in and million  or percent of net sales in on february   tower automotive  inc  an aluminum suspension components customer  filed to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
selling  general and administrative expenses in include a provision for doubtful accounts totaling million to cover the write off of the tower receivables at december  excluding this provision from  selling  general and administrative expenses were flat with those in and in decreased million  due principally to a reduction of million in bonuses  which are based on profitability 
in  higher retirement costs and professional fees  principally related to audit services  offset lower compensation costs  principally bonuses  due to the decreased profitability 
impairment of long lived assets and other charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in the fourth quarter of  we considered whether events or changes in circumstances suggested the carrying value of certain assets was not recoverable and concluded that such events and changes had occurred 
we then assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at three of our manufacturing facilities as part of our annual impairment assessment process for recoverability and determined that the undiscounted future cash flows did not support the carrying value of those long lived assets at two of the three facilities 
through  we had made a significant investment in the aluminum suspension components business and had incurred significant losses since inception 
our plan was to improve profitability by increasing sales to our oem customers and by improving our production capabilities 
however  following the launch of a major program in the second half of and updating our long range forecasts for this business  it became apparent that we would not be able to recover our investment in this business 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million in our components segment to reduce to their respective fair values the carrying value of its assets  which are classified as held and used as of december  we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets of this segment based on an estimated sales price see below and an independent appraisal of assets 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had authorized us to engage an investment banker and or other advisors to explore options for disposal of the aluminum suspension components segment 
this decision was made due to the intense competition in the global automotive wheel industry  which will require us to focus all of our resources on our core aluminum wheel business 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  the assets of the components segment will be classified as held for sale and the results of operations of this segment will be presented in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
due to a recent shift in the market for chromed wheels to a less expensive chrome finishing process  the sales forecasts for our chromed wheels declined significantly 
accordingly  on december   we concluded that the carrying value of the long lived assets related to this facility were not recoverable and we 
table of contents recorded a pretax impairment charge of million for our chrome plating facility  which is included in our automotive wheel segment  to reduce the carrying value of certain assets to their respective fair values 
other charges recorded in the fourth quarter of in our automotive wheel segment included an accrual of million for potential environmental exposure related to machinery and equipment shutdown and removal  and accelerated depreciation of certain machinery and equipment in our van nuys wheel facility  totaling million 
the accelerated depreciation charge was a result of a change in estimated useful lives of equipment due to our decision to reduce production in that facility to only aluminum wheels requiring special processing methods and finishes 
an additional million charge for accelerated depreciation is expected in the first quarter of interest income  net interest income  net for the year increased percent to million from million in  due principally to an increase in the average rate of return to percent from percent in interest income in increased slightly to million from million in  as the additional interest earned on the million increase in cash available for investment was offset by a slight decrease in the average rate of return in  which approximated percent 
equity in earnings of joint ventures and cumulative effect of accounting change we have two percent owned joint ventures topy superior limited tsl  which earns a commission for marketing our products to potential oem customers based in asia  and suoftec light metal products  ltd 
suoftec  a manufacturer of both light weight forged and cast aluminum wheels in hungary 
the investment in these joint ventures is accounted for utilizing the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  our share of joint venture net income is included in the consolidated statements of operations in equity in earnings of joint ventures 
the net operating results of the tsl joint venture did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in  we aligned the accounting period for our suoftec percent owned joint venture with the fiscal year period reported by our other operations 
our share of the joint venture s net income was previously recorded one month in arrears 
the impact of this change in accounting principle added million  or per diluted share  to our net income in  representing our share of suoftec s earnings for the month of december additionally  our share of the joint venture s operating results for all interim periods in have been adjusted to be comparable with this change in accounting principle effective in the first quarter of our share of profits from the joint venture declined to million for compared to million a year earlier and million in this operation was affected by the same factors that impacted our performance in the north american market  including pricing pressures  lower volumes  and reduced capacity utilization  following an expansion of the cast operation  in order to meet the expected increase in demand of the european aluminum wheel market  which did not materialize 
unit shipments in declined by more than percent for the year  while operating profits were down by approximately percent 
the decrease in profitability in was due principally to a percent decline in unit shipments  lower average selling prices and higher operating costs due to a recent expansion of the casting operation 
the decrease in operating results was partially offset by an increase in the foreign exchange rate of the euro compared to the us dollar
