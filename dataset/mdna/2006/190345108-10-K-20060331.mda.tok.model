item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that we are one the largest wholesale distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs  and boats in north america 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
our sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom after market customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
as a result  recessionary conditions and increases in interest rates often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increase in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats  because these conditions increase the consumers costs and the difficulties of using their rvs and boats 
weather conditions also can affect our operating results  because unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions can reduce the usage of rv and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions and can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
moreover  we have found  at least since september   that usage and purchases of rvs also can be affected by geopolitical conditions 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline and unusually adverse weather conditions and  in some cases  geopolitical events as well 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides income statement data for the fiscal years ended december   and  and compares our fiscal operating results to our operating results in each of the two immediately preceding fiscal years 
dollars are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december increase decrease vs 
increase decrease vs 
amount amount amount amount percent amount percent net sales gross profits selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings net earnings per share diluted there were industry wide declines both in the sales and the usage of rvs and boats in  due to a number of factors  including rising gasoline prices and increases in interest rates and  in the first four months of  unseasonably bad weather conditions  particularly in california which sustained record rainfalls during that period 
notwithstanding those conditions  as the above table indicates  our fiscal sales increased by as compared to  when sales and usage of rvs and boats were relatively strong  and increased by as compared to fiscal we attribute our success in increasing our sales during  despite difficult market conditions  largely to gains in our share of the rv and boating parts and accessories markets 
we believe that those gains were primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of sales of proprietary products  which more than offset the effects on sales of strategic price reductions on selected products during the first half of that we implemented in response to increased price competition from our competitors 

table of contents however  as indicated in the table above  our gross margin  operating income and net income declined in fiscal as compared to the declines in gross margin and operating income were primarily attributable to i higher freight costs  due largely to rising gasoline prices  ii higher steel prices that led to increases in the prices we pay for some of our products  and iii strategic price reductions on selected products in response to increased price competition in our markets 
the decline in net earnings in  as compared to  was due primarily to the combined effects of the reduction in gross profits  the increase in interest expense  which was due primarily to increases in the prime lending rate  which determines the rates at which we pay interest on our bank borrowings  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross profits  operating income and net income were higher in than in  increasing by  and  respectively 
we believe these improvements were largely attributable to increases in the number of proprietary products we source from the far east and increased acceptance and demand  by consumers  of those proprietary products 
outlook for the higher gasoline prices and increased interest rates have continued into and we expect that they will continue to adversely affect purchases and usage by consumers of rvs and boats  at least during the first two quarters of our strategic goals for are to capture additional market share and  thereby  achieve increases in sales  and to improve our gross margin  despite these market conditions  primarily by continuing to increase our sales of proprietary products that we source from the far east  including products from new supply sources in china that we established during the fourth quarter of we generally are able to realize higher margins on sales of proprietary products  which we believe have gained greater acceptance among users of rvs and boats during the past three years and which enabled us to gain market share in  and no assurance can be given  however  that we will be able to achieve these goals because  as is described above under the caption factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products  and in item a of this report  entitled risk factors  our sales and profitability can be affected by a number of conditions that are outside of our control 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including judgments or assumptions we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance  and those judgments and assumptions are  in turn  based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then  based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the prospects for realizing the values at which we have recorded these assets  we may be required  pursuant to gaap  to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves and an allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the amounts at which those allowances are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
those allowances are periodically increased to replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 

table of contents the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as increasing gasoline prices or interest rates or economic slowdowns  will be of short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes  for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
see consolidated financial statements report of independent registered public accounting firm in item of this report 
our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product returns 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 

table of contents allowance for deferred income taxes 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions that can be applied in future periods to offset or reduce our future income tax liability 
at december  the aggregate amount of that deferred tax asset was approximately million 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to use this deferred tax asset depends on the taxable income that we are able to generate during those time periods 
we have made a judgment  based on historical experience and current and anticipated market and economic conditions and trends  that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully use the deferred tax asset that is recorded in our financial statements 
however  if due to future events or circumstances  such as an economic downturn that might adversely affect our operating results  we subsequently come to a different conclusion regarding our ability to fully utilize this asset  we would create a valuation allowance in order to reduce the amount at which we record the deferred tax asset 
the creation of such an allowance would be effectuated by an increase in the provision or a reduction in the credit for income taxes in our statement of income  which would have the effect of reducing our income in the fiscal period in which such provision is recorded 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and goodwill and certain types of identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  based on standards established by sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  derived from our statements of income for the respective periods indicated below year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses operating income interest expense earnings before taxes income tax provision net earnings net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of rv and boating products  net of an allowance for product returns 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the increases in net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal dollars in the table are in thousands 
year ended december  increase vs 
increase vs 

table of contents we believe that the increase in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to an increase in our share of rv after market sales during the year  because the increase in sales was achieved despite an industry wide slowdown in purchases and usage of rvs that was primarily attributable to increases in gasoline prices and interest rates and a decline in consumer confidence 
we believe that we were able to achieve this increase in market share primarily as a result of greater acceptance of and greater demand for our proprietary products in the marketplace  as indicated by increases in our sales of those products to our existing customers and an increase in the number of customers purchasing those products from us  including customers that had not purchased products from us in the past 
the increase in net sales in  as compared to  we believe  was due to a number of factors  including i increased demand for rv products  particularly in the first half of the year  which we believe was largely due to an improving economic environment and relatively low market rates of interest  ii increased acceptance of and greater demand among after market customers for our coast branded proprietary products  and iii an improvement in our service levels to our customers primarily as a result of our inventory management system 
gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of sales from net sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  and warehouse and distribution costs  including freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin in our gross margin declined to  as compared to in this decline was primarily attributable to i increases in freight and shipping costs  ii an increase in steel prices  which affected the prices to us of some of the products we purchased from our suppliers  and iii selected price reductions in the first half of that we implemented in response to increased price competition in our markets as a result of an industry wide slowdown in sales 
the increase in our gross margin in  as compared to  was due primarily to i a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products  including our proprietary products  ii price increases implemented in on selected product lines  iii continued strengthening in the canadian dollar which reduced our canadian subsidiary s cost of purchasing products for resale from us based suppliers  and iv the fact that the fixed components of our warehouses costs were being spread over increased sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  labor and administrative costs  professional fees and expenses and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 
year ended december  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales sg a expenses increased by  or in  due primarily to an increase in promotional and marketing expenses  and to a lesser extent  an increase in selling and administrative labor 
however  as a percent of sales  sg a expenses declined to of net sales in from in in  sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars  by  or  and as a percentage of net sales to as compared to in this increase was due primarily to increases in selling expenses and marketing costs  including the costs of our annual dealer buying show held in the first quarter of the year  and in insurance costs and professional fees 

table of contents the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income as a percentage of net sales the decrease in operating income in  as compared to  was due primarily to the decrease in our gross margin during the year and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  which more than offset the increase in our net sales in the increase in operating income in  as compared to  was due to the combined effects of the increase in our net sales and gross margin  which more than offset the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in other income expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense other total as a percentage of net sales interest expense is the largest component of other income expense 
in interest expense increased by  or as compared to this increase was the result of increases in the rate of interest charged on borrowings under our bank line of credit  due primarily to increases in prevailing market rates of interest to which the interest rate on our borrowings is tied 
in  interest expense decreased by  or as compared to this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in interest rates during income tax provision year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
the decrease in the income tax provision in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to the decrease in taxable income 
the increase in the effective tax rate in  as compared to  was largely due to a tax accrual for unremitted earnings of our foreign affiliate in taiwan 
the increase in the income tax provision in was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  during the period from march through july  and  during the period from august through february  of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and between to of eligible inventory 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the bank s prime rate or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at libor  plus percent 
the revolving credit agreement with the bank contains certain restrictive covenants  including covenants regarding profitability  minimum liquidity ratios  restrictions on investments  and limitations on indebtedness  on payment of dividends  and on mergers and consolidations 
the company was in compliance with all the covenants as of december  at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness of the company 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  certain of our customers receive payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
we have been able to obtain similar extended payment terms from some of our suppliers  which reduced the amounts we had to borrow under our credit facility to make inventory purchases 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain extended payment terms from our suppliers in the future 
if we are unable to do so  it would require us to incur additional borrowings under our credit facility or could adversely affect our ability to timely pay our creditors and to purchase inventory 
also  in the event our customers delay their payments to us  our payments to our creditors would have to be funded with additional bank borrowings or would have to be delayed 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
during  our operations generated cash of more than million  including i net profits of million and ii cash of nearly million attributable to inventory reductions  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and reductions of million in our accounts payable 
those inventory reductions were primarily the result of our implementation of an inventory management program by which we reduced slower moving and less profitable product lines  and a leveling in product sales during we also used cash in primarily ii to reduce our net borrowings under our revolving bank credit line by million  ii to repurchase  of our shares  iii to pay cash dividends of  pursuant to our dividend policy described below  and iv to fund  of capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse equipment related to the relocation and expansion of our visalia  california warehouse and distribution center  and enhancement of our computer system  including purchases of new computer equipment  and purchases of telephone and other warehouse equipment 
we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range between  and  in connection with a planned expansion of our distribution center in st 
bruno  quebec 
those expenditures will be in addition to capital expenditures of a recurring nature  such as for replacement and upgrading of equipment  that we expect will range from  to  
table of contents contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments  at december  in thousands of dollars year ending december  thereafter total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations maturities of contractual obligations less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations totals dividend policy 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends of per share to our stockholders in march  june  september and december of each year 
pursuant to that policy we paid total cash dividends in of  in the first quarter of  our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to per share 
we expect  therefore  to pay cash dividends in totaling approximately  share repurchases 
in  our board of directors adopted share repurchase programs authorizing repurchases by us of up to an aggregate of  of our shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
during  we made share repurchases totaling  pursuant to those programs 
we funded the share repurchases with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
expected uses and sources of funds 
we expect our principal uses for cash in the year ending december  will be to fund operations and the capital expenditures  cash dividends and additional share repurchases and we anticipate that we will be able to fund those cash requirements in with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and internally generated funds 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins 
we plan to establish new product supply relationships  including relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in china and other countries in the far east  and in canada  europe and the united states  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 

table of contents seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august than we do during the remainder of the year 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we sometimes incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when sales are lower due primarily to winter weather conditions 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted quarter ended march  june  september  december  unaudited revenues gross profit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 

table of contents approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant
