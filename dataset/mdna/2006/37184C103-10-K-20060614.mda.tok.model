overview our markets we develop and market image processing and image enhancing solutions 
we design  develop and market integrated circuits that receive and process digital video and graphic images 
we also supply reference boards and designs that incorporate our software and proprietary integrated circuits  or chips 
we have recently introduced a panel timing controller product 
our products are primarily used in large area liquid crystal displays lcds 
these displays may be used in desktop monitor applications or other types of display devices  including lcd tvs  plasma tvs  rear projection tvs  digital crt tvs and avrs audio video receivers 

table of contents we generate the majority of our revenue by selling our image processing solutions to the manufacturers of lcd monitors  flat panel displays and television sets 
we outsource the manufacturing of our products to large semiconductor manufacturers  thereby eliminating the need for capital intensive plant and equipment 
our most significant cash operating expense is labor  with our workforce employed in research and development of new products and technologies and in marketing  sales  customer support  and distribution of our products 
our primary target end markets are lcd computer monitors and flat panel televisions 
we also design products that serve both applications  so called multi function monitors  and it is difficult to distinguish between a monitor with television capability and a television with a pc input 
both of these display devices could use the same genesis chip 
similarly  we supply certain customers with chips originally designed for a lcd computer monitor that the customer may use in flat panel televisions 
we assist customers in developing their designs 
typically  a tv design will take more time and support from our software and field application engineers than a monitor design  increasing our costs during a customer s pre production period 
the growth in our target markets is limited by the industry s capacity to supply lcd panels or other digital displays 
furthermore  the availability of lcd panels from time to time has been constrained  causing unexpected increases in the cost of lcd panels to our customers  thus resulting in customers rapidly changing their demand expectations for our products 
our products usually represent less than two percent of the average retail cost of a standard flat panel tv today  while the cost of the lcd panel within a lcd computer monitor or flat panel tv represents the majority of the cost of the finished product 
consequently  constraints on availability of lcd panels or increases in panel costs can result in reduced demand for our products  and it is very difficult to accurately predict the availability or cost of lcd panels and well beyond our means to control 
conversely  it is the increase in production volumes of larger size lcd panels in new fabrication facilities coming on line over the next several years that is expected to result in lower cost panels and hence lower average selling prices of the end product 
we believe retail prices will continue to decline and we expect this trend to lead to an increase in demand for display controllers 
the lcd computer monitor and flat panel tv industries are very competitive and growth industries like ours tend to attract new entrants 
our average selling prices of monitor display controllers  in spite of increased functionality have declined by more than over the past two fiscal years 
our strategy is to maintain market leadership through integration of new features and functions and by providing the highest image quality at a cost effective price 
we believe we are able to deliver the desired feature rich image quality through relationships with customers  patented technologies  effective chip design  software capabilities  and customer support 
while maintaining our leadership in image quality and product feature sets  we strive to maximize profitability by reducing product cost through efficient chip design and driving costs down throughout our supply chain 
while we primarily market and sell our integrated circuits directly to manufacturers  we have sold finished systems  primarily to the high end home theater market  under the faroudja brand 
these products were generally sold through specialty retail channels and represented a very small portion of our overall revenue less than of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  
during the quarter ended june   we entered into a strategic alliance with meridian audio limited that gives meridian the right to manufacture and distribute genesis s faroudja home theater solutions  and to promote the faroudja brand  on a worldwide basis as part of meridian s product portfolio 
these products will be marketed and distributed through meridian s global distribution network 
while genesis will continue to develop advanced faroudja algorithms for integration into its integrated circuit ic products  it has discontinued the manufacture and sale of home theater systems 
sales to distributors comprised approximately of revenue for the year ended march  this percentage is expected to increase  especially as sales volumes increase in china and japan  where our use of distributors is more prevalent 
we are also using distributor relationships to enable us to increase our market penetration of smaller customers with minimal incremental direct customer support 
average selling prices and product margins of our products are typically highest during the initial periods following product introduction and decline over time and as volume increases 

table of contents part of our overall strategy is to develop intellectual property that is used in our integrated circuits 
we have and will continue to defend our intellectual property rights against those companies that may use our technology without the proper authorization 
at times we may enter into agreements that allow customers or other companies to license our patented technology 
revenue recognition genesis recognizes revenue from semiconductor product sales to customers when a contract is established  the price is determined  shipment is made and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales to distributors may be subject to agreements having a right of return on termination of the distributor relationship 
revenue  and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors  is deferred until the distributors resell the product  verified by point of sale reports 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price  relieve inventory of the value of the product shipped and record the gross margin as deferred revenue  a component of accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
in certain circumstances  where orders are placed with non cancelable non return terms  we recognize revenue upon shipment 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of recognizing revenue 
to date  we have not experienced significant product returns 
manufacturing and supply we generally need to place purchase orders for products before we receive purchase orders from our customers 
this is because production lead times for silicon wafers and substrates  from which our products are manufactured  can be as long as three to four months  while many of our customers place orders only one month or less in advance of their requested delivery date 
we have agreements with suppliers in asia such that we are dependent on the suppliers manufacturing yields 
we continue to review and  where feasible  establish alternative sources of supply to reduce our reliance on individual key suppliers and reduce lead times  though dual sourcing for specific products sometimes is more costly due to initial set up costs and lower initial yields as each new manufacturing supplier ramps up production 
while we have frequent communication with significant customers to review their requirements  we are restricted in our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which exposes us to the risk of having either too much or not enough of a particular product 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory held 
for the year ended march   we recorded net reserves totaling  for inventory which we did not foresee sufficient demand to support the carrying value or where the market price was less than our actual cost 
an example of this would be where certain customers transitioned to next generation products more quickly than anticipated 
global operations we operate through subsidiaries and offices in several countries throughout the world 
our head office is located in alviso silicon valley  california 
our research and development resources are located in the united states  canada and india 
the majority of our customers are located in asia  supported by our sales offices in china  germany  japan  singapore  south korea  and taiwan 
our third party suppliers are located primarily in taiwan 
although all of our revenues and virtually all of our costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our operating expenses are also affected by changes in the rate of inflation in the various countries in which we operate 

table of contents mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments technology companies often use mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments to accelerate development of products  to realize potential synergies or to enter new markets 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past  for example sage inc in february  resulting in the recording of significant intangible assets on our balance sheet 
in april  we entered into a cross licensing agreement with mobilygen corp  a privately held company that is developing h 
and other video codec solutions for mobile devices 
the agreement will give both companies access to certain technologies for select markets and enables them to jointly define future products to complement existing product portfolios 
in addition  genesis made an equity investment in mobilygen  and elias antoun  our president and ceo  joined mobilygen s board of directors 
for details on other mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments  please refer to previously filed annual and quarterly reports 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
as described below  significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence provision  deferred tax asset valuation  potential settlements and costs associated with patent litigation  royalty obligations to third parties and the useful lives of intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and royalty obligations  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns based on historical experience 
a customer has a right to return products only if the product is faulty or upon termination of a distributor agreement  although in certain circumstances we agree to accept returns if replacement orders are placed for other products or to maintain our business relationship 
if actual customer returns increase  we may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue 
we record the estimated future cost of replacing faulty product as an increase to cost of revenues 
to date we have not experienced significant returns related to quality 
if returns increase as a result of changes in product quality  we may be required to recognize additional warranty expense 
we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and other disputes 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not suffered any significant loss in this area 
we provide for inventory obsolescence reserves against our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we provide for costs associated with settling litigation when we believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating those costs 
if actual costs associated with settling litigation differ from our estimates  we may be required to recognize additional costs 

table of contents goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the impairment tests are performed in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level 
we have assigned all goodwill to a single  enterprise level reporting unit 
the impairment test consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill would be determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test on january st of each year 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal   or goodwill balances may also be affected by changes in other estimates  for example  related to the ability to utilize acquired tax benefits  made at the time of acquisitions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our gross deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in making this determination  we project taxable income by jurisdiction for the next three years based on market assumptions and company plans  and other jurisdictional history 
we record an estimated royalty cost based on our assessment of the potential liability arising from our memorandum of understanding mou with silicon image  inc if actual costs associated with the mou differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust the costs 
from time to time  we incur costs related to potential merger activities 
when we assess that we will be the acquirer for accounting purposes in such transactions and we expect to complete the transaction  direct costs associated with the acquisition are deferred and form part of the final purchase price 
in the event these assessments change  any such deferred costs would be expensed 
costs associated with other merger activities are expensed as incurred 

table of contents results of operations revenue and gross profit year ended march in thousands total revenue gross profit gross profit percentage revenue by geography united states china japan south korea taiwan europe rest of world total revenue revenue total revenue for the year ended march  increased by to million from million for the year ended march   which in turn represented a decrease of from million for the year ended march  while unit shipments increased by to million units from million units in fiscal  as the markets in which we operate continue to grow  the increase in dollar terms was slightly offset by lower blended average selling prices asps  which decreased by 
monitor controller asps have continued to decline 
however  estimated revenue from this market increased to million for the year ended march  from million in fiscal  as higher unit shipments were partially offset by asp declines of 
our estimate of unit shipments into flat panel televisions grew by during the year  driving estimated revenue from this market to million  an increase of compared to fiscal total revenues from shipments into displays with video capability  such as lcd television  continue to increase and have become a larger proportion of total revenue 
during fiscal  we estimate that approximately of total revenue was from tv and video products  compared with for fiscal  and we expect this percentage to increase during fiscal unit shipments of all controllers increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  while asps declined by only during the same period  as our tv controllers  which have a much higher asp  increased in volume in relation to the entire units shipped 
we continue to ship the majority of our product to customers located in asia  and we expect most of the growth to come from this area in the future 
within asia  shipments into china and japan have increased significantly over the last two years 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  was million  an increase of approximately compared with fiscal gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with in fiscal and in fiscal maintaining a healthy gross profit margin in a high volume industry where asps decline steadily over time is one of our main challenges 
our long term target for gross margins is approximately 

table of contents operating expenses research and development year ended march dollars in thousands research and development research and development as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses include costs associated with research and development personnel  application engineers  development tools  hardware and software licenses  prototyping and the amortization of acquired intangibles 
research and development expenses for the year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal these annual increases are a reflection of the continued investment in the research and development of technologies addressing the television and video markets  especially the digital tv market and other related technologies  such as timing controllers 
in addition  the mix of spending has changed  as we devote increasing resources to improving performance and integration of the more complex multimedia and video applications  especially digital tv technologies  while the focus within the monitor applications has moved more towards technologies supporting multi function monitors 
genesis s move towards lower geometry processes  including micron and lower  for its highly integrated soc digital tv chips has also increased research and development spending 
selling  general and administrative year ended march dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs for selling  including field application engineers  product marketing  marketing communications  customer support  finance  human resources  legal  it  public company costs related  but not limited to  our compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  general management functions and commissions paid to sales representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million in fiscal from fiscal was related to our investment in additional labor and contractor resources  particularly field application engineers  to support the expected growth in the advanced display market 
we provide technical sales support through field application engineers in china  europe  japan  india  singapore  south korea  and taiwan 
these engineers assist our customers to integrate our products into their display designs 
we believe that this kind of investment at the early stages of a growing market positions us well to capitalize on the future unit growth that is forecasted for the television market 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in fiscal from fiscal of patent litigation costs of million and stock compensation expense of million 
the decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal was due to a reduction of patent litigation costs of million as the majority of the fees in the preceding year were related to our now completed itc trial and related activities in the lcd monitor market 
this reduction was partially offset by additional costs incurred in fiscal including an investment of million for increased labor resources  an increase of million related to stock compensation expense  initial costs of million related to the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and severance and other costs of million associated with the departure of certain employees 

table of contents non operating income and expenses interest and other income year ended march in thousands interest income gain on sale of investment interest income includes interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income earned in fiscal increased by  from  to  due to the combined effects of higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and higher average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest income earned in fiscal increased by  from  to  also due to the combined effects of higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and higher average interest rates during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we sold of our minority interest in a private company for approximately million realizing a gain of million 
the remaining investment with a carrying value of million is included in other long term assets 
provision for income taxes year ended march in thousands current income tax expense deferred income tax expense recovery we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended march   compared with expense of million for the year ended march  and a recovery of million for the year ended march  our accounting effective tax rate for fiscal is  which is substantially lower than the fiscal rate 
our tax rate differs from the expected statutory rates due to several permanent differences including  but not limited to  research and experimental development tax credits  stock based compensation expense  foreign exchange fluctuations on the us dollar denominated working capital balances of foreign subsidiaries  and differences in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
any net tax benefit of these items is partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
historically  the majority of the valuation allowance in the financial statements has been against the tax attributes in the united states 
therefore  the effective tax rate will continue to be directly impacted by the mix of earnings between the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
the increase in tax expense for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal  resulted primarily from much higher profitability 
income tax expense in fiscal also included a charge of approximately million as a result of a repatriation of approximately million of funds by our canadian subsidiary which was treated as a dividend for us tax purposes 
certain provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca  which was signed into law on october   allow for only of this dividend to be taxable  but this may not be sheltered by net operating losses 
this charge in fiscal also increased our effective tax rate for the year 
we do not expect to repatriate any more earnings from international affiliates in the foreseeable future as we consider the investments to be permanent in nature 
the company has not 
table of contents recognized a deferred tax liability of approximately  for the unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates 
as of march   we had generated deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have approximately million of operating loss carry forwards to offset future taxable income 
a portion of the carry forwards expire on various dates through  if not used 
utilization of a portion of net operating losses is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
we have established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss carry forwards 
at march   the valuation allowance totaled million and we have million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
the benefit of million of operating loss carryforwards  which relate to acquired entities or deductions associated with the exercise of certain stock options  if utilized  will result in an increase to equity and or a reduction of goodwill 
future income tax provision amounts will depend on our effective tax rates  the distribution of taxable income between taxation jurisdictions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the amount of research and development performed in canada  other variables  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses

most of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors to manufacturers of flat panel displays  including televisions and lcd monitors 
revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to the relative growth in our target markets  changes in our market share  changes in our customer s market share  the rate of decline in asps  the price of lcd panels  which often impacts demand for our products  and inventory levels of display controllers and finished goods at our customers locations 
gross margins have varied from quarter to quarter depending on changes in product mix  levels of inventory reserves required  level of product yields in the manufacturing process  prices charged by our manufacturing vendors  and the difference in rates of decline of asp s compared to average product costs 
research and development expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to increases in staff levels  the purchase of technology and licenses needed for digital tv development  and the timing of non recurring engineering charges related to new product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to increases in staffing levels for sales and customer support activities  costs associated with compliance of the sarbanes oxley act of  sales and marketing promotional events  and sales commissions 
costs associated with patent litigation have varied from quarter to quarter depending on the level of activity related to specific legal proceedings and the timing of provision for potential settlements 
more details of the legal proceedings are described in item of this report 
income tax expense recovery has varied from quarter to quarter  depending primarily on the levels of taxable income  the distribution of taxable income between jurisdictions  foreign exchange fluctuations  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
our results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include those described under the caption risk factors  among others 
any one or more of these factors could result in our failure to achieve our expectations as to future operating results 
our expenditures for research and development  selling  general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues as a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed as they are dependent on the number of employees  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce our selling prices in response to competitive pressure or other factors  or to increase spending to pursue new market opportunities or to defend ourselves against lawsuits that may be brought against us 
any decline in average selling prices of a particular product that is not offset by a reduction in product costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception we have satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated from operations and sales of equity securities  initially by way of a public offering  and subsequently under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with any cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
periodically  we may be required to use a portion of our cash balances to increase investment in operating assets such as prepaid assets or inventory to assist in the growth of our business  or for capital assets such as land  buildings or equipment 
furthermore  because we do not have our own semiconductor manufacturing facility  we may be required to make deposits to secure supply in the event there is a shortage of 
table of contents manufacturing capacity in the future 
while we currently have no plans to raise additional funds for such uses  we could be required or could elect to seek to raise additional capital in the future 
from time to time we evaluate acquisitions and investments in businesses  products or technologies that are complimentary or strategic to our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders 
march  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital current ratio days sales outstanding inventory days we believe that our financial condition remains strong 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million up from million at march  our current ratio decreased to at march  from at march  we have no debt and we expect to continue to generate cash from operations during fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal and cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal working capital uses of cash included the increase in accounts receivable of million from march  to march  days sales outstanding also increased from days at march  to days at march  this increase reflects the timing of shipments during the period and the anticipated impact of extending payment terms to certain key customers  a trend which is expected to continue as we compete with the terms offered by our competition and as our key customers feel pressure from their own customers to provide more favorable payment terms 
also  as our customers become more established in china  we are becoming more comfortable with extending credit 
our credit policy is to offer credit to customers only after examination of their creditworthiness 
our payment terms range from cash in advance of shipment  to payment sixty days after shipment 
for fiscal  our three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenue  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal additionally  the top three customers accounted for of accounts receivable at march  and at march  lower inventory and higher accounts payable balances reduced overall non cash working capital 
inventory levels decreased during fiscal this decrease primarily reflects the decrease in the average cost of our inventory units on hand and the timing of receipt of inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal average days of inventory during the year ended march  were days compared to days for the year ended march  the average inventory levels and the impact on inventory turns is the result of a number of dynamic activities including the accuracy of customer s forecasts  expected panel supplies  the timing of delivery of inventories  and pricing considerations and is not necessarily an indication of what inventory turns might be in the future 
accounts payable balances increased by million over fiscal  primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended march  this included the net purchases of short term investments of million coupled with capital and other spending of million  and a million investment 
this compared to million provided by investing activities in the year ended march   and million provided by investing activities in fiscal 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended march   million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  this represented funds received for the purchase of shares under the terms of our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
these commitments include leases for three premises in the united states  located in san jose  santa clara and alviso  california  and one location in each of canada  china  india  japan  singapore  south korea and taiwan 
in addition we have obligations under operating leases for equipment 
the aggregate minimum annual payments required under our lease obligations  excluding expected sub lease income  by fiscal year are as follows  in thousands of dollars payments due by fiscal year total operating leases our lease agreements expire at various dates through calendar purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw material and other goods and services have not been separately disclosed 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders for manufacturing are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
further information on lease obligations and commitments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
capital commitments we do not have any capital commitments that will have a material future effect on our financial condition 
subsequent event on june   our board of directors approved the executive bonus plan fiscal  a copy of which is filed hereto as exhibit the bonus plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we carry out a significant portion of our operations outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india and to a lesser extent china  europe  japan  south korea  singapore and taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we may  in the future  undertake hedging or other such transactions  if we determine that it is necessary to offset exchange rate risks 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   march   and march   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar relative to a pool of our foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition 
however  we do have canadian dollar denominated tax attributes represented by a deferred income tax asset on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
a near term appreciation in the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would increase our income tax expense by approximately million
