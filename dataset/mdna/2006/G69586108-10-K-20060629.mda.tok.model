item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading supplier of precision engineered packaging products for the storage  transportation and automated handling of semiconductor devices and other electronic components 
our products are designed to interface with automated handling equipment used in the production and testing of semiconductor and electronic products 
we produce principally matrix and disk drive trays  carrier tapes and reels 
we also produce leadframe boxes and interleaves used in the storage and transportation of leadframes 
in addition  we collect and sell recycled matrix trays 
we primarily derive our revenue from the sale of these products 
the following information is based on  and should be read with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased slightly to million in fiscal  reflecting certain improvements on the demand in the semiconductor industry from fiscal to fiscal and the cessation of manufacturing  marketing and selling tube products resulting in decline of consolidated sales from fiscal to fiscal our consolidated net loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to increased raw material costs caused by higher petroleum prices in fiscal  an impairment charge of million associated with a write down of plant  machinery and equipment used in our tape and reel businesses  a loss of million related to the disposal and write off of fixed assets  an inventory reserve of million for recycled material that could not be economically utilized  million of inventory reserve mainly for tubes  tapes and reels due to pricing trends and million of expenses related to discrepancies in the computation and payment of taxes and social insurance contributions for workers at the factory that manufactures our products  which is located in shenzhen  the prc and operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated prc company 
also included in the net loss for the fiscal was a million expense related to labor litigation in the factory in the prc 
our consolidated net loss decreased to million in fiscal in fiscal  we successfully utilized approximately million of materials  the cost of which had been recognized in a prior period primarily due to a lower of cost or market adjustment and had a favorable disposition through the sales of inventory that was previously reserved by approximately million as a result of improved pricing trends of reel and tape 
the favorable impact of these factors was offset by scrap materials write off of about million 
we also paid million of income taxes for certain former employees of peak  its affiliates or other companies who performed services at the factory  related tax advisory fees and other taxes  as well as customs duty 
in addition  higher materials usage and labor costs as a result of changes in product mix  raw material prices and labor overtime resulted in an adverse impact for fiscal the gross profit was also adversely impacted by million of severance payments to a group of terminated workers at the factory as a result of outsourcing of the canteen and security services 
a cost saving of selling and marketing expenses of million resulted mainly from reorganizing the sales offices and logistics management 
severance payments of million to the former chief executive officer and the former vice president  general counsel  were recorded in general administrative expenses for year ended march  a net gain on disposal of a subsidiary that held title to our asset held for disposal  of million was recorded in fiscal critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and title to the product has transferred to the customer 
title of the product may transfer to the end customer or distributor when shipped to or received by the customer based on the specific purchase terms of the agreement 
we evaluate the provision for estimated returns monthly  based on historical sales and returns 
to date we have not experienced significant returns 
any increase in the level of returns could have a material and adverse effect on our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is made against accounts receivable to the extent they are considered to be doubtful 
accounts receivable in the balance sheet are stated net of such provision 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
a provision is also made based on the aging of the receivables 
if circumstances change  such as the incurrence of higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change occurs regarding a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
at each balance sheet date  inventory on hand in excess of one year s demand or usage or those that were produced more than twelve months ago  are fully reserved for a net carrying value of zero 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated future cash flows  undiscounted  are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
asset to be disposed of by sale asset to be disposed of by sale represents the incomplete industrial building in shenzhen  the prc  together with the land use rights on which the building is built and is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of the balance sheet date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
fair value was calculated on the basis of a professional valuation report on the property provided by an independent appraiser 
a subsidiary that held title to the asset to be disposed of by sale  was sold for  in cash with a net gain of  during fiscal year see note deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more unlikely than likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
any change in the future recoverability of the deferred tax assets could significantly affect the results of our operations or cash flows 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
gains or losses on disposals are reflected in current operations 
major expenditures for betterments and renewals are capitalized 
all ordinary repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of property  plant and equipment adopted for depreciation purposes are as follows buildings years plant  machinery and equipment years molds years leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and motor vehicles years results of operations cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold primarily consists of costs of raw materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
operating expenses 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consists of freight and delivery costs  salaries and allowances 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and allowances and legal  professional and consulting fees 
research and development expenses primarily consist of wages  raw material costs and fixed assets depreciation 
the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain of our income statement items as a percentage of net sales 
year ended march  net sales cost of goods sold operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development gain on disposal of a subsidiary loss from operations other expense income  net interest income  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
revenues decreased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue from sales of our ic trays increased by 
volume for ic trays decreased by while average selling price increased by 
revenue from sales of our disk drive trays increased by driven mainly by an increase in average selling price by while volume decreased by 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to last year primarily due to an increase in average selling price of while a volume decreased by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our reel products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of while average selling price increased by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our cover tape products increased by reflecting both a increase in volume and a increase in the average selling price 
revenue from sales of our tube products decreased by comparing to the fiscal as we had ceased to manufacture  market and sell tube products since march due to unfavorable margins 
revenue from sale of our disc caddies increased to million for fiscal from only  for fiscal when this new product was first introduced 
our disk drive tray sales and new product sales have generally been to a few major customers or to subcontractors supporting those customers 
these sales are largely dependent on the introduction of new products by those customers 
new product introductions are difficult to forecast both with respect to timing as well as demand 
we have been producing new custom molds for those customers in anticipation of several new products  but these activities have not yet led to significant production orders 
mature products  while requiring some replacement trays  do not generally generate a sustainable high level of revenue 
as a result  revenue from sales of our disk drive trays and new products has  and will in the future  fluctuate dramatically with the corresponding fluctuations in the introduction of new products 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase by 
gross margin increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal improvements in gross profit and gross margin percentage were attributable to several factors 
first  we exited the unprofitable manufacture  marketing and sales of tube products at the end of fiscal second  improved market pricing trends have allowed us to increase the average selling prices of our products  and there was a favorable impact of about million arising from the sales of inventory that had previously been reserved 
third  we had improved our material utilization 
we have successfully utilized approximately million of materials  the cost of which had been recognized in a prior period 
the above favorable impact was partially offset by scrap materials written off that amounted to million in fiscal also  there was higher material cost as a result of changes in sales mix and material prices 
an amount of million was incurred as severance payments to a group of terminated workers at the factory in shenzhen the factory for fiscal as a result of outsourcing the canteen and security functions at the factory that is operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated party 
an amount of million was incurred as severance payments for fiscal higher labor costs as a result of changes in product mix  and labor overtime also resulted in an adverse impact for fiscal our gross profit for fiscal was also impacted by accruals and payments in connection with the underpayment of taxes in the prc incurred by the factory 
in april  the prc tax authorities began an investigation into the withholding and payment of income taxes by the factory for certain current and former employees of the company  its affiliates or other companies who performed services at the factory but had not paid income taxes in the prc and for whom the factory did not withhold and pay income taxes 
the prc tax authorities sought to collect unpaid income taxes on salaries and expense allowances of certain current and former employees of the company  its affiliates or other companies who performed services in the prc based on the worker s relationship with the factory and interest and penalties on such amounts 
since some of these claims were based on income earned over several years  the amount of such taxes  accrued interest and penalties was substantial 
the company does not believe that it was liable for such claims  but in the event the prc tax authorities determine payments for back taxes  interest and penalties are owed  the potential consequences could have included substantial monetary claims against the factory or the seizure of the factory and the company s assets at the factory and the termination of substantially all of the company s production operations 
the prc authorities did assert claims for such taxes against the factory  and accordingly the company did make payments on a voluntary basis in order to avoid the seizure of the factory or the company s assets at the factory and to keep it operational 
the company engaged tax advisors to assist the company in assessing the factory s and the company s obligations with respect to the withholding and payment of income and other taxes by the factory 
the investigation concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal a total of approximately million was paid in fiscal for the income taxes of certain former employees stationed at or employed by the factory  and for other taxes 
the company did not believe that the factory had sufficient assets to pay such amounts 
upon final settlement of this prc tax investigation there were no interest or penalty assessments on the above unpaid income taxes 
an additional million has been paid as fees to the china tax advisor 
loss from operations 
an operating loss of million was recorded for fiscal compared to a loss of million recorded for fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of cost savings from reorganizing our logistics management and sales offices 
during fiscal  we consolidated certain of our sales and distribution facilities in singapore  malaysia and china 
this consolidation contributed to the decrease in selling and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal mainly  as a result of severance payments of million to the former chief executive officer and the former vice president  general counsel  as well as an increase in costs associated with the use of consultants to review and improve various operational efficiencies at the factory 
gain on disposal of a subsidiary 
we realized a net gain on the sale of a subsidiary  warden development ltd 
warden  which held title to an incomplete industrial building and the associated land use rights  located approximately three miles from our existing prc production facilities  of approximately million in fiscal the incomplete industrial building was originally purchased with the intention of completing the facility for expansion of our existing production facilities but this plan was subsequently aborted 
the sale was completed on april   with full ownership of warden and its associated risk transferred to the purchaser  for sales proceeds of approximately million in cash 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net is comprised of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
fluctuations are due primarily to the relative strength or weaken of the us dollar at various times compared with the other currencies we use to conduct our business 
interest income  net 
interest income  net increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in interest rates for such deposits 
net loss 
net loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting all the above factors 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
revenues increased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from greater demand across all products  except for disk drive trays 
revenue from sales of our ic trays increased by 
volume for ic trays increased by while average selling price dropped by 
the increase in volume for ic trays was primarily due to increased demand for such trays 
revenue from sales of our disk drive trays decreased by driven mainly by a drop in average selling price by while volume increased by 
revenue from sales of our carrier tape products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of while average selling price dropped by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our reel products increased by compared to last year primarily due to a volume increase of while average selling price dropped by compared to the prior year 
revenue from sales of our cover tape products increased by reflecting both a increase in volume and a increase in the average selling price 
revenue from sales of our tube products increased by reflecting both increase in volume and increase in an average selling price 
our disk drive tray sales have generally been to one major customer or to subcontractors supporting that customer 
these sales are largely dependent on the introduction of new products by that customer 
new product introductions are difficult to forecast both with respect to timing as well as demand 
we have been producing new custom molds for that customer in anticipation of several new products  but this activity has not yet led to significant production orders 
mature products  while requiring some replacement trays  do not generally generate a sustainable high level of revenue 
as a result  revenue from sales of our disk drive trays has  and will in the future  fluctuate dramatically with the corresponding fluctuations in the introduction of new products 
during the quarter ended december   we announced to our customers our intention to discontinue the production and sale of tubes and in march we ceased the manufacture  marketing and sale of tube products 
we gave our customers until the end of march to place orders for last time buys 
we accelerated depreciation on the dedicated equipment used in the manufacturing of tubes and as a result all such assets had a zero book value at the time of disposal 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  a decrease 
gross margin deteriorated to in fiscal from in fiscal  reflecting a reduction in the average selling price of our products and an increase in the cost of raw material due to higher petroleum prices 
the gross profit for fiscal also included an impairment charge of million associated with a write down of plant  machinery and equipment used in our tape and reel businesses  a million loss related to the disposal and write off of fixed assets  an inventory reserve of million for recycled material that could not be economically utilized  million of inventory reserve mainly for tubes  tapes and reels due to pricing trends and million of expenses related to discrepancies in the computation and payment of taxes and social insurance contributions for workers at the factory 
the discrepancy  which was at the factory and not at peak  was discovered as a result of a claim by an employee regarding the computation of wages and withholding 
upon discovery of these discrepancies  we conducted an internal review of the factory s practices and engaged third party advisors to assist us in assessing the factory s and our obligations with respect to these discrepancies 
upon completion of this review in the third quarter of fiscal  management concluded that the factory had a duty to correct certain of these discrepancies that amounted to a total of million 
while we believe we were not contractually obligated under the terms of our agreement with our processing partner to pay these amounts and while no claim had yet been made by any government agency  we voluntarily made payments of approximately million to the prc tax authorities in the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to avoid the seizure of the factory s assets and keep it operational 
also included in the gross profit for the year was a million expense related to labor litigation in the factory in the prc 
loss from operations 
an operating loss of million was recorded for fiscal compared to a loss of million recorded for fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses remained steady at million in both fiscal and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained steady at million in both fiscal and other expense income  net 
other expense income  net is generally comprised of foreign currency gains and losses as a result of a fluctuation of the us dollar at certain times during the year 
other income  net decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in fiscal   was collected in partial payment of a judgment against a former officer of the company which was included in other income expense  net 
interest income  net 
interest income  net increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to the increase in bank deposit balances and increase in interest rates for such deposits 
net loss 
net loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting all the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources we historically met a significant portion of our cash requirements from cash flow from operations and we expect this to continue in fiscal in fiscal  we did not have any cash generated from nor used in financing activities 
our primary uses of cash have been to fund capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities and operations and working capital requirements 
we intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business operations and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of march  our net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to a net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and a net cash provision of million in fiscal the increase in cash used in operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a deposit of approximately million into an escrow to fund certain contingent obligations under existing contracts with senior management 
during fiscal  we paid severance payments of million to the former chief executive officer and the former vice president  general counsel  out of this escrow fund 
the increase in cash used in operating activities was also due to million cash used in accounts payable trade 
in fiscal year  we received million as an advance deposit in connection with the sale of warden  the subsidiary that held title to the incomplete industrial building and related land use rights 
our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million for the acquisition of new equipment in our current production facilities during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the continuous investment in capital expenditure during fiscal and reflected capacity expansion due to the increase in economic activity in the semiconductor industry and replacement of obsolete fixed assets 
in fiscal year  we have also received million as cash proceeds from the disposal of warden 
the remaining million of the sales consideration was kept in escrow that will be released to us in two equal payments during the first quarters of fiscal and for details of the escrow  see note as of march   we had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures may vary substantially from those budgeted or estimated for a variety of reasons  including changes in market conditions  unavailability or changes in scheduled delivery of specific equipment  changes in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand capacity and replace our obsolete fixed assets in future periods and plan to fund such expansion through our current cash reserves  future cash flow from operations and new bank borrowings as required 
we lease office and warehouse facilities under various leases that expire through total future minimum commitments under these leases amount to approximately million 
as of march   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
at march   the company has unsecured letter of credit facilities available of million of which all have been utilized 
interest rates in connection with the credit facilities are generally based on the weighted average lending rates of and the line of credit is normally subject of annual review 
according to customs rules in the prc  it is possible that we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we would have to pay if we were importing material for ultimate sale in the prc 
if the customs authorities of the prc require us to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales  and exported products  we will experience a substantial additional use our cash resources 
there was no cash provided by financing activities in fiscal  compared to a cash provided of million in fiscal and a net cash usage of million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was due to proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to million worth of our common stock at prices not to exceed of our net asset value per share 
common stock repurchased was cancelled immediately 
during the year ended march   we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average cost of per share 
there were no repurchases of shares for years ended march  and as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell additional equity securities  publicly or privately in the amounts that may be needed or at all 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in the amounts that may be needed  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
additional equity or debt financing may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor does it use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  the company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
from time to time  we may evaluate possible investments or acquisitions and may  if a suitable opportunity arises  make such an investment or acquisition 
we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march   our future fixed commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase orders pvc compound price pvc compound  the principal material used in the manufacture of our tubes  accounted for and of our total raw materials costs in fiscal and respectively 
in fiscal  we ceased the manufacture  marketing and sale of tube products and hence minimal pvc compound was used 
hong kong profits tax the factory at which our products are produced  which is located in shenzhen  the prc  is operated pursuant to a processing agreement with an unaffiliated prc company 
according to the tax guidelines issued by the tax authority in a situation where a hong kong company manufactures goods partly in hong kong and partly outside hong kong  the hong kong inland revenue department ird may accept profits that relate to the manufacture of the goods outside hong kong to be offshore in nature and therefore not subject to hong kong profits tax 
the offshore claim would only be allowed by the ird by way of concession and provided that certain criteria are met to their satisfaction 
we believed that most of its manufacturing activities were conducted outside hong kong and therefore since fiscal it apportioned a substantial amount of its profits to to activities outside hong kong for tax filing purposes 
however  since fiscal  there was a dispute with the ird in relation to the apportionment basis of the profit derived from manufacturing activities outside hong kong 
we raised a number of objections to the tax assessments and examined factors that the ird used to ascertain the geographic nature of our activities and sources of the profits 
we made provisions for taxes payable according to the apportionment basis based on practices normally acceptable by the ird in general cases 
interest associated with the tax payable for fiscal years to had also been accrued 
we believed that the aggregate maximum amount of its potential exposure was approximately million plus interest in the amount of million 
as a result  the company accrued million as of march  and million as of march  as part of the income taxes payable 
in connection with the above  the ird requested that we place tax reserve certificates of million with ird as of march  and million and letters of credit of million with the ird as of march   which could be recovered if we prevails 
in the year ended march   we reached a settlement with the ird and these tax reserve certificates were utilized to pay for the prior year taxes 
a net gain of million was recognized as a result of the settlement with the ird 
new accounting standards in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
fas no 

fas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principles 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
this statement also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the company believes this has no material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  or statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
or opinion generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in the unrevised statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date of statement r so that companies may now adopt its provisions at the beginning of their first annual period beginning after june  which would be fiscal  beginning april  for us 
as permitted by the unrevised statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method  under which we generally do not record compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   which would be our second quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   which would be our first quarter of fiscal and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our cost of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  new taiwanese dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars  renminbi  japanese yen and the euro 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
at march  and  we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which would have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
as the hong kong dollar is officially pegged to the us dollar and the renminbi is controlled by the prc government such that it only trades within a limited range against the us dollar  unless there are significant changes in the policies of the hong kong and the prc government  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar and the renminbi are not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
however  should the prc government allow the renminbi to have a wider trading range  resulting in a significant appreciation of the renminbi against the us dollar  our production costs will increase and our operating margins will erode
