executive level overview the company s financial results are dependent on the following areas of the income statement net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense and provision for income taxes 
net interest income is the primary earnings of the company and the main focus of management 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and investment securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
deposits and borrowings have short durations and the cost of these funds do not rise and fall in tandem with earnings on loans and investment securities 
there are many risks involved in managing net interest income including  but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk and duration risk 
these risks have a direct impact on the level of net interest income 
the company manages these risks through credit review by an outside firm and regular meetings of its asset and liability management committee alco 
the credit review process reviews loans for underwriting and grading of loan quality while alco reviews liquidity  interest rate risk and capital resources 
loan quality has a direct impact on the amount of provisions for loan losses the company reports 
non interest income has a direct impact on earnings of the company 
maintenance of customers accounts for loans and deposits generates fee income depending on the product selected 
the company generates gains on sales of mortgage loans and receives fee income from servicing loans sold 
non interest income is primarily impacted by the volume of customers transactions which could change in response to interest rates  pricing and competition 
non interest expenses include various expenses of the company which are controlled by a budget process 
in and  management determined that net interest income would experience some compression due to lower interest rates and implemented various expense reduction programs to help offset the reduction in net interest income 
provisions for income taxes are directly related to earnings or implemented tax strategies of the company 
changes in the statutory tax rates and the earnings of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries would affect the amount of income taxes reported 
there are areas in the consolidated financial statements where significant estimates or assumptions are used 
these include the provision and allowance for loan losses  the provision for estimated taxes  and the impairment of investment securities 
management monitors the application of the company s critical accounting policies in relation to the nature and impact of these estimates and assumptions on earnings 
the critical accounting policies are discussed below 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  income taxes and impairment of securities 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from managements estimates and assumptions using different conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows 
table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance balance reflects management s assessment of losses and is based on a review of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the company considers many factors in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
collateral value on a loan by loan basis  trends of loan delinquencies on a portfolio segment level  risk classification identified in the company s regular review of individual loans  and economic conditions are primary factors in establishing the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses reflects all information available at the end of the year 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses  which are a charge to the income statement  and by recoveries on loans previously charged off 
the allowance is reduced by loans charged off and by negative credit provisions to the allowance 
for a further discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on establishing the allowance for loan losses 
income taxes operating losses in the early s resulted in available tax loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the potential deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income in the carry forward period 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax valuation allowances are established and based on management s judgment as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the future tax benefits of prior operating losses will be realized 
it should be noted  however  that factors beyond management s control  such as the general state of the economy and real estate values  can affect future levels of taxable income and that no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences 
for a further discussion on income taxes  see results of operations income taxes  below and see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment securities the measurement of the impairment of the securities portfolio requires an evaluation process that considers both the historical and current financial performance and environment of the security  credit worthiness of the issuer  and potential recovery measures of each impaired investment 
management periodically reviews all securities to identify those that show signs of impairment 
once identified  these securities are monitored and evaluated based upon the above considerations and if the decline in fair value is below the cost basis of an investment and is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis is written down to the current fair value and the amount of the write down is included in the results of operations 
for a further discussion on investment securities  see financial conditional of investment securities  below and see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition overview total assets increased to million at december  up from million at december  the increase in asset size is mainly attributable to an increase of million in cash and due from banks  million in fhlb stock and million in loan growth

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses which is a charge to operations 
the allowance balance reflects management s assessment of losses and is based on a review of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the company considers many factors in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
collateral value on a loan by loan basis  trends of loan delinquencies on a portfolio segment level  risk classification identified in the company s regular review of individual loans  and economic conditions are primary factors in establishing the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses reflects all information available at the end of each year 
the company considers the current year end level of the allowance for loan losses to be appropriate and adequate 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at both december  and december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans are commercial and commercial real estate loans for which it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are not the same as non accrual loans  although the two categories overlap 
non accrual loans include impaired loans and are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest has become contractually past due days 
the company may choose to place a loan on non accrual status due to payment delinquency or the uncertainty of collectibility  while not classifying the loan as impaired  if i it is probable that the company will collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or ii the loan is not a commercial or commercial real estate loan 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value 
the amount of impairment is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan  using the original contractual interest rate  and its recorded value  or  as a practical expedient in the case of collateral dependent loans  the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loan 
when foreclosure is probable  impairment is based on the fair value of the collateral 
the company maintained a low level of risk assets and had minimal delinquencies during the year as a result  there was no charge to the provision for loan losses in the year or during  the bank recognized  of the interim distribution from a prior year legal judgment  see item  legal proceedings  as a recovery to the allowance for loan losses on amounts previously charged off 
in conjunction with this  the bank also recorded a credit negative provision for loan losses of  the company had net charge offs of  in and net recoveries of  in the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year charge offs by loan type residential mortgage commercial commercial real estate consumer total charge offs recoveries by loan type residential mortgage commercial commercial real estate consumer total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision credit for loan losses ending balance ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding during the period the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the years ended december

all loans classified as substandard or doubtful are evaluated for collectibility and an allocation is made based on an assessment of the net realizable value of any collateral 
the company categorizes each commercial loan into different pools of risk 
each risk level allocation factor has been determined based upon the company s review of common practices within the industry  its estimate of expected loss for loans with similar credit characteristics based upon historical loss experience  together with the company s assessment of economic conditions and other relevant factors that may have an impact on or may affect repayment of loans in these pools 
residential mortgages  home equity loans  equity lines of credit  second mortgages and all other small consumer loans are considered in the aggregate and an allocation factor is assessed based upon the company s historical loss experience together with an assessment of future economic trends  conditions and other relevant factors that may have an impact on repayment of the loans in these pools 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates all allocation factors for appropriateness  considering i significant changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  ii the company s assessment of local and national economic business conditions  and iii any other relevant factor that it considers may have an impact on loan portfolio risk 
based upon these evaluations  changes to the reserve provision may be made to maintain the overall level of the reserve at a level that the company deems appropriate and adequate to cover the estimated credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio including unfunded binding commitments to lend 
potential problem loans the company has a loan review and grading system 
during the loan review process  deteriorating conditions of certain loans are identified in which erosion of the borrower s ability to comply with the original terms of the loan agreement could potentially result in the future classification of the loan as a risk asset 
this may result from deteriorating conditions such as cash flows  collateral values or creditworthiness of the borrower 
there were no potential problem loans identified at december  or december  
table of contents risk assets risk assets consist of non performing loans  oreo  and restructured loans 
the following paragraphs define each of these categories

recent accounting developments in march  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to determine the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities within the scope of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the task force concluded that an investment is impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than cost 
if impaired  the investor must make an evidence based judgment to determine if the impairment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time considering the severity and duration of the impairment in relation to the forecasted recovery of fair value 
the impairment should be considered other than temporary if the investor does not have the ability and intent to hold an investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment 
for those investments for which impairment is considered other than temporary  the company would recognize in earnings an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
eitf no 
other than temporary impairment evaluations were effective fore reporting periods beginning after september  in september  the fasb issued fsp fasb staff position eitf issue  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issued no 
due to industry responses to eitf no 
the fsp provided guidance for the application of eitf no 
as it relates to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases non credit impairment 
it also delayed the effective date of eitf no 
for non credit impaired debt securities until a final consensus could be reached 
in november  the fasb took the staff s recommendation to nullify the guidance of paragraphs of eitf on the determination of whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and issued fsp fas  meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which will replace certain guidance set forth in paragraphs of eitf issue no 
and clarify that for non credit impaired debt securities  other than temporary impairment can generally be avoided if the investor has the ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery of fair value or maturity 
fsp fas will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
statement of position sop accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued sop sop requires that when loans are acquired through a transfer  such as a business combination  and there are differences in expected cash flows and contractual cash flows due in part to credit quality  such differences be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
valuation allowances can not be created nor carried over in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer of loans with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination 
however  valuation allowances for non impaired loans acquired in a business combination can be carried over 
this sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
the company s adoption of sop in did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the company s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and by such reaction reduce the impact of inflation on asset quality and performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide net interest income fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  under the headings investment securities  loans  and interest rate sensitivity respectively for an understanding of the company s approach to changing prices and inflation trends  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and security portfolios and the data on the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management managing interest rate risk is fundamental to banking 
the company has continued to manage its liquidity  capital  and gap position so as to control its exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december   the company had interest rate sensitive assets which repriced or matured within one year of million and interest rate sensitive liabilities which repriced or matured within one year of million 
as of december   the company had interest rate sensitive assets which matured or repriced within one year of million and interest rate sensitive liabilities which repriced or matured within one year of million 
interest rate sensitivity the company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position 
the objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve a stable and rising flow of net interest income 
the alco  using policies approved by the board of directors  is responsible for managing the bank s rate sensitivity position 
the asset liability management policy establishes guidelines for acceptable exposure to interest rate risk  liquidity  and capital 
the objective of alco is to manage earning assets and liabilities to produce results which are consistent with the company s policy for net interest income  liquidity and capital and identify acceptable levels of growth  risk and profitability 
alco establishes and monitors origination and pricing strategies consistent with alco policy 
alco meets regularly to review the current economic environment  income simulation model and gap analysis and implements appropriate changes in strategy that will manage the company s exposure to interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
alco manages the company s interest rate risk using both income simulation and gap analysis 
income simulation is used to quantify interest rate risk inherent in the company s consolidated balance sheet by showing the effect of a change in net interest income over a month period 
the income simulation model uses parallel interest rate shocks of up basis points bp or down basis points bp for earning assets and liabilities in the first year of the model 
interest rates are not shocked in the second year of the model 
the composition of the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  remains relatively well matched over the month horizon with a slight bias towards liability sensitivity in the first year 
the simulation takes into account the dates for repricing  maturing  prepaying and call options assumptions of various financial categories which may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
prepayment speeds are estimates for the loans and are adjusted according to the degree of rate changes 
call options and prepayment speeds for investment securities are estimates using industry standards for pricing and prepayment assumptions 
the assumptions of financial instrument categories are reviewed before each simulation by alco in light of current economic trends 
as of december   the income simulation model indicated some negative exposure of net interest income to rising interest rates to a degree that remains within tolerance levels established by the company s policy 
the interest rate scenario used does not necessarily reflect alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the model s period 
furthermore  the model assumes a static consolidated balance sheet 
these results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the company for the same periods 

table of contents the following table summarizes the net interest income for the month period of the company s consolidated balance sheet for earning assets and liabilities for the years ended december net interest income simulation model results interest rate shock down up flat rates bp bp dollars in thousands year one year two total net interest income for year period interest rate shock down up flat rates bp bp dollars in thousands year one year two total net interest income for year period the income simulation model reflects negative exposure to net interest income in a rising interest rate environment from flat rates to up bp  which would result from shorter liabilities due to short term borrowings from fhlb 
margins would narrow as deposits and borrowings are faster to reprice to higher interest rates 
the company s primary measure of interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap measurement attempts to analyze any mismatches in the timing of interest rate repricing between assets and liabilities 
it identifies those balance sheet sensitivity areas which are vulnerable to unfavorable interest rate movements 
as a tool of asset liability management  the gap position is compared with potential changes in interest rate levels in an attempt to measure the favorable and unfavorable effect such changes would have on net interest income 
for example  when the gap is positive  ie  assets reprice faster than liabilities a rise in interest rates will increase net interest income  and  conversely  if the gap is negative  a rise in interest rates will decrease net interest income 
the accuracy of this measure is limited by unpredictable loan prepayments and the lags in the interest rate indices used for repricing variable rate loans or investment securities 
the company s one year cumulative gap to total assets decreased from less than at december   to less than at december  the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity gap position as of december  the table excludes non performing loans and assumes that all deposits except savings and nows will be withdrawn within the legal time period for withdrawal 
this withdrawal of deposit assumption is not likely to occur
