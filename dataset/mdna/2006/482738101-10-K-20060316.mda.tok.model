introduction we develop  manufacture and market mobile communications products for the land and marine markets and navigation  guidance and stabilization products for defense and commercial markets 
our expertise in mobile satellite antenna  digital compass and fiber optic gyro technologies has enabled us to lower the cost  decrease the size and improve the performance of our products 
our research and development  manufacturing and quality control capabilities have enabled us to meet the demanding standards of our military  consumer and commercial customers for performance and reliability 
this combination of factors has allowed us to increase our penetration of existing markets and enter new markets 
we are a leading provider of mobile communications products  such as our tracvision  tracphone and tracnet systems  that enable customers to receive live digital television  telephone and internet services in their automobiles  recreational vehicles and marine vessels while in motion via satellite and wireless services 
we sell our mobile communications products through an extensive international network of retailers  distributors and dealers 
in january  we announced an agreement with microsoft to bring high speed internet access and msn tv service to cars  boats  and recreational vehicles  thereby expanding our ability to support mobile internet and supplement our existing mobile satellite product lines 
our defense products include tactical navigation systems that provide uninterrupted navigation and pointing information in a broad range of military vehicles  including tactical trucks hmmwvs and light armored vehicles 
we also offer precision fiber optic gyro based systems that help stabilize platforms  such as gun turrets and radar units  and provide guidance for munitions 
we sell our defense products directly to us and allied governments and government contractors  as well as through an international network of authorized independent sales representatives 
our fiber optic products are also used in such commercial applications as train track geometry measurement systems  industrial robotics  optical stabilization  autonomous vehicles  and undersea remotely operated submersibles 
our solutions mobile communications we believe that there is an increasing demand for mobile access to live media and information on the move 
our objective is to connect mobile users to the satellite tv  communications  and internet services they wish to 
table of contents use by utilizing the best available and most appropriate data sources  such as satellite broadcasts or wireless service 
we have developed a comprehensive family of products marketed under the tracvision  tracphone and tracnet brand names that use a range of technologies to address the unique needs of our communications markets 
our products use sophisticated robotics  stabilization and control software  sensing technologies  volt integration  and advanced antenna designs to offer the following benefits consistent and reliable mobile satellite communications 
our mobile satellite communications products can automatically search for  identify and point directly at the satellite  whether a vehicle or vessel is in motion or stationary 
our antennas use gyros and inclinometers to measure the pitch  roll and yaw of an antenna platform in relation to the earth 
microprocessors and our proprietary stabilization and control software use that data to compute the antenna movement necessary for the antenna s motors to point the antenna properly and maintain contact with the satellite 
if an obstruction temporarily blocks the satellite signal  our products continue to track the satellite s location according to the movement of the antenna in order to carry out automatic  rapid reacquisition of the signal when a direct line of sight to the satellite is restored 
wide range of products for the mobile user 
we provide mobile satellite communications products for a variety of vehicles in the land mobile market  which includes luxury motor coaches  buses  recreational vehicles  trucks  and automobiles  as well as a variety of vessels in the marine market  which includes commercial shipping vessels  commercial fishing vessels  merchant ships  and yachts 
we developed our earliest products for the luxury yacht market and have succeeded in reducing the size and cost of our products for introduction into the land market 
initially we focused on larger vehicles like motor coaches  but we subsequently added support for passenger vehicles 
our tracvision a brings satellite television to automobiles using a patented  low profile antenna system that currently provides in motion satellite television in most of the continental united states using the directv service 
our entry into the automotive arena was facilitated by our hybrid phased array antenna technology 
we are currently investigating opportunities to transfer our commercial mobile satellite antenna technology into military applications  including small  affordable  high bandwidth antennas suitable for military vehicles 
access to mobile  two way internet  e mail  and msn tv communication 
we currently support global broadband internet access in the marine marketplace through the use of our tracphone satellite communication antennas and the inmarsat satellite services 
in january we announced our intention to bring to market by mid a mobile internet system suitable for cars  recreational vehicles  and boats in cooperation with microsoft s msn tv division 
the planned system will use evolution data optimized evdo high speed cellular data services to provide two way access to the internet and the msn tv service 
evdo is currently available in more than metropolitan areas and continues to expand 
should users be outside the evdo coverage area  a slower speed cellular service will continue to provide uninterrupted accessibility 
for recreational vehicles and marine vessels that may travel beyond the range of a typical evdo antenna  we anticipate offering external  amplified antennas to increase the reception range of the mobile internet system 
commitment to customer support 
our certified support network csn offers our tracvision  tracphone and tracnet customers an international network of skilled technical dealers and support centers in many locations where our customers are likely to travel 
we have selected distributors based on their technical expertise  professionalism and commitment to quality and regularly provide them with extensive training in the sale  installation and support of our products 
defense we offer a portfolio of digital compass and fiber optic gyro based systems that address the rigorous requirements of military customers for precision navigation  guidance and stabilization 
our systems offer reliable  continuously available navigation and guidance 
our systems provide an unjammable source of reliable  easy to use and continuously available navigation and pointing data 
for example  our tacnav system can tell a vehicle driver in which direction to steer to reach a certain target  how much farther to the destination  
table of contents and whether or not the vehicle is on course 
because our digital compass products measure the earth s magnetic field rather than detect satellite signals from the global positioning system gps  they are not susceptible to gps jamming devices 
our new fiber optic gyro based inertial measurement unit product  or imu  enhances the accuracy of guided underwater munitions 
this imu  along with our core fiber optic technology  also has potential commercial and industrial applications 
compatibility with a wide range of vehicles and platforms 
we offer variants of our tacnav system using both our fiber optic gyros and digital compasses  providing low cost  integrated tactical navigation solutions for military vehicles ranging from tactical trucks to combat vehicles 
tacnav systems address the varying operational requirements of different vehicles  such as turret pointing on a tank and vehicle navigation on a combat support vehicle 
we also offer several fiber optic gyro based products that support stabilization applications  such as stabilization of turrets  optical targeting systems  radar and communication antennas in both the military and commercial markets 
integration and aggregation of data from on board systems 
our navigation systems function as standalone tools and also aggregate  integrate and communicate critical information from a variety of on board systems 
tacnav can receive data from systems such as the vehicle s odometer  military and commercial gps devices  laser rangefinders  turret angle indicators and laser warning systems 
tacnav can also output this data to an on board computer for retransmission through the vehicle s communications systems to a digital battlefield management application 
we have also demonstrated to the us army an early prototype of a new tacnav system that successfully combined tacnav with satellite communication technology  potentially enabling tacnav to communicate directly with digital battlefield management applications 
our products we offer a broad array of products to address the needs of a variety of customers in the markets for mobile communications and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization 
mobile communications products our mobile communications products include our tracvision  tracphone and tracnet products  which offer satellite television and voice  fax  data and internet communications to customers in the land mobile and marine markets 
we began to offer both our first kvh branded mobile satellite communications product  the tracphone k  and our first mobile satellite tv antenna  the tracvision  in since that time  we have expanded our product offerings to include more than different mobile satellite communications products 
our mobile satellite communications antennas are housed in impact resistant domes to protect them from inclement weather or debris 
land 
we design  manufacture  and sell a range of tracvision satellite tv antenna systems for use on a broad array of vehicles 
our land satellite business comprises two principal vehicle classes and opportunities automotive and rv truck 
in the automotive market  we offer the tracvision a  which uses hybrid phased array antenna technology to provide in motion reception of satellite tv programming in the continental united states using the directv service 
our tracvision a product includes a mobile satellite communications antenna and a v receiver designed specifically for the automotive environment to convert the satellite signal into a video stream 
the tracvision a stands approximately five inches high and mounts either to a vehicle s roof rack or directly to the vehicle s roof  making it practical for use aboard minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
the antenna s hybrid phased array technology integrates small antenna elements across a flat surface  mechanically rotates that surface horizontally and uses an electronic lens to bend the satellite signal so that the broadcast energy strikes each of the individual elements at closer to a perpendicular angle 
the separate signals from each small antenna element are then combined to create a single data stream 
in january  directv introduced its total choice mobile satellite tv programming package for automotive applications 
at this time  we are 
table of contents the only company authorized by directv to sell  promote  and activate mobile users for the total choice mobile programming package 
in april  cadillac endorsed the tracvision a as a dealer installed accessory option for the cadillac escalade 
since that time  a limited number of cadillac dealers have elected to offer the tracvision a as an option during a new car purchase 
in the rv truck market  we offer a line up of our tracvision satellite tv products  including products intended for both stationary and in motion use 
in november  we announced the overhaul of our rv product line  phasing out our older analog systems in favor of the digital tracvision r series 
these antennas offer automatic satellite switching and integrated compatibility with the international dvb digital video broadcast standard at price points traditionally reserved for our older analog systems  which offered fewer features 
the inch high in motion tracvision r and stationary automatic tracvision r  which began shipping in december  use an elliptical parabolic antenna to reduce the antenna s profile to address height restrictions on the road 
the in motion tracvision r  which is expected to begin shipping in the spring of  will serve as the premier product of our rv specific offerings 
this new system is expected to incorporate a number of innovations  including a high efficiency antenna that is expected to reduce the product profile to inches high while offering reception comparable to the larger systems  integrated gps for faster satellite acquisition  and electronic dew elimination technology 
in addition to sales through aftermarket dealers  we sell our tracvision products to original equipment manufacturers for factory installation on new vehicles 
each of these systems works with a range of service providers  including directv  dish network  and other regional service providers 
although initially designed for automotive applications  the tracvision a is now also sold within the rv marketplace to provide access to directv programming in in motion applications and for vehicles with height restrictions that could prevent them from safely using a satellite tv antenna based on parabolic technology  and or where the accumulation of moisture on the outer surface of the antenna s radome is not a concern 
marine 
in the marine market  we offer a range of mobile satellite tv and communications products 
our marine tracvision satellite tv antennas vary in size from a lower profile elliptical parabolic system similar to those offered for use on rvs to   and inch diameter round antennas 
our largest marine satellite tv system is the tracvision g  which includes a inch carbon fiber antenna for greater range and efficiency 
in october  we introduced the tracvision m  the world s smallest stabilized marine satellite tv system 
historically  marine satellite tv use has generally been limited to vessels longer than feet due to the size of the antennas themselves 
however  with reception comparable to larger inch diameter antennas  our high efficiency tracvision m is designed for vessels to feet in length  which we believe is a largely untapped market opportunity 
the tracvision m system also includes an integrated volt marine receiver for directv service  and an rf remote control for convenient operation and flexibility in the choice of installation locations 
our tracphone products provide in motion access to global satellite communications offered by inmarsat  a satellite service provider that supports links for phone  fax and data communications as fast as kbps  or kilobits per second 
the tracphone f  f and f antennas use the new inmarsat fleet service to offer voice as well as high speed internet service  while our tracphone antenna offers lower cost voice and low speed data services via the inmarsat mini m service 
the tracphone f  f and f are manufactured by thrane thrane a s of denmark and distributed exclusively by us in north america under the kvh tracphone label and distributed in other markets on a non exclusive basis 
broadband internet and msn tv products 
in addition to the global internet access offered by our inmarsat compatible tracphone systems  we also manufacture internet specific products for boats  rvs  and automobiles 
our tracnet product provides mobile broadband internet access in europe  where internet via satellite is a relatively common method for internet service 
tracnet uses one of our tracvision antennas to receive broadband downloads of internet data and either a cellular or satellite system  such as one of our tracphone systems  as a return path 

table of contents in january  we announced an agreement with microsoft in which we will serve as a distributor of the msn tv service to the marine  rv  and automotive markets 
our planned tracnet mobile internet receiver with msn tv service is expected to provide in motion access to web browsing  microsoft windows media player  msn mail and msn messenger  digital photo viewing  msn video  and msn radio with two way connections made possible by broadband evdo cellular services 
evdo service is available in more than markets nationwide  with new markets being added on an ongoing basis 
connection speeds for evdo service are similar to residential dsl broadband service  with maximum speeds in excess of mbps and typical speeds of kbps to kbps 
when evdo is unavailable  the system will automatically switch to standard xrtt data service  which is available in most cellular coverage areas 
xrtt has a maximum upload and download speed of kbps  and typical speeds of kbps to kbps 
an amplified external antenna will be used to extend the range of the tracnet in marine and rv applications in which the vessel or vehicle may move beyond the range of the system s integrated antenna 
the tracnet will also include wifi output to provide internet connectivity to a wide range of wifi enabled products 
we intend to sell the tracnet through our existing network of marine  rv  and automotive dealers 
we anticipate that the product will be in production and available for retail sale by mid defense products our defense products include digital compasses for tactical navigation  fiber optic gyros for tactical navigation and stabilization and our recently introduced inertial measurement unit for precision guidance of torpedoes and unmanned aerial vehicles 
our tacnav digital compass products have been sold for use aboard us army  marine corps  and navy vehicles as well as to many allied countries  including australia  the united kingdom  canada  germany  italy  new zealand  saudi arabia  spain  sweden  taiwan  malaysia and switzerland 
we believe that we are among the leading manufacturers of such systems 
our standard tacnav products can be customized to our customers specifications 
at customer request  we offer training and other services on a time and materials basis 
our fiber optic gyro products use an all fiber design without moving parts  which provides precision  accuracy and durability 
fiber optic gyros can be used for precision tactical navigation systems for military vehicles for stabilizing antennas  radar  optical devices or turrets  and image stabilization and synchronization for shoulder or tripod mounted weapon simulators 
our fiber optic products also support a broad range of commercial and industrial applications 
tactical navigation 
the tacnav ii fiber gyro navigation system is a fiber optic gyro based navigation and pointing system designed to support a variety of vehicle and weapons platforms 
the system offers a compact design  continuous output of heading and pointing data  and a flexible architecture that allows it to function as either a stand alone navigation module or as the central component of an expanded  multifunctional navigation system 
tacnav tls is a digital compass based tactical navigation and targeting system designed for turreted vehicles  including reconnaissance vehicles  armored personnel carriers and light armored vehicles 
the system offers a range of capabilities  including gps backup and enhancement  vehicle position  hull and turret azimuth  navigation displays  and target location 
the tacnav m gmens  formerly tacnav light  is a digital compass based battlefield navigation system specifically designed for non turreted vehicles  such as hmmwvs and trucks 
we believe that customers purchase the tacnav m gmens in part because of its low cost relative to its performance 
in september  the tacnav m gmens was designated by the us special operations command as a standard product  and in november the german army gave the product a similar designation 
the tacnav m gmens offers a range of capabilities  including gps backup and enhancement  vehicle position  hull azimuth and navigation displays 
guidance and stabilization 
our tg inertial measurement unit  or imu  introduced in october  is a guidance system that provides precise measurement of motion and acceleration in three dimensions 
it uses a 
table of contents three axis configuration of our high performance dsp based fiber optic gyros integrated with three accelerometers 
we believe that this configuration provides outstanding performance  high reliability  low maintenance and easy system integration 
the tg imu is in full production as a component in the us navy s new mk lightweight torpedo and is suitable for use in other applications that involve flight control  orientation  instrumentation and navigation  such as unmanned aerial vehicles 
our open loop dsp and dsp fiber optic gyros provide tactical grade precision measurement of the rate and angle of a platform s turning motion for significantly less cost than competing closed loop gyros 
these products use digital signal processing  or dsp  technology to deliver performance superior to analog signal processing devices  which experience greater temperature sensitive drift and rotation errors 
applications for these products include inertial measurement units  integrated navigation systems  attitude heading reference systems  and stabilization of antenna  radar and optical equipment 
the dsp is slightly larger than a deck of cards 
high performance axis and axis configurations can be realized by integrating multiple dsp units 
currently  the dsp is used in an array of pointing and stabilization applications  including the us army s stabilized remotely operated weapon system  or srws 
two dsp gyros are installed in every srws turret and provide the image and gun stabilization necessary to ensure that the weapon remains aimed at its target 
the larger  militarized dsp uses the core dsp technology in both and axis configurations and is designed for use in high shock and highly dynamic environments  such as gun turret stabilization 
our fiber optic products are also used in numerous commercial applications  such as train location control and track geometry measurement systems  industrial robotics  optical stabilization  autonomous vehicles  and undersea remotely operated submersibles 
sales and marketing we sell our mobile satellite communications products through an international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational vehicles 
we currently market and sell the tracvision a in the continental united states through consumer electronic chain stores and a large number of retailers specializing in automotive electronics  as well as a variety of specialty distributors of automotive after market products and auto dealership expediters 
we intend to continue the consideration of opportunities to expand our distribution network to include additional retailers and distributors in the continental united states 
in april  cadillac endorsed the tracvision a as a dealer installed accessory option  and the system is now available as part of a new car purchase at participating dealers 
we are also pursuing arrangements with other automobile manufacturers to include our tracvision a product as optional or standard equipment on the vehicles they manufacture 
our european sales subsidiary located in denmark  kvh europe a s  coordinates our sales  marketing and support efforts for our mobile satellite communications products in europe  the middle east and africa 
we sell our defense products directly to us and allied governments and government contractors  as well as through an international network of authorized independent sales representatives 
this same network also sells our fiber optic products to commercial industrial entities 
backlog our backlog was approximately million on december   million on december   and million on december  backlog consists of orders evidenced by written agreements and specified delivery dates for customers who are acceptable credit risks 
military orders included in backlog are generally subject to cancellation for the convenience of the customer 
when orders are cancelled  we recover actual costs incurred through the date of cancellation and the costs resulting from termination 
individual orders for defense products are often large and may require procurement of specialized long lead components and allocation of manufacturing resources 
the 
table of contents complexity of planning and executing larger orders requires customers to order well in advance of the required delivery date  resulting in backlog 
backlog is not a meaningful indicator for predicting revenue in future periods 
commercial resellers for our mobile satellite communications products and legacy products do not carry extensive inventories and rely on us to ship products quickly 
generally due to the rapid delivery of our commercial products  our backlog for those products is not significant 
intellectual property our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we own more than us and foreign patents and have additional patent applications that are currently pending 
in january  we entered into a licensing agreement with litton systems  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of northrop grumman systems corporation  with respect to certain of its fiber optic gyroscope related patents 
we also register our trademarks in the united states and other key markets where we do business 
our patents and trademarks will expire at various dates between march  and june  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants  key employees and sales representatives  and maintain controls over access to and distribution of our technology  software and other proprietary information 
the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us 
we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
from time to time  we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technologies infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights  and we may face similar claims in the future 
a description of such claims initiated against us during and currently pending is found in this annual report under the heading item legal proceedings 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the attention of our management 
if any of our products is found to violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we may be required to re engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to re engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  which would prevent us from selling our products  and  in any case  could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing manufacturing operations for our mobile satellite communications and navigation products consist of light manufacture  final assembly and testing 
manufacturing operations for our fiber optic gyro products are more complex 
we produce specialized optical fiber  fiber optic components and sensing coils and combine them with components purchased from outside vendors for assembly into finished goods 
we own optical fiber drawing towers where we produce the specialized optical fiber that we use in all of our fiber optic products 
we manufacture our mobile satellite communications products at our headquarters in middletown  rhode island  and utilize a nearby leased facility for warehousing and distribution purposes 
we manufacture our navigation and fiber optic gyro products in a leased facility located in tinley park  illinois 
we contract with third parties for fabrication and assembly of printed circuit boards  injection molded plastic parts  machined metal components  connectors and housings 
we believe there are a number of acceptable vendors for the components we purchase 
we regularly evaluate both domestic and foreign suppliers for quality  dependability and cost effectiveness 
in some instances we utilize sole source suppliers to develop strategic 
table of contents relationships to enhance the quality of materials and save costs 
our manufacturing processes are controlled by an iso certified quality standards program 
competition we encounter significant competition in all of our markets  and we expect this competition to intensify in the future 
many of our primary competitors are well established companies and some have substantially greater financial  managerial  technical  marketing  operational and other resources than we do 
in the market for mobile satellite communications products  we compete with a variety of companies 
we believe the principal competitive factors in this market are product size  design  performance  reliability  and price 
in the recreational vehicle and truck space  we compete directly with king controls  motosat  tracstar systems  inc  and winegard company 
our tracvision a was the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
at this time  we are not aware of any competing products in full production and available for widespread sale 
we are aware of other companies that intend to compete with us  including raysat  winegard  sirius satellite radio  and certain other suppliers of automotive parts 
in the marine market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete with navisystem marine electronics systems srl  orbit satellite television radio network  king controls  tracstar  sea tel  inc  and raymarine 
in the marine market for telephone  fax  data and internet communications equipment and services  we compete with furuno electric co  ltd  globalstar lp  iridium satellite llc  japan radio company  nera asa and thrane thrane a s 
we will serve as a distributor of the msn tv service to the marine  automotive  and recreational vehicle markets and as such  plan to offer what we believe will be a unique mobile internet solution 
however  we anticipate that our tracnet mobile internet system with msn tv service will compete with such products as single user evdo cards for use with individual laptops  evdo wifi hubs such as those manufactured by kyocera  junxion  and top global  proposed wimax services in urban areas  and internet via satellite systems proposed by companies such as raysat 
foreign competition for our mobile satellite communications products has continued to intensify  most notably from companies based in south korea that seek to compete primarily on price 
we anticipate that this trend will continue 
in the defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets  we compete primarily with honeywell international inc  kearfott guidance navigation corporation  leica microsystems ag  northrop grumman corporation and smiths group plc 
we believe the principal competitive factors in these markets are performance  accuracy  features  reliability  durability and price 
research and development focused investments in research and development are critical to our future growth and competitive position in the marketplace 
our research and development efforts are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our core business strategy 
the industries in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and new product introductions and enhancements 
as a result  our success depends in part upon our ability  on a cost effective and timely basis  to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and meet customers operational and cost requirements 
our current research and development efforts include projects to achieve additional cost reductions in our products and the development of new products for our existing marine and land mobile communications markets  and navigation  guidance and stabilization application markets 
we also plan to make future investments to pursue the integration 
table of contents of satellite communications technology with our existing tacnav systems to enable them to send and receive navigation data directly to and from digital battlefield management or similar systems 
our research and development activities consist of projects funded by us  projects funded with the assistance of small business innovative research sbir grants  and customer funded contract research 
sbir projects are generally directed towards the discovery of specific information requested by the government research sponsor 
many of these grants have enhanced our technologies  resulting in new or improved product offerings 
our customer funded research efforts are made up of contracts with defense and oem customers  whose performance specifications are unique to their product applications 
defense and oem research often results in new product offerings 
we strive to be the first company to bring a new product to market  and we use our own funds to accelerate new product development efforts 
government regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to various laws governing the protection of the environment and our employees 
these laws and regulations are subject to change  and any such change may require us to improve our technologies  incur expenditures  or both  in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
we are subject to compliance with the us export administration regulations 
some of our products have military or strategic applications  and are on the munitions list of the us international traffic in arms regulations 
these products require an individual validated license to be exported to certain jurisdictions 
the length of time involved in the licensing process varies and can result in delays of the shipping of the products 
sales of our products to either the us government or its prime contractors are subject to the us federal acquisition regulations 
we are also subject to the laws and regulations of the various foreign jurisdictions in which we offer and sell our products  including those of the european union 
employees on december   we employed full time employees 
we also employ temporary or contract personnel  when necessary  to provide short term and or specialized support for production and other functional projects 
we believe our future success will depend upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business 
if any of these risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant  develops into an actual event  then our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we may not be profitable in the future 
we have a history of variable profitability from operations 
although we generated net income during  and in eight of the last twelve fiscal quarters  we incurred net losses of million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents shifts in our product sales mix toward our mobile satellite communications products may reduce our overall gross margins 
our mobile communications products have historically had lower product gross margins than our defense products 
during  sales of our defense products grew at a substantially higher rate than our overall sales growth 
however  during  sales of our defense products declined compared to if the current shift in the product sales mix of satellite communications and defense products were to reverse  we could return to lower gross margins in the future 
the market for our mobile satellite tv products for minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles is still new and emerging  and our business may not grow as we expect 
we began shipping the tracvision a in september it was the first commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna practical for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
accordingly  the market for this product remains new and emerging 
consumers may not respond favorably to live satellite tv in passenger vehicles  and the market may not accept the tracvision a in a widespread manner 
the relatively early stages of development of this market continues to make it difficult for us to predict customer demand accurately 
for example  although sales of the tracvision a have grown between and  the sales trend is below our original expectations 
we have previously experienced temporary issues related to our production process and availability of adequate component supply 
although we believe we have successfully addressed the issues that have arisen  similar issues or other latent defects in the tracvision a could adversely affect sales 
we believe the success of the tracvision a will depend upon consumers assessment of whether or not it meets their expectations for performance  quality  price and design 
for example  the tracvision a is designed for use on open roads in the continental united states where there is a clear view of the transmitting satellite in the southern sky 
among the factors that could affect the success of the tracvision a are the extent to which tracvision a gains the acceptance of the automotive oems  the performance  price and availability of competing or alternative products relative to the tracvision a  the extent to which customers perceive mobile satellite tv services as a luxury or a preferred convenience  difficulties or inconveniences associated with scheduling installation at the point of sale  our limited experience with marketing a product to the automotive market  which is substantially larger and more fragmented than our other markets  the extent to which customers prefer live tv over recorded media  customers willingness to pay monthly fees for satellite television service in automobiles  the adoption of laws or regulations that restrict or ban live television or other video technology in vehicles  poor performance arising from improper installation or installation of damaged equipment  and the extent to which increasing fuel prices may negatively affect consumer demand for suvs and other large passenger vehicles 
our effort to enter the oem market for embedded mobile satellite tv products may not be successful 
during  we announced that we intend to support factory installation of an embedded version of our tracvision a mobile satellite tv antenna for automobiles 
however  the timetable for potential oem acceptance of the embedded system is uncertain  and our efforts to enter this market may not be successful 
in particular  there is a wide range of vehicle roof designs  environmental requirements and performance standards that our new product will have to address  and we may encounter unanticipated difficulties in designing antennas 
table of contents that will satisfy all of the unique requirements of various vehicle configurations 
in addition  our success in entering this market will depend in part on the close cooperation of vehicle manufacturers  and we cannot be certain that we will obtain the necessary cooperation 
because different vehicles may require different designs  our manufacturing efficiency for these embedded antennas may be lower and we may generate lower margins than for the tracvision a the expenses we expect to incur in pursuing this market may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect that others will introduce competing mobile satellite tv antennas for automobiles 
when we began shipping our tracvision a in september  it was the only commercially available  low profile mobile satellite tv antenna for use on minivans  suvs and other passenger vehicles 
any advantage we may have had by being the first to market such a product may erode as others enter this market 
for example  raysat made an initial  limited shipment of a phased array satellite antenna for automobiles late in when or if it enters full production  it is expected to be sold exclusively though audiovox as an audiovox branded product 
winegard has also previously announced its intention to offer an in motion automotive satellite tv antenna 
in addition  sirius satellite radio announced in january that it intends to introduce in a service offering several streaming video channels through sirius existing satellite radio system 
in january  delphi corp  a prominent supplier of automotive parts  announced a new agreement with comcast corporation to work together to develop ways to allow users to select video content and transfer it to an in vehicle entertainment system 
no details were provided as to the time frame for a possible product 
competing satellite antenna products may have a slightly lower profile and customers may delay purchasing the tracvision a in anticipation of the release of any of these products 
competition from any of these products could impair our ability to sell the tracvision a and may force us to reduce the price of the tracvision a moreover  delphi s long term relationships with automobile manufacturers may give it a significant advantage in selling mobile satellite tv antennas to those manufacturers 
we must achieve additional significant cost reductions for the tracvision a to reach our targeted profit margins 
our product profit margins for the tracvision a have been low since its introduction 
to reach our targeted profit margins  we must continue to significantly reduce our manufacturing costs for the tracvision a although we have had success in improving profit margins since the introduction of the tracvision a in september  we may be unable to achieve the additional cost reductions necessary to achieve our overall target profit margins 
although we have cost reduction programs in place that include obtaining volume purchasing discounts and redesigning certain components using lower cost materials and processes  technological or other challenges may prevent us from achieving all of the necessary cost reductions 
moreover  if the price of the tracvision a is not attractive to a broad range of customers  we may be forced to further lower the price  which would further impair our product profit margins unless we are able to achieve corresponding cost reductions 
high fuel prices may adversely affect sales of our mobile satellite communications products 
fuel prices have been high and may remain high or increase in the foreseeable future 
high fuel prices tend to have a disproportionate impact on the larger vehicles and vessels for which our mobile satellite communications products are designed  such as marine vessels  recreational vehicles and suvs  because they consume relatively large quantities of fuel 
the increased cost of operating these vehicles and vessels is adversely affecting and may continue to adversely affect demand for our mobile satellite communications products 
the market for mobile internet services in vehicles and vessels may fail to develop or may be satisfied by alternative technological approaches 
mobile internet access is a relatively new market that is currently focused primarily on cell phones and internet enabled pdas 
we will serve as a distributor of the msn tv service to the marine  automotive  and rv markets and as such  plan to offer what we believe will be a unique mobile internet solution 
however  
table of contents competing products based around high speed cellular services are available for single users and in integrated evdo wifi hubs 
other technological developments  such as proposed wimax networks and internet via satellite services may also displace wireless services with regard to range and cost  preventing us from successfully marketing and selling mobile internet systems in the mobile marketplace 
customers for tacnav and our other defense products include the us military and foreign governments  whose purchasing schedules and priorities can be unpredictable 
we sell tacnav and our other defense products to the us military and foreign military and government customers 
these customers have unique purchasing requirements  which can make sales to these customers unpredictable 
factors that affect their purchasing decisions include priorities for current battlefield operations  changes in modernization plans for military equipment  changes in tactical navigation requirements  allocation of funding for military programs  new military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs  sales cycles that are long and difficult to predict  shifting response time and or delays in the approval process associated with the export licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of our military products  delays in military procurement schedules  and delays in the testing and acceptance of our products 
these factors can cause substantial fluctuations in sales of tacnav and our other defense products from period to period 
moreover  tacnav and most of our other defense products must meet military quality standards  and our products may not continue to meet existing standards or more rigorous standards adopted in the future 
any failure to meet military contract specifications may produce delays as we attempt to improve our design  development  manufacturing or quality control processes 
furthermore  government customers and their contractors can generally cancel orders for our products for convenience or decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options 
even under firm orders with government customers  funding must usually be appropriated in the budget process in order for the government to complete the contract 
the cancellation of or failure to fund orders for our products could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations 
only a few customers account for a substantial portion of our defense revenues  and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales 
we derive a significant portion of our defense revenues from a small number of customers  including the us government 
the loss of business from any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business 
sales of tacnav and our other defense products generally consist of a few large orders  and the delay or cancellation of a single order could substantially reduce our net sales 
unlike our mobile satellite communications products  tacnav and our other defense products are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to more than one million dollars 
as a result  the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations 
because our defense products typically have higher direct margins than our mobile satellite communications products  the loss of an order for defense products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we may fail to continue to increase the sale of our fiber optic products for commercial uses 
our fiber optic products have numerous commercial applications where mobile communication  navigation  stabilization and precision pointing are required 
for example  our fiber optic gyros have been used in commercial applications such as train location control and track geometry measurement systems  industrial robotics  and autonomous or remotely operated vehicles 
we may not be successful in further developing and marketing our fiber optic products for commercial uses  which might limit the overall net sales of these products and limit our profitability accordingly 
we depend on others to provide programming for our tracvision products  internet access for our tracnet products  and telephone  fax and data services for our tracphone products 
our tracvision products include only the equipment necessary to receive satellite television services  we do not broadcast satellite television programming 
instead  customers must obtain programming from another source 
we currently offer marine and land mobile tracvision products compatible with the directv and dish network services in the continental united states  the expressvu service in canada and various other regional services in other parts of the world 
our tracvision a currently offers access to only the directv service in the continental united states 
although directv is offering its total choice mobile programming package at a price that we think should be attractive to consumers  directv has no obligation to continue to offer that package at the current price or at all 
if customers become dissatisfied with the programming  pricing  service  availability or other aspects of this satellite television services product or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason  we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our tracvision products 
the companies that operate these services have no obligation to inform us of technological or other changes  including discontinuation of the service  which could impair the performance of our tracvision products 
our tracphone and tracnet products currently depend on satellite services provided by third parties 
we rely on inmarsat for satellite communications services for our tracphone products 
we rely on telemar for tracnet service in europe 
our tracnet mobile internet system will use high speed evdo cellular services offered by providers such as verizon wireless as well as microsoft s msn tv service 
should evdo networks become unavailable  our tracnet would be hampered in its ability to provide two way internet access 
likewise  if the status of msn tv were to change  customers would no longer be able to access the internet via the tv screens in their boats  rvs  and cars  a feature that offers kvh a competitive advantage over other mobile internet solutions 
if any of our vendors were unable to fulfill their obligations  we would need to seek alternate suppliers or solutions 
in that case  we may be required to retrofit or upgrade hardware and software as necessary to ensure the continued operation of the affected products 
we may incur significant delays and expenses in our efforts to make the necessary changes and those efforts may be unsuccessful 
moreover  we may not be successful in identifying and entering into appropriate agreements with replacement suppliers on commercially reasonable terms  which would impair our ability to offer the affected products 
similarly  we may lose the goodwill of existing customers if any currently installed products cease to work for any extended period 
any such outcome could lead to a substantial reduction in sales 
our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of third party satellites  which face significant operational risks and could fail earlier than their expected useful lives 
our mobile satellite communications products depend on the availability of programming and services broadcast through satellites owned by third parties 
the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services  which could reduce the demand for  or customer satisfaction with  our products 
these satellites face significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions that can occur as a result of satellite manufacturing errors  problems with power or control systems and general 
table of contents failures resulting from the harsh space environment 
moreover  each satellite has a limited useful life  and the satellite providers make no guarantees that the planned backup systems and capacity will be sufficient to support these satellite services in the event of a loss or reduction of service 
we cannot assure that satellite services compatible with our products will continue to be available or that such services will continue to be offered at reasonable rates 
the accuracy or availability of satellite signals may also be limited by ionospheric or other atmospheric conditions  intentional or inadvertent signal interference  or intentional limitations on signal availability imposed by the satellite provider 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites on any system  the inoperability of any key satellite or the failure of any key satellite or satellites to provide an accurate or available signal could impair the utility of our products or the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
we depend on single manufacturing lines for our products  and any significant disruption in production could impair our ability to deliver our products 
we currently manufacture and assemble our products using individual production lines for each product category 
we have experienced manufacturing difficulties in the past  and any significant disruption to one of these production lines will require time either to reconfigure and equip an alternative production line or to restore the original line to full capacity 
some of our production processes are complex  and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of any production line 
for example  our production process uses some specialized equipment and custom molds that may take time to replace if they malfunction 
in that event  shipments would be delayed  which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
finally  we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term 
if short term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction  loss of sales and damage to our reputation 
we depend on sole or limited source suppliers  and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost 
we obtain many key components for our products from third party suppliers  and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers 
any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply  which could take several weeks  months or longer and could increase our costs significantly 
in general  we do not have written long term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders  which expose us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse 
we do not generally carry significant inventories of product components  and this could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier 
if we are required to use a new source of materials or components  it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability 
we may increase the international scope of our operations  which could disrupt our operations 
although we have historically manufactured all of our products in the us  in order for us to improve our operating margin performance and overall profitability  we may find it necessary to increase the international scope of our operations 
this could include offshore manufacturing and or the increased sourcing of raw materials from foreign countries 
we have only limited experience in foreign manufacturing and we might not be successful in implementing or integrating an extended program 
in addition  an increased reliance on foreign manufacturing and or raw material supply would lengthen our supply chain and increase the risk that a disruption in that supply chain would have a material adverse affect on our operations and financial performance 
any failure to maintain and expand our third party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile satellite communications products 
we market and sell our mobile satellite communications products through an international network of independent retailers  chain stores and distributors  as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels and recreational 
table of contents vehicles 
if we are unable to maintain or increase the number of our distribution relationships  it could significantly reduce or limit our net sales 
in addition  our distribution partners may sell products of other companies  including competing products  and are not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
moreover  our distributors may operate on low product margins and could give higher priority to products with higher margins than ours 
our net sales and operating results could decline due to general economic trends or declines in consumer spending 
our operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions 
net sales of our satellite communications products are largely generated by discretionary consumer spending  and demand for these products could demonstrate slower growth than we anticipate as a result of regional and global economic conditions 
consumer spending tends to decline during recessionary periods and may decline at other times 
consumers may choose not to purchase our mobile satellite communications products due to a perception that they are luxury items 
as global and regional economic conditions change  including the general level of interest rates  rising oil prices and demand for durable consumer products  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to improve our existing mobile satellite communications and defense products and develop new  innovative products  our sales and market share may decline 
the markets for mobile satellite communications products and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization products are each characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product innovations  changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards 
if we fail to make innovations in our existing products and reduce the costs of our products  our market share may decline 
products using new technologies  or emerging industry standards  could render our products obsolete 
if our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products that eliminate technological advantages our products may have in a certain market or otherwise outperform our products  or are perceived by consumers as doing so  we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes 
for example  other companies have either announced their intentions or have begun to offer low profile in motion satellite antennas or alternative means for providing mobile entertainment 
these products will compete with our tracvision a and may offer more attractive performance  pricing and other features 
if we cannot effectively manage our growth  our business may suffer 
we have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth placed a strain on our personnel  management  financial and other resources 
if we fail to manage our future growth properly  we may incur unnecessary expenses and the efficiency of our operations may decline 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things upgrade  expand or re size our manufacturing facilities and capacity in a timely manner  successfully attract  train  motivate and manage a larger number of employees for manufacturing  sales and customer support activities  control higher inventory and working capital requirements  and improve the efficiencies within our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems  and our procedures and controls 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations 
to meet our growth objectives  we must attract and retain highly skilled technical  operational  managerial  and sales and marketing personnel 
if we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel  we may be unable to 
table of contents achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position  which could lead to a significant decline in net sales 
we face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
our success depends on the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of martin kits van heyningen  our co founder  president and chief executive officer 
if we lost the services of mr 
kits van heyningen  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and members of senior management to work effectively as a team 
none of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers or senior management members could impair our ability to manage our business effectively 
competition may limit our ability to sell our mobile communications products and defense products 
the mobile satellite communications markets and defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets in which we participate are very competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  which could impair our ability to sell our products 
to remain competitive  we must enhance our existing products and develop new products  and we may have to reduce the prices of our products 
moreover  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of those product lines 
for example  improvements in less expensive wireless and cellular technologies may limit demand for land based satellite telephone and internet services 
in the defense navigation  guidance and stabilization markets  we compete primarily with honeywell international inc  kearfott guidance navigation corporation  leica microsystems ag  northrop grumman corporation and smiths group plc 
in the market for mobile satellite communications products  we compete with a variety of companies 
in the land mobile market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete directly with king controls  motosat  tracstar systems  inc  and winegard company 
there is also potential competition for sales of satellite tv to the automotive market from raysat  audiovox  winegard  and delphi 
in the marine market for satellite tv communications equipment  we compete with navisystem marine electronic systems srl  orbit satellite television radio network  king controls  tracstar  sea tel  inc and raymarine 
in the marine market for telephone  fax  data and internet communications equipment  we compete with furuno electric co  ltd  globalstar lp  iridium satellite llc  japan radio company  nera asa  and thrane thrane a s 
in the mobile internet market  we may compete with such products as single user evdo cards for use with individual laptops  evdo wifi hubs such as those manufactured by kyocera  junxion  and top global  proposed wimax services in urban areas  and internet via satellite systems proposed by companies such as raysat 
moreover  new competitors may surface in the future 
among the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following many of our primary competitors are well established companies that could have substantially greater financial  managerial  technical  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  product improvements or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of our products  and our competitors may have lower production costs than we do  which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions 
our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
historically  sales to customers outside the united states and canada have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
we have only one foreign sales office  which is located in denmark  and we otherwise 
table of contents support our international sales from our operations in the united states 
our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and to meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have no infrastructure 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities  which may increase our costs and require significant management attention 
these risks include technical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile satellite communication products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world  including multiple satellite services in europe  satisfaction of international regulatory requirements and procurement of any necessary licenses or permits  restrictions on the sale of certain defense products to foreign military and government customers  additional costs and delays associated with obtaining approvals and licenses under applicable export regulations  increased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages  more limited protection of our intellectual property  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  potentially longer sales cycles  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  losses arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and economic and political instability in some international markets 
if we are unable to maintain adequate product liability insurance  we may have to pay significant monetary damages in a successful product liability claim against us 
the development and sale of mobile satellite communication products and defense products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
for example  consumers may ignore laws or warnings not to watch satellite television while driving and  as a result  may become involved in serious accidents  for which they may seek to hold us responsible 
product liability insurance is generally expensive for companies such as ours 
accordingly  we maintain only limited product liability insurance coverage for our products 
our current levels of insurance or any insurance we may subsequently obtain may not provide us with adequate coverage against potential claims  such as claims by those involved in accidents caused by drivers watching television 
in addition  we may be unable to renew our policies on commercially reasonable terms or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are exposed to product liability claims for which we have insufficient insurance  we may be required to pay significant damages  which could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
exports of certain defense products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations and require a license from the us department of state prior to shipment 
we must comply with the united states export administration regulations and the international traffic in arms regulations  or itar 
our products that have military or strategic applications are on the munitions list of the itar and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions 
any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products  and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations 
the length of time required by the licensing process 
table of contents can vary  potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
any restriction on the export of a significant product line or a significant amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology 
our ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents  our source code and our other proprietary technology 
the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us 
our patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages 
existing trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation 
furthermore  other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights 
any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position  which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome  disruptive and expensive  distract the attention of management  and there can be no assurance that we would prevail 
also  we have delivered certain technical data and information to the us government under procurement contracts  and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information 
there can be no assurance that the us government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us 
pending securities class action lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we and certain of our officers are defendants in a class action lawsuit in the u 
s 
district court for the district of rhode island 
the suit asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b thereunder  as well as claims under sections  a and of the securities act of  on behalf of purchasers of our securities between october  and july  we and certain of our directors and officers are also defendants in a shareholders derivative action in the rhode island state superior court for providence county 
this suit asserts state law claims on our behalf between october  and the present arising from the allegations set forth in the class action complaint in the us district court described above 
we and certain of our directors and officers are also defendants in a shareholders derivative action in the us district court for the district of rhode island 
this suit asserts federal and state claims on our behalf between october  and the present arising from the same allegations set forth in the class action complaint described above 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not have to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement 
an unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation could materially harm our business 
litigation of this nature is expensive and time consuming and diverts the time and attention of our management 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition 
our industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents  patents that may be issued in the future  or other intellectual property rights of others 
we do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a 
table of contents rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
from time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights  and we may face similar claims in the future 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the attention of our management 
if any of our products are found to violate third party proprietary rights  we may be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we may be required to re engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products 
any efforts to re engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful  which would prevent us from selling our products  and  in any case  could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are presently a defendant in two lawsuits brought by electronic controlled systems  inc  d b a king controls  alleging infringement of three of its patents 
we are defending ourselves vigorously against these claims  but there can be no assurances that we will not have to pay significant damages or amounts in settlement  that we will not be enjoined from selling certain of our mobile satellite communications products  or that the suit will not otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial performance 
fluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including demand changes for our mobile satellite communications products and defense products  the timing and size of individual orders from military customers  our ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  our success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors  the mix of products we sell  market and competitive pricing pressures  general economic climate  and seasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment  and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our net sales decline or do not grow as much as we anticipate  we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins 
any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 

table of contents our tax planning strategy involves assumptions that may cause our annual provision for tax expense or benefit to fluctuate materially 
moreover  our tax planning strategy is based upon our ability to sell our manufacturing and corporate headquarters facility located in middletown  rhode island  as may be necessary 
we utilize a tax planning strategy as provided for under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states as a means of supporting the realizable nature of certain of our deferred tax assets 
the strategy involves our ability to sell our middletown  rhode island headquarters facility in order to generate taxable income for the sole purpose of utilizing certain of our capitalized tax loss carryforwards before they expire 
the determination of taxable income  and therefore supportable deferred tax asset value  is based upon the difference between the property s estimated fair market value and our tax basis 
accordingly  the estimated net realizable value of our deferred tax asset is highly correlated to property values in and around the middletown  rhode island area and therefore subject to changes in property value and or assumptions used in the valuation process 
this fair market value subjectivity may cause us to record significant increases or decreases to our deferred tax assets during the year 
the strategy represents an action that we ordinarily would not take  but could take  if necessary  to realize an estimated million in us deferred tax assets or the equivalent of approximately million in estimated taxable income as of december  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
our stock price has historically been volatile 
from january  to december   the trading price of our common stock ranged from to 
many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly results of operations  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changing needs of military customers  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  the hiring or departure of key personnel  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in  or adoptions of  accounting principles  market conditions in our industries  and the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
we are now defending a securities class action lawsuit 
this pending litigation has caused us to incur substantial costs and is diverting the time and attention of our management 
these adverse consequences may continue until this action is finally resolved 
any similar litigation in the future could have similar consequences 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results 
we evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to realize the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from any 
table of contents acquisition 
competition for acquisition opportunities could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks  such as charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw  diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources  loss of key acquired personnel  increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  dilutive issuances of equity securities  the assumption of legal liabilities  amortization of acquired intangible assets  and potential write offs related to the impairment of goodwill 
our charter and by laws and delaware law may deter takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti takeover effect and discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions  including the election of directors 
these provisions relate to the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock  and determine its terms  without a stockholder vote  the classification of our board of directors  which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders  the limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote  the prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent  the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations

item legal proceedings we are a defendant in a class action lawsuit in the us district court for the district of rhode island in which we and certain of our officers are named as defendants 
the suit asserts claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b under that statute  as well as claims under sections  a and of the securities act of  on behalf of purchasers of our securities in the period october  and july  and seeks certain legal remedies  including compensatory damages 
the teamsters affiliates pension plan has been appointed lead plaintiff 
this matter consolidates into one action eight separate complaints filed between july  and september  on january   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 
the court denied this motion in part and granted it in part 
on october   we answered the consolidated complaint and denied liability and all allegations of wrongdoing 
subsequently  on december   plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification  that motion is pending
