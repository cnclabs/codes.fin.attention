this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview we provide clinical drug development services on a contract basis to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
we conduct clinical trials globally and are one of a limited number of cros with the capability to serve the growing need of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to conduct complex clinical trials in multiple geographies concurrently 
we offer our clients high quality services designed to provide data to clients as rapidly as possible and reduce product development time 
we believe our iso certified services enable our clients to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and  as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  our comprehensive services and broad experience provide our clients with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
contracts determine our relationships with clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and establish the way we are to earn revenue 
two types of relationships are most common a fixed price contract or a time and materials contract 
the duration of our contracts ranges from a few months to several years 
a fixed price contract typically requires a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time the contract is entered into and the balance is received in installments over the contract s duration  in most cases when certain performance targets or milestones are reached 
service revenues from fixed price contracts are generally recognized on a proportional performance basis  measured principally by the total costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total costs for each contract 
we also perform work under time and materials contracts  recognizing service revenue as hours are incurred  which is then multiplied by the contractual billing rate 
our costs consist of expenses necessary to carry out the clinical development project undertaken by us on behalf of the client 
these costs primarily include the expense of obtaining appropriately qualified labor to administer the project  which we refer to as direct cost headcount 
other costs we incur are attributable to the expense of operating our business generally  such as leases and maintenance of information technology and equipment 
we review various financial and operational metrics  including service revenue  margins  earnings  new business awards  and backlog to evaluate our financial performance 
our service revenue was million in  million in and million in once contracted work begins  service revenue is recognized over the life of the contract as services are performed 
we commence service revenue recognition when a contract is signed or when we receive a signed letter of intent 
our new business awards during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
new business awards arise when a client selects us to execute its trial and so indicates by written or electronic correspondence 
the number of new business awards can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  and awards can have terms ranging from several months to several years 
the value of a new award is the anticipated service revenue over the life of the contract  which does not include reimbursement activity or investigator fees 
our backlog consists of anticipated service revenue from new business awards that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are contracts in process that have not been completed 
backlog varies from period to period depending upon new business awards and contract increases  cancellations  and the amount of service revenue recognized under existing contracts 
our backlog at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
from to  our service revenue grew  and our backlog grew 
this growth resulted primarily from an increase in our global projects 
global projects are typically larger in scope and increased from projects in to in income from operations was million in  million in  which includes a one time million charge for the repurchase of options and a million charge for a per vested option bonus paid to all employee option holders  and million in this growth reflects improved productivity and organic growth 
we attribute the improvement in productivity to rapid integration of our acquisitions  initiatives focused on rigorous clinical trial execution  and management of employee turnover 
during the three year period ended december   we expanded our operations in part by organic growth and through four strategic acquisitions  which were funded from cash generated from operating activities and the limited issuance of equity securities 
during the second quarter of  we acquired all of the outstanding equity of gmg biobusiness ltd gmg and regulatory clinical consultants  inc rxcci 
gmg and rxcci enhanced our existing service offerings in our global regulatory affairs group  including our electronic publishing capabilities 
we paid approximately million in aggregate cash for these acquisitions 
on october   we acquired all of the assets of valid trio gmbh 
these assets mainly comprised valid trio s business operated through its branch in moscow  russia 
valid trio expanded our capabilities to conduct clinical trials in russia  ukraine  romania  and bordering countries 
we paid million in cash 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding equity of clincare consulting bvba  based in brussels  belgium 
clincare strengthened our capabilities in cardiovascular  cns  oncology  and rheumatology clinical development and expanded our operations in belgium 
we paid approximately million in cash and equity securities  net of cash acquired 
based on detailed pre closing integration plans  each of these acquisitions was fully integrated within days of the closing 
these plans facilitated the immediate and seamless integration of each acquisition into our operating systems and procedures from the effective date of the acquisition 
during the years ended december  and  we paid a management fee to genstar capital  lp  an affiliate of our principal stockholder  totaling million and million  respectively 
subsequent to ourinitial public offering  we ceased paying this management fee  which has been more than offset by the costs of being a public company  in particular the sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
service revenue we recognize service revenue from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis as services are provided 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare each contract s direct cost incurred to such contract s total estimated direct cost through completion 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contractual obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor incurred to perform the service revenues 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized as hours are incurred  multiplied by contractual billing rates 
our contracts often undergo modifications  which can change the amount of and the period of time in which to perform services 
our contracts provide for such modifications 
most of our contracts can be terminated by our clients after a specified period  typically to days  following notice by the client 
in the case of early termination  these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  payment to us of fees earned to date  and in some cases  a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
based on ethical  regulatory  and health considerations  this wind down activity may continue for several quarters or years 
reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out of pocket costs we incur out of pocket costs  which are reimbursable by our customers 
we include these out of pocket costs as reimbursement revenue and reimbursable out of pocket expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we routinely enter into separate agreements on behalf of our clients with independent physician investigators  to whom we pay fees  in connection with clinical trials 
these investigator fees are not reflected in our service revenue  reimbursement revenue  reimbursable out of pocket costs  and or direct costs  since such fees are reimbursed by our clients  on a pass through basis  without risk or reward to us  and we are not otherwise obligated to either perform the service or to pay the investigator in the event of default by the client 
reimbursement costs and investigator fees are not included in our backlog 
direct costs direct costs consist of amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process  and include direct labor and related benefit charges and other costs primarily related to the execution of our contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of service revenue fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization in the multitude of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses consist of administration payroll and benefits  marketing expenditures  and overhead costs such as information technology and facilities costs 
these expenses also include central overhead costs that are not directly attributable to our operating business and include certain costs related to insurance  professional fees  and property 
depreciation and amortization depreciation represents the depreciation charged on our fixed assets 
the charge is recorded on a straight line method  based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years for computer hardware and software and five to seven years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over ten years or the life of the lease term 
amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on identified finite lived intangible assets on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were being amortized prior to january  pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
exchange rate fluctuations the majority of our foreign operations transact in the euro  pound sterling  or canadian dollar 
as a result  our revenue is subject to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to these currencies 
we have translated these currencies into us dollars using the following average exchange rates year us dollars per euro pound sterling canadian dollar results of operations many of our current contracts include clinical trials covering multiple geographic locations 
we utilize the same management systems and reporting tools to monitor and manage these activities on the same basis worldwide 
for this reason  we consider our operations to be a single business unit  and we present our results of operations as a single reportable segment 
the following table summarizes certain statement of operations data as a percentage of service revenue for the periods shown 
we monitor and measure costs as a percentage of service revenue rather than total revenue as this is a more meaningful comparison and better reflects the operations of our business 
year ended december  service revenue direct costs selling  general  and administrative depreciation and amortization management fee option repurchase vested option bonus income from operations interest expense interest income other income expenses  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  service revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in due to the expansion of our services to both existing and new clients and a favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
on a geographic basis  service revenue for was distributed as follows north america million  europe million  and rest of world million 
during service revenue was distributed as follows north america million  europe million  and rest of world million 
we continue to experience a shifting of work from north america into europe and the rest of the world  as we execute more complex global trials which necessitated the expansion of work into these locales 
direct costs increased by million  or  from million in to million for  due to increased personnel costs needed to support increased project related activity and were affected by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
direct costs as a percentage of service revenue decreased from in to for the improvement was a function of our attention to the efficient execution of project work 
of note was an improvement in in our gross margin for project work executed in certain european and southern hemisphere locations 
we are experiencing a growth in the level of global work and the related execution of work outside of north america  which has positively impacted our overall gross margins 
additionally  there were certain significant projects  where we achieved operational milestones in  which resulted in marginal efficiencies being realized from those projects 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million for and were affected by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
approximately million of this increase is related to labor costs incurred to support increased operational activity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue were for both and the period had one time lease termination charges of approximately million which were partially offset by incremental  first time costs for our sarbanes oxley compliance program and the charge for the resolution of the cell therapeutics arbitration in the fourth quarter sequential decline in selling  general  and administrative expense is due in part to the timing of sarbanes oxley expenses  the timing of our accruals for incentive compensation  and adjustments made to our bad debt reserve 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  from million for to million for this increase is due to continued investment in facilities and information technology to support our growth 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue was for and for income from operations increased by million  or  from million in to million for income from operations as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in in january  we closed our million tender offer and special dividend employee option bonus program 
we repurchased million of options and paid million to employee holders of vested options 
approximately million was expensed related to these items in the increase in income from operations resulted from improved operating leverage across the company and the expenses incurred related to the option repurchase and bonus program which did not occur in interest income  net increased by million  or  from expense of million in to income of million in this increase is due to the interest earned from the cash proceeds from our initial public offering and the extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of other expenses  net increased by million from million in to million for the same period of the increase is attributable to net realized and unrealized loss from transactions in multiple currencies 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to for the prior year 
this increase is due in part to the realization of acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards which were reflected as reductions in the related goodwill balance rather than as a reduction in the tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  service revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in due to the expansion of our services to both existing and new clients and a favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
on a geographic basis  service revenue for was distributed as follows north america million  europe million  and rest of world million 
for service revenue was distributed as follows north america million  europe million  and rest of world million 
our european service revenue for increased due to our execution of more global trials  the opening of new locations  and recent acquisitions 
direct costs increased by million  or  from million in to million in due to increased personnel needed to support increased project related activity 
direct costs as a percentage of service revenue decreased from in to in  due to the achievement of improved operating efficiencies  as evidenced by a increase in direct labor costs compared to an increase in service revenue 
this was achieved as previously trained employees attained higher efficiency and productivity levels and as the percentage of our new employees to total employees declined 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue was in and in july  we signed a lease for our new corporate office and moved frommclean  virginia  to our new location in reston  virginia  in november included in sg a is million of estimated lease termination charges related to this relocation 
during the second quarter of we closed our cambridge  england office to eliminate excess internal capacity 
we recorded an expense of million related to this action  which is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses and consists primarily of lease termination costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of service revenue was in and in income from operations increased by million  or  from million in to million in income from operations as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in in january  we closed our million tender offer and special dividend employee option bonus program 
in connection with this program  we repurchased million of options and paid million to employee holders of vested options 
both of these items were expensed in the increase in income from operations resulted from improved operating leverage from increased utilization across the company  partially offset by the million aggregate charge incurred in connection with the option repurchase and bonus program 
interest expense  net decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to both the lower effective borrowing rate achieved through the repayment of our subordinated debt with the proceeds from the amended credit facilities in december and the lower average outstanding debt balance during than in the prior year 
all outstanding long term debt was prepaid in november   resulting in an expense of million representing the remaining capitalized deferred financing costs 
other expenses  net decreased by million from an expense of million in to million in the decrease is attributable to a weakening of the us dollar against other currencies during as compared to and represents the transaction and revaluation impact of foreign exchange 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to for the prior year 
the increase in our effective rate was primarily due to the geographic distribution of pre tax earnings and the utilization in the prior period of net operating loss carry forwards in the united kingdom  canada  and switzerland 
variation in quarterly operating results although our business is not generally seasonal  we typically experience a slight decrease in revenue during the fourth quarter due to holiday vacations and a similar decrease in new business awards in the first quarter due to our customers budgetary cycles and vacations during the year end holiday period 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital  and other general corporate purposes 
we have historically funded our operations and growth  including acquisitions  with cash flow from operations  borrowings  and limited issuances of equity securities 
in  cash used in operations was million as compared to cash provided by operations of million for advanced billings decreased during by million compared to a million decrease for the primary reasons for this decrease are the reduced percentage of advanced funds that are received from new contracts due to the competitive forces in the market 
cash collections from accounts receivable were million in  as compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to the timing of project milestone billings 
in addition  adjustments to reconcile net income of million in to cash used in operating activities include the addback of million for depreciation and amortization  million for accounts receivable and deferred tax provisions  and a usage of million provided for by changes in assets and liabilities 
days sales outstanding  which includes accounts receivable  unbilled services and advanced billings  were a positive days and a negative twenty five days as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to experience competitive pressures that could increase this operational metric 
in  we generated operating cash flow of million as compared to million during the prior year 
the primary driver of the difference was the increase in unbilled services during of million compared to a decrease in unbilled services in of million 
cash collections from accounts receivable were million in  as compared to million in the improvement in cash collections is due to improved billing and collection procedures 
in addition  adjustments to reconcile net income of million to cash generated from operating activities include addbacks of million for depreciation and amortization and changes of million in assets and liabilities 
in  we generated operating cash flow of million as compared to million in  despite an increase in net income of million  or 
the change resulted from higher net income that was more than offset by changes in working capital 
the decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to an million increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services due to increased service revenue and project activities  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable due to our improved focus on vendor relations and related payment terms 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for compared to net cash used in investing activities of million during the year this increase of million is primarily attributable to our sale of marketable securities during the year  resulting in approximate proceeds of million 
this increase is partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures incurred in connection with the purchase of fixed assets million during as compared to million in 
of the million of purchased fixed assets million was financed by deferred payments over thirty seven months 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to million in  with the majority of the spending related to continued information technology enhancement and expansion 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
in december   we purchased approximately million of short term marketable securities 
the remaining net cash amounts were primarily related to ongoing information technology projects 
in the net cash used for acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million were partially offset by cash provided by asset disposals of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to million of cash used in financing activities in in  cash of million was provided by tax benefits resulting from the exercise of certain stock options 
additionally  cash was provided by stock option exercises of million 
net cash used in financing activities in was million compared to million of cash provided from financing activities in in  cash of million was provided by our initial public offering 
additionally  cash was provided by debt issuance of million  stock option and warrant exercises of million and stockholder receivable payments of million 
in  cash of million was used to repay debt 
additionally  million was paid in dividends 
net cash generated from financing activities in was million 
the net cash generated was primarily due to the amendment and restatement of our credit facilities on december   which provided a million term loan a and a million term loan b 
the proceeds from this amendment process were used to repay million of subordinated debt and million of related prepayment premiums 
in addition  million was reserved for the tender process  which closed in january we also obtained a million revolving line of credit 
on november   our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol prai 
the initial public offering  including the underwriters over allotment  consisted of million shares of common stock sold by us and an additional million shares sold by the selling shareholders at an initial offering price of per share 
we received from the offering net proceeds of approximately million  after offering expenses  of which we used million to extinguish all outstanding principal and accrued interest under our credit facilities and the balance of the net proceeds has been applied to general corporate purposes 
we received no proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders 
in june the company completed a secondary offering  selling approximately million shares of existing shareholders shares which increased the public float from approximately million shares to approximately million shares 
the company did not receive any cash for this transaction and incurred approximately million in expense 
in january  we closed our million tender offer and special dividend employee option bonus transaction 
we repurchased million of shares and million of our outstanding vested stock options  paid a million special dividend to our stockholders  and paid a million special bonus to employee holders of vested stock options 
the remainder of the million was used to pay fees associated with the transaction 
the funds for this transaction were provided by the december  refinancing of our credit facilities 
in  we entered into foreign currency derivatives to mitigate exposure to movements between the us dollar and the british pound and the us dollar and euro 
we agreed to purchase a given amount of british pounds and euros at established dates through the transactions were structured as no cost collars whereby we neither paid more than an established ceiling exchange rate nor less than an established floor exchange rate on the notional amounts hedged 
these derivatives were accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we recognize derivatives as instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measures them at fair value 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly the changes in fair value have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income expense 
these agreements expired throughout there were no currency derivatives held by the company at december  we entered into similar derivative agreements in and we expect to continue to use similar derivatives to mitigate our foreign currency exposure 
on december   we entered into a new unsecured revolving facility the credit facility of million led by wachovia bank  n 
a and wells fargo bank  na the following description of our revolving credit facility briefly summarizes the facility s terms and conditions that are material to us and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the facility  which is incorporated by reference to form k filed on december  the credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit that terminates on december  at any time within three years after december  and so long as no event of default is continuing  we have the right  in consultation with the administrative agent  to request increases in the aggregate principal amount of the facility in minimum increments of million up to an aggregate increase of million and which would make the total amount available under the facility million 
the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital expenses  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions  the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans for account  for the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness  and to pay fees and expenses related to the facility 
all borrowings are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including absence of a default and accuracy of representations and warranties 
a portion of the facility is also available for alternative currency loans 
the interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility are floating interest rates that  at our option  equal a base rate or a libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the base rate is a fluctuating interest rate equal to the higher of a the prime rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by wachovia as its prime rate  and b the overnight federal funds rate plus 
the libor rate is  with certain exceptions  the rate set forth on telerate page or any replacement pages on that service as the interbank offering rate for dollar deposits with maturities comparable to the interest period   or months we have chosen 
in addition  we are required to pay to the lenders under the facility a commitment fee for unused commitments at a per annum rate that fluctuates depending on our leverage ratio 
voluntary prepayments of loans and voluntary reductions in the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility are permitted in whole or in part  in minimum amounts and subject to certain other limitations 
the facility is unsecured  but we have granted a negative pledge on our assets and those of our subsidiaries that guarantee the facility for the benefit of the lenders under the facility 
the revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and a minimum net worth 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its financial covenants 
we currently have not drawn any amount of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions and investments 
we expect these activities will be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations and  if necessary or appropriate  borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or issuances of equity securities 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with cash flows from operations and our borrowing capacity under the million credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next eighteen months 
our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  compliance with regulations  international risks  and personal injury  environmental or other material litigation claims 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to the year ended december  payments due by period less than more than one year years years years total dollars in thousands long term debt  including interest payments service purchase commitments capital lease  including interest payments operating leases less sublease income total the increase in amounts attributable to operating leases after five years is due to long term leases for several of our facilities 
in april  we executed a lease for a new office in our lenexa  kansas location to replace certain existing space which expired in july  the operating lease commitment is million over the year term of the lease 
in july  we entered into a lease for a new office in reston  virginia to replace our current offices in mclean  virginia 
the lease commitment is approximately million over the ten year term of the lease 
there are no contingent cash payment obligations related to our acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
non gaap financial measures we use certain measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap financial measures are ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
these measures should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations  net income  net income per share  or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
we use ebitda to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period 
in addition  we believe ebitda facilitates company to company comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  taxation  and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense  which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance 
we also use ebitda  and we believe that others in our industry use ebitda  to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
we further believe that ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers  many of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
in addition to ebitda  we use a measure that we call adjusted ebitda  which we define as ebitda excluding the effects of a one time million tender offer specifically relating to our repurchase in of stock options and the payment of a special bonus to certain employee option holders 
in addition to our gaap results and our ebitda  we use adjusted ebitda to manage our business and assess our performance 
ourmanagement does not view the tender offer and option repurchase costs as indicative of the status of our ongoing operating performance because such costs related to a special non recurring restructuring transaction 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
for example  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  our significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debts  and any cash requirements for the replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized  which will often have to be replaced in the future  even though depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda should be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not uniformly defined and varies among companies that use such a measure 
accordingly  ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limited usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and by using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in conformity with gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition the majority of our service revenue is recorded from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance  we compare direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs through completion 
we believe this is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations because the costs relate to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the service 
direct costs are primarily comprised of labor overhead related to the delivery of services 
each month we accumulate costs on each project and compare them to the total current estimated costs to determine the proportional performance 
we then multiply the proportion completed by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue that can be recognized 
each month we review the total current estimated costs on each project to determine if these estimates are still accurate and  if necessary  we adjust the total estimated costs for each project 
during our monthly contract review process  we review each contract s performance to date  current cost trends  and circumstances specific to each study 
the original or current cost estimates are reviewed and if necessary the estimates are adjusted and refined to reflect any changes in the anticipated performance under the study 
in the normal course of business  we conduct this review each month in all service delivery locations 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to  among other things  revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate  and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
if not  we bear the risk of costs exceeding our original estimates 
management assumes that actual costs incurred to date under the contract are a valid basis for estimating future costs 
should management s assumption of future cost trends fluctuate significantly  future margins could be reduced 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects  resulting in lower margins on those projects 
should our actual costs exceed our estimates on fixed price contracts  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
we accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process 
historically  the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct  but these estimates might not continue to be accurate in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts included in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net on our consolidated balance sheets is an allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  before we do business with a new client  we perform a credit analysis 
we also review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
the reserve includes the specific uncollectible accounts and an estimate of lossesbased on historical loss experience 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to us  we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover uncollectible balances 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve 
tax valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we determined that a valuation allowance was required for specific foreign loss carry forwards as of december  if these estimates prove inaccurate  a change in the valuation allowance  up or down  could be required in the future 
our quarterly and annual effective income tax rate could vary substantially 
we operate in several foreign jurisdictions and in each jurisdiction where we estimate pre tax income  we must also estimate the local effective tax rate 
in each jurisdiction where we estimate pre tax losses  we must evaluate local tax attributes and the likelihood of recovery for foreign loss carry forwards  if any 
changes in currency exchange rates and the factors discussed above result in the consolidated tax rate being subject to significant variations and adjustments during interim and annual periods 
stock based compensation we have a stock based employee compensation plan 
we account for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have determined that all options granted under our plan had an exercise price equal to or more than the estimated fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
historically  as a private company the fair market value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors contemporaneously with the grant of a stock option 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the liquidity of our stock  our existing financial resources  our anticipated capital needs  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks  as such conditions existed at the time of the grant 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of our common stock  different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
since our initial public offering on november   the value of our common stock for purposes of evaluating stock compensation costs is based on the quoted market prices 
we measure compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
under this method  when the exercise price of options granted to employees is less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date  compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period 
as the exercise price of the stock option has equaled or exceeded the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant  no compensation expense has been recorded 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
footnote to our consolidated condensed financial statements included in this report sets forth the calculation of our net income had compensation cost been determined based on the stock s fair market value at the grant dates for awards under our stock option plan in accordance with sfas no 
as discussed in the recent accounting pronouncements section  as of january  we will be required to record as compensation expense the fair value of granted stock options that vest in accordance with the revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
based upon review of the applicable literature and the company s limited trading history  we have estimated the impact of pre tax  stock based compensation expense in fiscal year to be approximately million unaudited 
long lived assets we review long lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  we would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgments and assumptions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets at the time of acquisition require significant management judgment and estimates 
we test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets  principally trade names  on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the trade name to our carrying value 
the measure of goodwill impairment  if any  would include additional fair market value measurements  as if the reporting unit was newly acquired 
this process is inherently subjective 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimates of fair value and potentially could result in an impact to our results of operations 
inflation our long term contracts  those in excess of one year  generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
potential liability and insurance we obtain contractual indemnification for all of our contracts 
in addition  we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures and insurance 
we monitor our clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines 
we have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the united states and in many foreign countries and serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials 
we currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage with limits we believe are adequate and appropriate 
if our insurance coverage is not adequate to cover actual claims  or if insurance coverage does not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us  our business  financial condition  and operating results could be materially harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
future drawings under the facility will bear interest at various rates 
historically  we have mitigated our exposure to fluctuations or interest rate by entering into interest rate hedge agreements 
foreign exchange risk since we operate on a global basis  we are exposed to various foreign currency risks 
first  our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars  but a significant portion of our revenue is generated in the local currency of our foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translationadjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position 
in addition  two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts we enter into with our customers  which from time to time are denominated in currencies different than the particular subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by our foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until payment from the customer is received will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by us as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense or income in our consolidated statements of operations 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately and of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and euros  respectively 
the company periodically enters into foreign currency derivatives to mitigate exposure to movements between the us dollar and the british pound and the us dollar and euro 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly the changes in fair value have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
these derivatives were accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the potential decrease in net income resulting from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to the british pound and euro of would have been approximately million for the year ended december  foreign currency hedges in  we entered into a number of foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to movements between the us dollar and the british pound and the us dollar and the euro 
we agreed to purchase a given amount of british pounds and euros at established dates through these derivatives are accounted for in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we recognize derivatives as instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges 
these agreements terminated in december  there were no currency derivatives outstanding at december  we entered into similar derivative agreements in january
