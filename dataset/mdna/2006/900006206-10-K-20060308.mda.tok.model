item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview turbochef technologies  inc is a leading provider of equipment  technology and services focused on the high speed preparation of food products for the speed cook sector of the commercial cooking equipment market 
our user friendly speed cook ovens employ proprietary combinations of heating technologies such as convection  air impingement  microwave energy and other advanced methods to cook food products at high speeds with food quality that we believe to be comparable or superior to that of conventional heating methods 
we currently offer three commercial ovens the c oven  the tornado oven and  introduced in the second quarter of  our high h batch oven 
we are working to develop new ovens for the commercial cooking equipment market and to introduce speed cook ovens to the residential marketplace in early we currently derive revenue primarily from the sale of our ovens to commercial foodservice operators throughout north america  europe and australia 
in north america we sell our equipment through our internal sales force as well as through manufacturer s representatives 
in europe and australia we utilize a network of equipment distributors 
we are working to expand the market for our commercial ovens in latin america and asia 
we also derive revenues from licensing our technologies to food service equipment manufacturers 
we operate in one primary business segment 
we believe it is important to our success that we continue to sell to our existing base of commercial customers to meet their expansion or replacement needs  while at the same time we extend that customer base by concentrating our internal sales efforts on major foodservice operators and by supporting our networks of manufacturer s representatives and equipment distributors 
we must strive to do that while maintaining a cost structure for our products and controlling our operating expenses to provide a satisfactory return on sales 
we must compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and product performance  and we must meet market demand through development and improvement of our speed cook ovens and introduction of new oven products 
these same marketplace and product development factors will apply to our achieving success with the launch of our residential speed cook oven products  however  the residential market is new to us and there may be factors important to our success that are unknown to us at present 
see risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
our financial results in as compared to and reflect our efforts to strengthen our operating systems and infrastructure  solidify our sales and marketing efforts  perform under our supply agreement with the subway system  expand our non subway customer base  integrate our enersyst and global acquisitions and develop our residential oven and market strategy 
sales to subway franchisees during the equipment rollout supporting their toasting initiative resulted in concentrated revenues and income in the quarters ended september   december  and  to a lesser extent  march  in  we substantially completed the initial rollout with delivery of ovens to international subway locations 
however  the subway relationship has and should continue to be a meaningful contributor to future revenues 
demand for equipment will continue from this major customer as new subway restaurants are opened and existing restaurants seek additional ovens 
in  we focused our sales efforts on expanding our customer base and during  we will continue to focus on generating revenues from other foodservice establishments  increasing the profitability of commercial products  introducing our residential oven products and developing enabling strategies 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended december revenues cost of product sales research and development expenses purchased research and development selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges compensation and severance expenses related to termination of former officers and directors total costs and expenses operating loss income interest expense interest and other income  net total other income expense loss income before taxes provision for income taxes net loss income we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the future during  we commenced the rollout of our tornado oven to subway franchisees 
we completed the rollout in the first quarter of subway sales accounted for and of our total revenues during and  respectively 
we expect subway to be a meaningful contributor to future revenues 
during  our non subway revenue increased million  or  over we expect our non subway revenue to continue to increase in no single customer  other than subway  accounted for more than of our total revenues 
as our customer base continues to grow  we expect our customer concentration levels to decline 
during  we experienced an increase in our cost of product sales as a percentage of revenue and gross margin percentage deterioration 
the deterioration is primarily due to an increase in warranty related charges to address a longevity and reliability issue and  to a lesser extent  increases in component pricing 
in  we recorded a warranty charge of million related to our tornado oven sold to subway 
in  we experienced an increase of in our tornado oven bill of materials due to increases in component pricing  primarily the result of increased stainless steel pricing 
additionally  we experienced increased freight and handling costs 
in  we expect gross profit percentages to improve as we anticipate no recurrence of product performance issues causing material warranty related charges  as we believe a favorable sales mix will result from continued expansion of our customer base and as we expect our recently instituted price increases to take full effect in early during  we increased our research and development expenditures primarily as the result of our residential oven initiative 
in  we expect our research and development expenditures to exceed the levels as we develop additional residential and commercial products 
during  we recorded a million in process research and development charge in connection with the acquisition of technology assets from global 
we expect to record additional charges in due to additional consideration payable provided certain contingencies associated with the acquisition are met 
during  we increased our selling  general and administrative expenses by million over we expect an increase in  primarily due to increased marketing costs related to the residential product launch 
based on our analysis of the aforementioned trends and events  we expect to continue to generate net losses on a quarterly basis during primarily due to our continued investment in the residential product launch 
our future results will be affected by many factors  some of which are identified below and in section a of this report entitled risk factors  including our ability to increase our subway and non subway revenue in spite of the price increases  reduce our product warranty charges  manage costs related to the residential product launch  as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives 
application of critical accounting policies overview and definitions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  warranty reserves  accounts receivable reserves  goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation other equity instruments  income and other taxes  and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the impact of changes in key assumptions may not be linear 
our management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make highly judgmental estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  substantially all obligations relating to a sale are completed  prices are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
if the terms of a sale require installation  the revenue cycle is substantially complete after installation has occurred  therefore  revenue is recognized upon installation 
for sales where the customer has assumed the installation responsibility and for sales to designated agents  substantially all obligations are completed at the time of shipment to the customer or the customer s designated agent  therefore  revenue is recognized upon shipment 
revenue for sales of replacement parts and accessories is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
royalty revenues are recognized based on the sales dates of licensees products  and services revenues are recorded based on attainment of scheduled performance milestones 
beginning in july  certain customers may purchase extended warranty coverage for a one year period on their tornado model oven 
revenue from sales of extended warranties is deferred and recognized in product sales on a straight line basis over the term of the extended warranty contract 
we provide for returns on product sales based on historical experience and adjust such reserves as considered necessary 
to date  there have been no significant sales returns 
in and  we deferred approximately million of revenue and approximately million of costs of product sales related to ovens sold to franchisees of a major restaurant chain under a proposal which offered a future exchange for a new oven contingent on completion of a franchise wide sale and roll out of our new ovens 
in the quarter ended march   the exchange provisions contemplated by this transaction were largely satisfied and substantially all the deferred revenue and related cost was recognized in the results of operations for that period 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of sales deposits  unearned revenue from extended warranty contracts and other amounts billed to customers where the sale transaction is not yet complete and  accordingly  revenue cannot be recognized 
product warranty we warrant our ovens against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of installation 
anticipated future warranty costs are estimated based upon historical experience and are recorded in the periods ovens are sold 
periodically  our warranty reserve is reviewed to determine if the reserve is sufficient to cover the repair costs associated with the remaining ovens under warranty 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims cost may differ from amounts provided  and these differences may be material 
in the second quarter of  the company identified a potential longevity and reliability issue with the tornado oven 
the success of the toasting initiative implemented by subway  our largest customer  had resulted in higher use of the tornado oven and more cook cycles than anticipated 
we experienced increasing warranty calls from the subway installed base  as certain components degraded under the high usage much earlier than expected 
we determined that we could improve the longevity and reliability of the ovens through a change in the oven s software or operating system 
we incorporated the software change in production and launched a voluntary and proactive software upgrade program for installed units 
this program also included replacement of certain components in the ovens to ensure that the installed base of tornado ovens would benefit from the latest enhancements to the ovens 
for the year ended  we recorded a charge aggregating million or per share to increase the warranty reserve as our best estimate to address costs of warranty claims incurred  estimated future warranty claims  and the voluntary upgrade 
extensive engineering tests of the revised software provide evidence that leads us to believe that the longevity and reliability issue with subway s tornado ovens has been satisfactorily resolved 
substantially all of the ovens have been upgraded 
additionally  the one year warranty expired for approximately of the affected tornado oven base on december  at this time  we believe that  based upon historical data  the current warranty reserve is sufficient to cover the associated costs 
if warranty costs trend higher  we would need to record a higher initial reserve as well as reserve the estimated amounts necessary to cover all ovens remaining under warranty 
any such additional reserves would be charged to cost of goods sold and could have a material effect on our financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair values 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill and other acquired intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life no longer to be amortized  however  these assets must undergo an impairment test at least annually 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in october and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired  and there have been no developments subsequently that would indicate an impairment exists 
we will continue to perform our goodwill impairment review annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are currently amortizing acquired developed technology and covenants not to compete using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years 
stock based compensation and other equity instruments we follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
accordingly  we have not recorded stock based compensation expense for stock options issued to employees in fixed amounts with exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in the notes to our financial statements we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
and related pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation under the intrinsic value method permitted by apb this will require us to adopt the fair value model for recognizing compensation expense for employee stock options  and would have the effect of reducing our reported net income and net income per share 
sfas r is required to be adopted as of january  in december  in response to sfas r  the board of directors of the company  upon recommendation of its compensation committee  approved an acceleration of all unvested options granted to employees and directors under the company s stock incentive plan 
as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire approximately million shares of the company s common stock became immediately exercisable 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to minimize future compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statements of operations upon the effectiveness of sfas r 
as a result of the acceleration  we expect to reduce the stock option expense we otherwise would be required to record in connection with accelerated options by approximately million in  million in and  in in connection with the acceleration and in order to prevent unintended personal benefit to the holders of these options  the optionees agreed to certain restrictions on any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options 
these restrictions generally prevent the sale of stock obtained through exercise of an accelerated option prior to the original vesting date 
all other provisions of the original option grants remain 
employees who terminate prior to their original vesting date ostensibly receive a benefit from the acceleration of options measured by the differences in the estimated fair value of the options pre and post acceleration 
we estimate the benefit associated with possible future employee terminations is approximately  and  accordingly  recorded a one time non cash compensation charge in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceleration 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments issued based on the fair value of such services received from non employees or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
we account for transactions in which we issue convertible securities in accordance with eitf issues no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios and no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments and sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the two factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the underlying equity instruments and the volatility of such fair value 
we believe our prior and current estimates of these factors have been reasonable 
deferred income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of december   we have net operating losses nols of approximately million  of which million are subject to annual limitations resulting from the change in control provisions in section of the internal revenue code 
these nols begin to expire in additionally  we have million in income tax deductions related to stock option exercises  the tax effect of which will be reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  including those resulting from nols  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
we provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years 
despite our profitability in and our future plans and prospects  we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit  an increase in total assets and stockholder s equity  and could have a significant impact on earnings in future periods 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we make these assessments based on facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
enersyst acquisition on may   we acquired enersyst development center  llc enersyst  a leading provider and source of innovations to the foodservice industry 
historically  enersyst researched  developed and licensed its proprietary foodservice technologies to foodservice equipment manufacturers  and provided fee based consulting services to members of the foodservice industry to test and develop products for the foodservice market 
enersyst holds more than issued patents and patent applications worldwide related to heat transfer  air impingement and associated food technologies 
as a result of this acquisition  we believe we are better positioned to deliver the most advanced speed cook equipment  technology and services to customers worldwide 
the results of enersyst s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
total consideration for this transaction  million  consisted of million cash  including transaction costs  and million equity in the form of enersyst preferred membership units exchangeable in the future  at the discretion of the holders  for approximately  shares of our common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares have yet to be exchanged 
the cash portion of the acquisition was funded by a may private placement of common stock 
total goodwill recorded was million  none of which is deductible for income tax purposes 
purchase of patent and technology assets and research and development on september   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with global appliance technologies  inc global and stockholders of global 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired the patent and technology assets of global further expanding our ownership of proprietary commercial and residential speed cook technologies 
these technologies will allow us to enhance our products with additional or different features as well as enable us to expand the range of product offerings 
in exchange  global received million in cash and  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately  at the date of acquisition 
this acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition 
the aggregate consideration for the assets acquired was million including the fair value of the common stock and transaction costs  all of which was expensed as purchase of in process research and development iprd 
amounts allocated to iprd include the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility or to have alternative future use 
accordingly  this item was expensed as research and development in the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september   upon the completion of the asset acquisition 
technology development and iprd were identified and valued by an independent valuation firm through extensive interviews  analysis of data provided by global concerning development projects  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  and their expected income generating ability and associated risks 
no development projects had reached technological feasibility  therefore  all the intangible assets were deemed to be purchase of iprd 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing acquired iprd 
key assumptions for iprd included a discount rate of and estimates of revenue growth  cost of sales  operating expenses and taxes 
the purchase allocation is based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to change based on completion of the final valuation 
any changes could be material to our consolidated statement of operations 
we also entered into services agreements with the principals of global which provided  among other things  for delivery of three patent applications by the end of the first year  and two additional patent applications by the end of the eighteenth month  following closing 
if these patent applications are timely delivered  we are obligated to pay global contingent consideration in the form of three nearly equal installment payments totaling million  payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date which payments will be made in cash and in stock 
in connection with this transaction  we also entered into restrictive covenant agreements the restrictive covenant agreements with each of the two principals of global 
under the restrictive covenant agreements  the principals agreed to certain covenants regarding the disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information  and to covenants restricting their ability to compete with us 
as consideration for these covenants  each principal received million in cash at closing  and each can receive additional cash payments totaling million  which are payable in equal portions on the first three anniversaries of the closing date 
the estimated fair value of these agreements  million  will be amortized over the agreements ten year term 
the purchase agreement provides that if the patent applications are not timely delivered  or if during the eighteen month period following closing we terminate the services agreements for a material breach of the confidentiality obligations or a breach of the restrictive covenants therein  and all required patent applications have not been delivered to the registrant  any then unpaid installment payments due to global will be forfeited 
further  the purchase agreement provides us certain indemnifications 
results of operations revenues total revenues decreased  or million  to million for as compared to million for total revenues increased million for  from million for the fluctuation in total revenues from to is attributable to the initial system wide rollout of our tornado model oven to subway franchisees which commenced in and was completed in the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to increased oven sales of million related to sales to subway franchisees 
in  increased oven sales to other customers combined with increased sales of parts and consumables and revenue from extended warranty contracts accounted for an increase of million in total revenues  but did not offset the reduced sales to subway following completion of the rollout 
subway sales accounted for of our revenue in  in and in the subway rollout was  in our opinion  unusual in several respects 
the subway system comprises one of the largest foodservice operations in the us additionally  a rollout of such magnitude would not typically be completed over such a short time 
subway will continue to be an important contributor to our revenues as we supply ovens for new stores and as existing stores evaluate their needs for additional ovens 
we expect continued growth in commercial oven sales as we expand our customer base 
however  we do not expect future transactions with large foodservice operators to impact the timing and magnitude of oven sales in the same way the subway transaction has done 
royalty and services revenue  which consists principally of revenue from licensing our technology to third parties  was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  we had no revenue from royalty and services revenue in and only a partial year of such revenue in since these activities are associated primarily with the enersyst acquisition which was completed in may we expect further diminution in services revenue as the resources which generate this revenue are repurposed to support our commercial oven business and to benefit our residential speed cook oven initiative 
cost of product sales and gross profit cost of product sales for was million  a decrease of  compared to million for cost of product sales increased million for  from million for the variability in cost of product sales was due primarily to the number of ovens sold 
in  cost of product sales also included a charge of approximately million to increase the warranty reserve related to a potential longevity and reliability issue we identified in our tornado model oven installed for subway franchisees 
this issue was addressed in and we believe satisfactorily resolved 
in addition  we experienced increases in in costs related to materials and component parts  primarily stainless steel  and in freight and handling charges which have increased our cost of manufacturing 
much of our sales volume is presently based on contracts with somewhat fixed pricing which constrains our ability to pass on these increased manufacturing costs 
we did institute price increases late in for our non contract customers and we have reached agreement with our major contract customers on price increases expected to be fully effective in early that will help mitigate these increased costs 
these factors coupled with the expected lower overall margins on sales to subway franchisees resulted in increased cost of product sales as a percentage of related product sales from to cost of product sales includes the actual cost of the oven  the cost of any accessories supplied with the oven  an allocation of cost for freight  duties and taxes for the ovens imported and a reserve for warranty 
cost of product sales does not include any cost allocation for administrative and support services required to deliver or install the oven or an allocation of costs associated with the ongoing quality control of our manufacturers 
these costs are recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of product sales also does not attribute any allocation of compensation or general and administrative expenses to royalty and services revenues 
cost of product sales also includes labor  parts and payments to third party service agents in connection with fulfilling extended warranty contracts 
gross profit on product sales for was million  a decrease of million  compared to gross profit on product sales of million for gross profit on product sales increased million for as compared to million for the variation in gross profit for the three year period is directly related to the variability in unit sales as the subway rollout commenced in and was completed in gross profit on product sales as a percentage of product sales revenue decreased due to the warranty charge described above and volume pricing on sales to subway franchisees 
barring any future warranty charges in excess of reserves provided and barring continued pricing pressures on materials and components  we expect improvement in gross margins on commercial oven sales as the impact of price adjustments take effect and as the sales mix shifts to include relatively fewer sales from lower margin contracts 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits  consulting services paid to third parties  supplies  facilities and other administrative costs for support of the engineers  scientists and other research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our ovens and oven related services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for as compared to million for research and development expenses increased or  for as compared to  for the increase in as compared to  as well as as compared to  was attributable to an expanded scope of research activities to support new product development  including most recently the development of our residential speed cook ovens 
additionally  in  the enersyst acquisition increased the headcount and resources committed to research activities 
the following table quantifies the net increase in research and development expenses over periods presented in thousands increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related expenses general and administrative expenses design  prototype and other related expenses total increase we believe that research and development expenses for will exceed levels  as we continue our development efforts for residential speed cook ovens and related products and for new commercial ovens planned for introduction in late or early purchased research and development purchased research and development expenses for were million and related to the acquisition of technology assets from global 
this charge is an allocation of the purchase price  based on a valuation  to recognize the fair value of in process research and development for new products and modifications to existing products that have not reached technological feasibility or were not ready for commercial production 
the agreement regarding acquisition of these assets provides for additional consideration aggregating million to be paid contingent upon delivery of three patent applications by the end of the first year  and two additional patent applications by the end of the eighteenth month  following closing 
we expect to record additional charges for purchased research and development if these contingencies are resolved 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  consist primarily of payroll and related costs  variable commissions and bonuses for personnel and third party representatives engaged in sales functions  marketing  advertising and promotional expenses  legal and professional fees  travel  communications  facilities  insurance and other administrative expenses  depreciation of equipment and amortization of intangible assets 
these expenses are incurred to support our sales and marketing activities and our executive  finance  legal  business applications  human resources and other administrative functions 
sg a expenses increased  or million to for as compared to million for sg a increased million for  from million for these increases were due to the required expansion of operations to support the increased level of sales activity stemming primarily from the subway relationship  increased activity driven by non subway related business and  most recently  the residential oven initiative 
the more significant items of increase for included increased selling  marketing and related expenses of million  equally attributable to increased sales commissions resulting from sales by our manufacturer s representative network and increased marketing and advertising expenses related to our comprehensive branding campaign and the launch of new commercial product 
additionally  legal and professional fees increased million primarily attributable to the maytag and other litigation 
rent and occupancy costs increased million attributable to our offices in atlanta and new york and new operations center in dallas 
payroll and related expenses increased million  net  due to increased headcount for our commercial business and our residential initiative which was partly offset by a  reduction in incentive compensation related to performance 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million related to leasehold improvements and equipment in the new facilities and  to a lesser extent  increased amortization related to the enersyst acquisition and the acquisition of technology assets from global 
for compared to  the more significant items of increase included payroll and related expenses of million  including incentive pay of million related to performance  travel and related expenses of million and marketing and related expenses of million 
additionally  legal and professional fees increased million primarily attributable to the maytag litigation and significant professional fees associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance 
rent and occupancy costs increased  attributable to our new offices in atlanta and new york 
non employee compensation related to charges for stock based compensation decreased  additionally  we recorded a charge of  in the fourth quarter of to provide for the potential uncollectibility of a receivable from maytag 
the enersyst acquisition in may added sg a expenses of million related to the costs of additional personnel and facilities and increased amortization related to acquired intangibles 
depreciation and amortization expense also increased  to a lesser extent  related to tooling and other equipment purchases made to support activity from the subway relationship and leasehold improvements in new facilities 
the amounts were also reflective of a curtailment of activity in the business early in the year as financial resources became scarce 
the following table quantifies the net increase in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in thousands increase decrease in general and administrative expenses to to selling  marketing and related expenses legal and professional fees depreciation and amortization rent and occupancy costs payroll and related expenses travel and related expenses enersyst acquisition non cash compensation receivable write off other total increase for  we have augmented our sg a infrastructure in contemplation of the launch of our residential speed cook oven products in resulting in an increase of sg a expenses 
we expect a continuation of this trend as the marketing and promotion plans are finalized and the product launch is executed  however  the extent of the investment required to launch this new product in  what will be to us  a new market is difficult to quantify 
we also expect increased sales and marketing expenses in as compared to due to an expected increase in commissions as a result of higher forecasted sales and an increase the volume of sales generated by our networks of manufacturer s representatives and food equipment distributors 
overall  we expect sg a to increase in as compared to  principally the result of increased selling  marketing and related costs resulting from the launch of our residential oven model 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan to close our underperforming operation in the netherlands and re align the resources and cost structure 
we now direct the activities of all of our international distributors directly from our domestic operations center 
since we continue to have a presence in the markets previously managed by our netherlands operation  the results of that unit s operations are included in continuing operations 
the closing of the netherlands operations resulted in restructuring charges of  including  of employee severance benefits   attributable to professional and other related fees   attributable to facility leases and other costs and  of non cash charges related to impairment of leasehold improvements  a long lived asset 
we have estimated the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 
the restructuring liabilities will be fully paid through may we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future 
compensation and severance related to termination of former officers and directors concurrent with the private placement of our series d preferred stock in october and the election of new officers and board members  we terminated four former officers and or directors 
in this regard  we entered into various settlement and release and severance agreements with these individuals under which cash was given  common stock and or options were issued and or previously issued equity instruments were modified 
in connection with this  we recorded million in compensation charges in of this amount   represented cash severance and the balance was related to estimated fair value computations applied to equity instruments received and or modified 
interest income interest income includes amounts earned on invested cash balances 
interest income was million for representing earnings on proceeds from the february public offering of our common stock 
interest income was insignificant in and as we had limited resources to invest 
interest expense interest expense includes interest and other costs paid and incurred on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
we have a credit facility which has been in place for most of although we have not accessed the facility  there are fees and availability costs associated with having the facility in place 
interest expense was  for as compared to a negligible amount for in  interest expense included debt extinguishment costs of million related to retirement of a note payable 
other income expense net other income expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented 
variations during the periods are attributable to exchange rate fluctuations and the volume of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
net other income expense may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes in was  and consists of estimated federal alternative minimum tax and estimated state and local taxes 
this tax provision is an effective tax rate of and reflects utilization of approximately million in nols carried forward from prior years which reduced our taxable income in as of december   we have available approximately million in remaining nol carryforwards  of which million are subject to annual limitations resulting from the change in control provisions in section of the internal revenue code 
these nols begin to expire in additionally  we have million in income tax deductions related to stock option exercises  the tax effect of which will be reflected as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce our net deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on our previous history of losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance as of december   equal to the full amount of our net deferred income tax assets including those related to our nols 
future profitable operations would permit recognition of these net deferred income tax assets  which would have the effect of reducing our income tax expense 
future operations could also demonstrate a return to profitability sufficient to warrant a reversal of the valuation allowance  which would positively impact our financial statements 
preferred stock dividends in  we recorded a non cash charge of million to recognize as a deemed dividend the beneficial conversion feature related to our series d convertible preferred stock  all of which converted into common stock by october  liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements in connection with our product and technology development and marketing efforts have been significant 
in light of the planned launch in of our residential speed cook ovens  the capital requirements for these efforts likely will continue to be significant 
on february   we closed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at before discounts and commissions to underwriters and other offering expenses
