key performance indicators that we use to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance include revenues  costs and gross margins  and cash flows 
inter tel recognizes revenue from the following significant sources of revenue end user sales and sales type leases through our direct sales offices and national  government and education accounts division 
we recognize revenue from sales of systems and services to end user customers upon installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
we defer pre payments for communications services and recognize these pre payments as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for our sales type lease accounting  we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or 
table of contents losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are also recorded as net sales 
dealer and var sales 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenue is recognized as products are shipped to the dealers and vars and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
title to these products passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
however  in connection with our recent lake acquisition  shipments to one international dealer are initially held by that dealer on a consignment basis 
such inventory is owned by inter tel and reported on inter tel s books and records until the inventory is sold through to third parties  at which time the revenue is recorded 
resale of long distance 
we recognize revenue from long distance resale services as services are provided 
software sales 
we recognize revenues from sales of software  such as our new linktivity products discussed above upon shipment to dealers or end users 
maintenance and software support 
maintenance and software support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance or support agreement 
costs and gross margins 
our costs of products sold primarily consist of materials  labor and overhead 
our costs of services performed consist primarily of labor  parts and service overhead 
total costs of goods and services sold increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased to in compared to in the increase in the dollar amount of the cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to the higher volume of net sales  resulting in part from the lake acquisition in march however  the decline in the gross margin percentage in compared to was principally attributable to sales promotions and discounts on product and service revenues  as well as increased labor costs and lower gross margins in from our acquired lake operations relative to our consolidated gross margins from our historical operations 
the gross margin percentage was also affected by the mix of products and services sold  with a higher percentage of net sales recognized in our local  long distance and network services divisions  national  government and education accounts divisions  and datanet operations  which generate lower gross margins than other divisions within our principal operating segment 
the gross margin percentage was also lower as a result of the effects of accruals for gsa pricing issues identified in greater detail in note b significant accounting policies contingencies of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sales of systems through our direct sales organization typically generate higher gross margins than sales through our dealers and vars  primarily because we recognize both the wholesale and retail margins on these sales 
conversely  sales of systems through our dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through our direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our long distance services and datanet products typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and systems 
for revenues recognized under sales leases  we record the costs of systems installed as costs of sales 
our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel  product and software mix 
in the event that sales through our direct sales offices increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could improve 
conversely  in the event net sales to dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
our operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions and world events impacting businesses  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors  pricing pressures  the cost and effects of acquisitions and the availability and cost of products and components from our suppliers 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of such net sales in the last two weeks of the quarter 
this pattern is attributable to several factors  including the following customer leases generally expire at end of the month and commence at the beginning of the month  which naturally leads to end of period sales 
these factors apply to both end user and dealer sales 
internal sales compensation programs for our sales personnel are linked to revenues and the sales commissions generally increase at accelerated rates as sales volumes increase 
sales 
table of contents performance bonuses are also frequently tied to quarter end and year end performance targets  providing incentives to sales personnel to close business before the end of each quarter 
some price discounting to our dealer channel occurs during the last month of a quarter or year  and some dealers purchase consistently to take advantage of potential pricing discounts or end of quarter promotions 
dealer buying habits have been consistently applied for years 
in addition  we are subject to seasonal variations in our operating results  as net sales for the first and third quarters are frequently lower than those experienced during the fourth and second quarters  respectively 
with the exception of the fourth quarter  followed this historical pattern 
fourth quarter revenues were lower than originally anticipated  but we do not anticipate a significant change in this trend during cash flows 
at december   inter tel s cash and short term investments totaled million 
we also maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone  na  which is available through june  and ordinarily used to support international letters of credit to suppliers  if necessary 
historically  our primary source of cash has come from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses 
we have generated cash from continuing operations in every year since in  and  the company received net proceeds from stock offerings  offset in part by cash expended to repurchase the company s common stock 
in addition  inter tel historically has paid cash for capital expenditures of property and equipment or acquisitions 
inter tel has also received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations or from financing activities  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  to repurchase shares of the company s common stock pursuant to a board approved repurchase program of up to million announced in february  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
our consolidated net sales for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily attributable to the lake acquisition in march net sales decreased in our direct sales and dealer network  but increased in our local  long distance resale  network services  datanet and international sales excluding lake divisions 
we cannot predict whether recent trends in revenue will continue in the future 
in addition  we believe uncertainty exists in the marketplace caused by the transition of communication systems from circuit switch to packet switch architectures  including voice over internet protocol voip systems  and this uncertainty may cause some organizations to delay making investments in new systems 
accordingly  we believe businesses may be reluctant to significantly increase spending on enterprise communications systems in the near future 
we expect enterprises to continue to be concerned about their ability to increase revenues and profitability  due in part to the uncertain economic environment of the past few years 
to maintain or improve profitability  we believe that businesses have attempted to reduce costs and capital spending 
we expect continued pressure on our ability to generate or expand sales and it is not clear whether enterprise communications spending will improve in the near term 
we cannot predict the nature  timing and extent of future enterprise investments in communications systems and as a result  if our net sales will increase 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid technological changes and increasing customer requirements 
we have sought to address these requirements through the development of software enhancements and improvements to existing systems and the introduction of new systems  products  and applications 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars relative to the prior year as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products  however  these expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
inter tel s research and development efforts over the last several years have been focused primarily on the development of  and enhancements to  our axxess system  including adding new applications  enhancing and developing new ip convergence applications and new sip and ip endpoint technology  developing unified communications applications  developing presence management applications  and developing speech recognition and text to speech applications 
more recently  inter tel s research and development efforts have been focused on the development of the new inter tel network communications family of products  next generation inter tel lan enabled telephony platforms  cost

the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in compared to was primarily due to sales promotions and discounts on product and services revenues  as well as increased labor and overhead costs  and the lake acquisition as identified above 
the gross margin percentage was also affected by the mix of products and services sold  with a higher percentage of net sales recognized in our local  long distance and network services divisions  and our datanet operations  which generated lower gross margins than our principal operating segment

we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars relative to the prior year as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in  an increase of compared to million in these expenses also increased slightly as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to increased sales and expenses associated with our lake acquisition in march to a lesser degree  the increase in sg a was due to additional costs associated with our linktivity acquisition in october  higher costs in related to a full year of direct sales offices acquired in compared to partial year costs in  and increases in temporary help and depreciation expenses primarily related to acquisitions and information technology expenditures compared to benefits expenses increased million in due to the rising costs of health care 
the increase in sg a was also attributable to additional professional fees incurred  including higher legal and accounting costs 
we also incurred additional marketing expenses related to the roll out of new products  including our inter tel platform 
we will continue to incur marketing expenses with the anticipation of the introduction of new releases of inter tel series products and our inter tel platform in the increase in sg a during was in part due to costs accrued in the second quarter of related to the gsa pricing and trade agreement matters identified in greater detail in note b significant accounting policies contingencies of notes to the consolidated financial statements

in the fourth quarter of  the company s management decided to shut down the operations in japan 
the write off of japan consisted of the recognition of the valuation allowance 
table of contents and japanese loss  as well as a tax benefit for the write off of the investment

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of restated net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales  in gross profit and gross margin increased in compared to as a result of several factors  including higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  and efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors

the gross margins in nsg decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to lower volume of higher margin nsa revenues  offset in part by improved gross margins in our long distance resale operations due to more favorable pricing with vendors on higher resale volumes 
net sales from long distance and network services increased by  or million  in compared to however  sales from nsa decreased  or million  in compared to  which partially offset our overall increase in consolidated gross margin

in the fourth quarter of  the company s management decided to shut down the operations in japan 
the write off of japan consisted of the recognition of the valuation allowance and japanese loss  as well as a tax benefit for the write off of the investment 
in prior years the tax benefit of the japanese operations were offset by a valuation allowance due to historical losses and an inability to project future income by management 
net deferred tax liabilities increased in primarily due to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  temporary differences relating to leases in our totalsolution sm program and utilization of taxable losses which decreased the net operating loss carryforward deferred asset 
the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets

on january  inter tel purchased certain computer telephony assets and assumed certain liabilities of executone information systems  inc executone 
the executone transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  of which million million after taxes was written off as purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the executone acquisition  we sold executone s manufacturing assets and liabilities to jabil circuit  inc formerly varian  inc 
of tempe  arizona at a net book value of million 
during the second quarter of  we decided to close the primary executone facility in milford  connecticut and to recognize a restructuring charge related to our exit plan and closure of the executone operations 
we have accounted for the restructuring of the executone operations  including severance and related costs  the shut down and consolidation of the milford facility and the impairment of assets associated with the restructuring 
we finalized our plan for the exiting of activities and the involuntary termination or relocation of the employees 
accrued costs associated with this plan were estimates  although the original estimates made for the second quarter of for reserve balance did not change significantly and the final costs incurred resulted in a nominal adjustment to current operating results during exit costs associated with the closure of the milford facility also included liabilities for building  furniture and equipment lease  and other contractual obligations 
we were liable for the lease on the milford buildings through january  various other furniture  computer and equipment leases terminated on varying dates through september the reserves for lease and other contractual obligations are identified in the table below 
the total restructuring charge from this event totaled million

inflation currency fluctuation inflation and currency fluctuations have not previously had a material impact on inter tel s operations 
international procurement agreements have traditionally been denominated in us currency 
moreover  a significant amount of contract manufacturing has been or may be moved to alternative sources 
the expansion of international operations in the united kingdom and europe and increased sales  if any  in ireland  europe and australia as a result of the lake acquisition could result in higher international sales as a percentage of total revenues  however  international revenues do not currently represent a significant portion of our total revenues

in addition  there were no long term investments in marketable debt securities at december   compared to million at december  we maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with jpmorgan chase bank  na that is available through june  under the credit facility  we have the option to borrow at a prime rate or adjusted libor interest rate 
historically  we have used the credit facility primarily to support international letters of credit to suppliers

we expect to expand sales through our direct sales offices and dealer networks  which is expected to require the expenditure of working capital for increased accounts receivable  inventories and net investment in sales leases 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   primarily in the form of million used in acquisitions and million used in capital expenditures  compared to million used in investing activities in  which also primarily related to capital expenditures  and to a lesser extent acquisitions

sold lease rentals totaling and million remained unbilled at december  and december   respectively 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
although we to date have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under the totalsolution sm program profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we are required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results will be adversely affected 
during  the company has entered into rate lock agreements with a financial institution in the form of commitments to sell the cash flow streams for leases at a fixed interest rate to the financial institution 
as of december   the company has one outstanding agreement in place to sell cash flow streams with a present value of million in march at a fixed interest rate to the financial institution 
should 
table of contents interest rates decrease substantially  the company has the option to pay a fee to the financial institution to cancel the commitment 
on january   the company received court approval of a civil settlement agreement the civil settlement and a criminal plea agreement the plea agreement with the united states of america  each dated as of december  and disclosed on that same date 
the court approval of the civil settlement and plea agreement resolves the investigation of the department of justice into the participation of inter tel technologies  inc  the company s wholly owned subsidiary technologies in a federally administered e rate program to connect schools and libraries to the internet 
in connection with the civil settlement  technologies paid a penalty of million and forgave the collection of certain accounts receivable of million related to technologies participation in the e rate program 
in connection with the plea agreement  technologies entered guilty pleas to charges of mail fraud and an antitrust violation 
under the plea agreement  technologies paid a fine of million and is observing a three year probationary period  which has  among other things  required technologies to implement a comprehensive corporate compliance program 
the resolution has cost inter tel approximately million in total  including criminal fines  civil settlement and restitution  uncompensated e rate work  accounts receivable forgiveness  and related remaining attorneys fees and other expenses 
the payments constituting the primary components of the settlement are not tax deductible 
the effect of the resolution on results of operations was a reduction to net income by approximately million  after considering accounts receivable reserves previously accrued and an income tax benefit of approximately million related to attorneys fees and other expenses 
during the second quarter of  we identified variances in our sales processes as they relate to certain terms included in the us general services administration gsa pricing and trade agreement requirements applicable to our business 
as a result of this identification  inter tel made voluntary self disclosure of the matter to the inspector general of the gsa 
the potential variances relate primarily to compliance with certain pricing thresholds and compliance with trade agreements that are applicable to transactions with certain government agencies 
we continue to review our compliance and have taken appropriate corrective measures with respect to these potential variances 
in the second quarter  we accrued million in estimated pre tax adjustments  including reductions in net sales and increases to costs  fines and penalties that may be incurred to correct this issue  of which we have paid million through december  there can be no assurance that our actual costs  including fines and penalties  if any  associated with this matter will not be more or less than our estimate  although our estimate at december  remains the same as the total identified as of the end of the second quarter of the total sales potentially subject to the gsa agreements were approximately million during the period from march  through june  our current contract with the gsa expires in march  but we have requested and expect to receive a five year contract extension 
during the third quarter of  pre tax costs associated with a legal judgment  legal settlement and related costs identified separately in the consolidated statements of income totaled million  net of amounts previously accrued 
as disclosed in august on form k filed with the sec  a florida state court jury rendered a verdict against inter tel the florida trial in the net amount of approximately million 
the company also accrued additional legal costs in connection with the florida trial 
although the company is appealing the verdict  the company accrued the net verdict amount  plus legal costs incurred in the third quarter 
should the company be successful or unsuccessful in the appeals process  these costs may be adjusted in the future 
in connection with the appeal of the florida trial  the company posted collateral of million in order to secure an appellate bond 
the company also reached a separate settlement in another legal matter during the third quarter in connection with a longstanding dispute with a third party vendor and customer 
the net settlement plus related legal fees incurred during the third quarter for both events totaled approximately million  net of amounts previously accrued  and are included in the pre tax total costs of million identified above 
further  in march  other prior executone dealers filed a complaint in columbus  ohio similar to the complaint in the florida trial 
any such similar litigation would subject inter tel to additional expenses and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
subsequent to december   the company settled another legal matter in connection with a longstanding dispute with a former international dealer that existed as of december  the company recorded an accrual for the settlement amount and related fourth quarter legal fees as of december  the settlement plus related fourth quarter legal fees totaled million 
additional legal fees totaling approximately million are expected to be recorded as period costs during the first quarter of relating to this matter 

table of contents we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  to fund quarterly dividends to shareholders  to repurchase shares of the company s common stock pursuant to a board approved repurchase program  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent additional funds are required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  we will seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations we had the following contractual obligations outstanding amount of commitment expiration per period less than after in thousands total year years years years december  operating lease obligations  primarily for building and equipment leases totals at december  total contractual obligations do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
noncancellable operating leases are primarily for buildings 
certain of the operating leases contain provisions for renewal options and scheduled rent increases 
see properties in item for further information on leased properties 
beginning in  we leased a milford  connecticut building in connection with the executone acquisition 
the lease expired on january   and we did not renew that lease 
the costs included in the milford operating lease were  in in connection with the executone charge taken in  we accrued the anticipated lease costs through the lease termination date  offset by expected sublease receipts 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on inter tel and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
in connection with the acquisition of the rights to certain developed technology for a capitalized purchase price of million included in purchased intangible assets during the year ended december   the company entered into an arrangement with the selling entity under which the selling entity would perform additional development activities on a cost reimbursement basis through august  under the terms of the arrangement  the selling entity could also earn bonus payments totaling up to  for meeting certain development milestones 
milestone bonuses totaling  for the year

the following table summarizes details of the expenses in connection with this technology investment recorded during the respective periods in thousands milestone bonus payments accrued development activities on a cost reimbursement basis totals off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that involve unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
however  we offer to our customers lease financing and other services through our inter tel leasing  inc subsidiary 
we fund our totalsolution sm program in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts

critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statement 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
revenue derived from sales of systems and services to end user customers is recognized upon primary installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
pre payments for communications services are deferred and recognized as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenues are recorded as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
these shipments are primarily to third party dealers and distributors  and title passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
long distance services revenues are recognized as service is provided 
we provide a number of incentives  promotions and awards to certain dealers and other distributors 
these incentives primarily represent discounts which are recognized as a reduction of sales  advertising allowances and awards which are recognized as marketing expense and management assistance which is expensed as incurred 
revenues for sales of software to dealers or end users are generally recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to software support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the support or maintenance agreements 

table of contents sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we follow the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases and fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the costs of systems installed under these sales leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  current and long term components of net investments in sales leases on the balance sheet  or included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet for our lease streams sold with recourse 
historically  our reserves have been adequate to cover write offs 
during the year ended december   our total reserve for losses related to the lease portfolio remained relatively consistent from to  based primarily on similar write off experience and accounts receivable agings 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
conversely  if collections experience improves  our reserves could be subject to reduction 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   inter tel had gross goodwill of million and accumulated amortization of million 
inter tel completed one acquisition in and five in and has not recorded any amortization for these acquisitions on amounts allocated to goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
the company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  the company will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have incurred 
inter tel performed the first step of the required impairment tests for goodwill as of december  and determined that goodwill is not impaired and it is not necessary to record any impairment losses related to goodwill 
in  million of the company s goodwill  net of amortization  relates to the company s principal segment and million relates to the network services segment 
there is only one reporting unit ie  one component as defined in paragraph of sfas within each of the company s two operating segments as defined in paragraph of sfas therefore  the reporting units are identical to the segments 
fair value has been determined for each segment in order to determine the recoverability of the recorded goodwill 
at december   the company primarily considered an allocated portion of the market capitalization for the entire company using average common stock prices in determining that no impairment has occurred 
this allocated market capitalization value far exceeded the net carrying value of the reporting units 
therefore  the second step for potential impairment was unnecessary 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its purchased intangible assets  all of which are subject to amortization  each reporting period 
any changes to estimated remaining lives prospectively effect the remaining period of amortization 
in addition  the purchased intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
a loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value 
as of december   inter tel had gross purchased intangible assets of million and accumulated amortization of million 
other acquisition related intangibles  comprised primarily of developed technology year lives  customer lists year lives and non competition agreements year lives  are amortized on a straight line basis 
the useful lives for developed technology are based on the remaining lives of acquired patents or the estimated useful life of the technology  whichever is shorter 
the useful lives of the customer lists are based on the expected period of value for such lists 
the useful lives for non competition agreements are based on the contractual terms of the agreements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additional reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for our sales type leases  discussed above in sales leases 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
in evaluating our allowance we consider accounts in excess of days old as well as other risks in the more current portions of the accounts included 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost principally on a standard cost basis  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method or market 
significant management judgment is required to determine possible obsolete or excess inventory and we make our assessment primarily on a significant product by product basis and consider whether such products turned in the immediately preceding twelve month period  adjusted for expected changes in projected sales or marketing demand 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet estimated future needs 
we consider criteria such as customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies  slow moving inventory and market conditions 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in estimating obsolescence  we primarily evaluate estimates of demand over a month period and provide for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated month demand 
if actual customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have provided for a valuation allowance of million related to carryforwards of net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary in connection with the march lake acquisition 
the remaining deferred tax assets have no valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   our gross deferred tax asset was million 
numerous taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax positions taken by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these jurisdictions 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss  or can estimate a minimum amount of a loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our claims and pending litigation  revise our estimates and accrue for any losses to the extent that they are probable and the amount is estimable 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
however  at december   management did not believe that the ultimate impact of various claims and pending litigation would have a materially adverse impact on the company

we maintain reserves for loan losses on all leases based on historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
although to date we have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under our lease programs profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty 
if we were required to repurchase rental streams and realize losses thereon in amounts exceeding our reserves  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis and notes b and e of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our lease portfolio and financing 
impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we invoice the customers of our international subsidiaries primarily in the local currencies of our subsidiaries for product and service revenues 
inter tel is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has not historically been significant 
the march acquisition of entities in ireland could increase our exposure to foreign currency rate changes
