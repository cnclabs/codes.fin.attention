item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  predicts  expects  estimates  intends  will  continue  may  potential  should and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including  among others  those discussed in this section as well as under item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s future sec reports 
we are a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems that accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics  proteomics and parallel chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
our solutions are based on our advanced core technologies that integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology  and chemistry 
we enable our customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
our customers include leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
the success of our business is impacted by research and development spending trends of these customers  which has been unpredictable over the last three years and remains unpredictable in the near term 
we focus on generating revenue growth through the development of innovative products for these customers 
in each of the last five years  our internal research and development efforts have enabled us to exceed our goal of generating over of annual revenues from products introduced in the last three years 
we divide our revenues into two product families based primarily on the customers to which they are sold 
the drug discovery product family includes systems that integrate detection  liquid handling and automation  have price points in excess of  and are primarily sold to large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
product lines included in the drug discovery family are the flipr  automated electrophysiology  high throughput imaging and analyst product families 
the life sciences research product family consists of spectramax  genepix  metamorph  cellular neurosciences  liquid handling and threshold product lines 
these single purpose instruments generally cost less than  and are sold throughout our entire customer base 
we recognize revenue on the sale of these products  when collectibility is reasonably assured  at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
we are deriving an increasing portion of our revenues from overseas operations 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of total revenue in  in  and in we currently have sales and services offices in the united kingdom  germany  japan  china and south korea 
in addition  we employ sales and service personnel in canada  france  the benelux  scandinavia  spain and australia 
additional international sales are conducted through distributors around the world 
we anticipate that international sales will account for an increasing percentage of revenues in the future  and we expect to continue expanding our international operations in order to take advantage of increasing international market opportunities 
our international business exposes us to a number of risks that are described under item a risk factors above  including political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  
table of contents the impact of business cycles and downturns in economies outside of the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to export our products or sell into particular jurisdictions  import and export license requirements and restrictions  difficulties and costs of staffing  managing and monitoring geographically disparate operations  difficulties in maintaining effective communications with employees and customers due to distance  language and cultural barriers  disruptions in international transport or delivery  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights  particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the united states  difficulties in enforcing agreements through non us legal systems  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting receivables  potentially adverse tax consequences  and foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
in march  we completed the purchase of certain assets from xsira relating to the transfluor technology  a cell based fluorescent assay system for monitoring the function of g protein coupled receptors 
we acquired million of intangible assets  including million of developed technology and tradenames valued at million 
we also acquired million of other current assets consisting of receivables assigned to us in the purchase 
on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of axon 
this acquisition expanded our product portfolio with systems for cellular neurosciences and genomics and combined complementary product lines in high throughput imaging and automated electrophysiology 
this acquisition did not cause us to create a new business segment 
the total cost of the acquisition was million including cash and stock paid  options assumed  and direct transaction costs 
as a result of the acquisition  we received million in cash that had been on the balance sheet of axon 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of axon have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we allocated the purchase price based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a valuation of the purchased intangible assets was undertaken by a third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of each identifiable asset and in allocating the purchase price among acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to acquired in process research and development projects 
the analysis resulted in million of the purchase price being allocated to acquired in process research and development and charged to earnings 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we apply the provisions of the following authoritative literature in the development of our revenue recognition policies emerging issues task force  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements and there are no rights of return or additional performance guarantees by us 
statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements as determined by means of our quoting process and published price lists 
staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of instruments to end users with a one year warranty 
these arrangements include a single element the instrument 
other single element arrangements include the sale of consumables  software  service  technology licenses  installation or training 
arrangements incorporating multiple elements may exist  either through one invoice or through separate invoices entered into with a single customer at or near the same time 
these multiple element arrangements can include any combination of the previously described products or services 
if there are multiple elements not delivered together  we recognize revenue on delivered elements when the fair value of any undelivered elements is known 
all single element and multiple element arrangements are evidenced by an invoice in response to a written purchase order or license agreement 
each element of an arrangement is invoiced at fair value as determined by means of our quoting process and published price lists 
standard end user terms include risk of loss transferring to the purchaser at the time of shipment  net day payment terms  no right of return or exchange  no right to upgrades and no acceptance provisions 
we do not enter into arrangements that require performance in excess of our published specifications 
our revenue recognition criteria are as follows 
in multiple element arrangements  each element is invoiced at fair value  and our revenue recognition criteria are applied to each element of the arrangement 
instruments  software and consumables we recognize revenue with respect to sales of instruments  software and consumables at the time that an instrument  software or consumable is shipped  in accordance with the shipping terms of the invoice 
under fob destination terms  we do not recognize revenue until the product arrives at the customer site 
we determine that the sab criteria have been met through receipt of a valid purchase order and issuance by us of either a sales order confirmation or an invoice  confirmation of product shipment or receipt  when fob destination terms apply  issuance of an invoice indicating the price and determination of credit worthiness or  in certain circumstances  receipt of prior payment 
service  installation and training revenue from service events not covered by warranty or a service contract is recognized upon completion of the service 
service can be provided in the field or at our service depot 
for a small number of products  we offer the option to purchase installation services 
installation is billed separately at the time of performance and is not part of a package price for instruments 
we have established a fair value for installation services  as installation can be purchased with or without an instrument 
further  a third party or the customer can perform the installation 
training is billed separately at the time of performance and is not part of a package price for instruments 
training revenue is recognized upon completion of the training 
we determine that the sab criteria have been met through receipt of a 
table of contents valid purchase order and issuance by us of either a sales order confirmation or an invoice  receipt of a customer acknowledgment that the service  installation or training has been completed  issuance of an invoice indicating the price and determination of credit worthiness or  in certain circumstances  receipt of prior payment 
service contracts revenue from service contracts for our instruments  generally with a one year term  is recognized ratably over the period of coverage 
we determine that the sab criteria have been met through receipt of a valid purchase order and issuance by us of either a sales order confirmation or an invoice  issuance of an invoice indicating the price and determination of credit worthiness or  in certain circumstances  receipt of prior payment 
technology license agreements revenue from technology license agreements is recognized upon completion of our obligations to the licensee 
we determine that the sab criteria have been met through receipt of an executed license agreement and determination of credit worthiness or  in certain circumstances  receipt of prior payment 
we have no ongoing obligations under our current technology license agreements 
warranty future warranty costs are estimated based on historical experience and provided for at the time of sale 
accounts receivable we sell our products primarily to corporations  academic institutions  government entities and distributors within the drug discovery and life sciences research markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we provide reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  historical losses and customer credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the reserve 
estimated losses have historically been within our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
such write downs have historically been within our expectations 
goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded value of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million  respectively 
the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we perform our goodwill impairment tests annually  and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has occurred 
we assess potential impairments to other intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our business  market condition and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other 
table of contents intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
equity investments we have invested in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
as of december   we had an investment in one company with a carrying value of million  which is included in intangible and other assets 
this investment is accounted for under the cost method because our ownership is less than percent of voting securities and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the estimated fair values of our non marketable investments 
we monitor the preceding factors to identify events or circumstances that would cause us to test for other than temporary impairment and revise our assumptions for the estimated recovery of equity investments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances periodically 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects upon our effective tax rate in the future 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  international operations and our success in research and development and commercializing products

on july   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of axon 
in connection with the acquisition of axon  we entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with union bank of california  na  which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to million 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
all loans outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate plus or the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
the revolving credit facility may be drawn  paid and reborrowed at our option  and matures on july  we initially used million of this credit facility to partially finance the cash portion of the merger consideration paid to axon shareholders and certain optionholders 
the million drawdown was repaid and the revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december  or we believe that our existing cash and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate our anticipated cash flow from operations is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under item a risk factors including  in particular  variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our products and collect accounts receivable  the timing of customer orders  competition  risks associated with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  supplier or manufacturing problems or delays  and risks associated with past and potential future acquisitions 

table of contents likewise  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on our current plans which may change and assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research and development programs  market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  the costs associated with repurchasing shares of our common stock  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow to fund our capital requirements primarily through operating and financing activities over the last three years 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all  and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations our facilities are leased under noncancelable operating leases 
in addition  we have contractual commitments for the purchase of products  components and services ending in as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in millions payments due by period and total to to thereafter operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in january  we entered into agreements to extend the operating leases and reduce the monthly lease payment for two of our facilities as described in item b other information 
the impact of these agreements is included in the contractual obligations table above

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial investments is included in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
foreign currency exchange we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  germany  france  the benelux  scandinavia  canada  switzerland  japan  south korea and china  where we sell many of our products directly in local currencies 
all other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign sales for the fiscal year  indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
however  owing to the number of currencies involved  the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  and our constantly changing currency exposures  we cannot predict with certainty the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest and investment income our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with us banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within days to two years  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at december  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending upon actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
debt and interest expense in connection with the acquisition of axon in  we entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with union bank of california  na  which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to million 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
all loans outstanding under the senior unsecured credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate plus or libor plus 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our debt balance at december  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no balance outstanding at year end 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on the level of our outstanding debt and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements
