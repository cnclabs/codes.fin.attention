index to financial statements overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets products based on our patented coblation technology 
our products allow surgeons to operate with increased precision and accuracy  limiting damage to surrounding tissue thereby reducing pain and speeding recovery for the patient 
our products operate at lower temperatures than traditional electrosurgical or laser surgery tools and enable surgeons to ablate  shrink  sculpt  cut  or aspirate soft tissue in surgery procedures with one multi purpose surgical system 
we have organized our marketing and sales efforts based on product markets 
these business units are comprised of the following sports medicine shoulder and knee arthroscopic products  ent to include ear  nose  throat and the visage cosmetic products  arthrocare spine to include spinal and neurosurgery products and coblation technology to include gynecology  urology  laparoscopic  general surgical and cardiology products 
coblation technology is applicable across many soft tissue surgical markets 
our systems are used to perform many types of arthroscopic surgery 
our strategy includes applying our patented coblation technology to a broad range of other soft tissue markets  including spinal surgery  neurosurgery  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  general surgery  gynecology  urology and various cardiology applications 
in april  we announced that we had entered the cosmetic surgery market and formed a business unit called visage to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in may  we announced that we had entered the ear  nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called entec to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in september  we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market 
in february  we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery 
we are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide 
in january  we acquired mda and its majority owned subsidiary  parallax  a business focused on the treatment of vertebral compression fractures 
in november  we acquired opus medical  a business focused on soft tissue to bone repair systems  including systems for the treatment of rotator cuff injuries 
we have received k clearance to market our arthroscopic system for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  ankle  elbow  wrist and hip  and our arthroscopy system is ce marked for use in arthroscopic surgery 
our spinal surgery system is ce marked and we have received k clearance in the united states to market this system for spinal surgery and neurosurgery 
our ent surgery system has received k clearance in the united states and is ce marked for general head  neck and oral surgical procedures  including tonsillectomy  adenoidectomy  snoring and the treatment of hypertrophic nasal turbinate and submucosal tissue channeling and shrinkage 
our cosmetic surgery system is ce marked for general dermatology and skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction procedures and we have received k clearance for use of our cosmetic surgery system in general dermatology procedures and for skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction in the united states 
we have received k clearance to market coblation technology for general surgery  gynecology and urology 
in december  we introduced our arthroscopy system commercially in the united states and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system 
our strategy includes placing controller units at substantial discounts or placing controllers at customer sites at no cost in order to generate future disposable product revenue 
our strategy also includes applying our patented coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets  including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery  neurosurgery  gynecology  urology  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  cardiology and general surgery 
we have received k clearance for use of our technology in several fields 
we cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product and royalty revenue after shipment of our products to customers and fulfillment of any acceptance terms  and when no significant contractual obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is reported net of a provision for estimated product returns 
revenue related to collaborative research and development contracts is recognized as the related work is performed 
we recognize license fee and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
royalties are recognized as earned  generally based on the licensees product shipments 
these items are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues on the accompanying statements of operations 
amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling costs have also been classified as royalties  fees and other revenues and related costs are classified as cost of product sales on the accompanying statements of operations 
additionally  we assess risks of loss on accounts receivable and make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  the age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses associated with accounts receivable 
inventory allowance inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
we record an allowance against our inventory value to the extent we believe that demand for certain inventory items has decreased or if certain inventory items have become obsolete 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
business combinations accounting for our business acquisitions requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between net tangible assets  in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  on january  in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we assess our goodwill for impairment on december of each year and during an interim period if facts or circumstances would more likely than not suggest that the fair value of an identified reporting unit is below its carrying value 
we currently have recorded goodwill related to our acquisitions of atlantech  mda and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements opus medical 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
impairment is measured by the difference between the recorded value of goodwill and its implied fair value when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net book value 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of each asset 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period 
to date  we have not had an impairment associated with these intangible assets 
in connection with the opus and ati acquisitions  we made significant estimates of million and million  respectively  related to the valuation of purchased in process research and development ipr d projects 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects which have no alternative future use  including those for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility or have not received regulatory approval 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition  in accordance with accepted valuation methods  and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accrual estimates should be adjusted 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting 
under this method  employee stock based compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the award 
we account for stock options issued to non employees using the fair value method of accounting  which requires us to assign a value to the stock options issued based on the black scholes pricing model and to record that value as a compensation expense over the period the award vests 
if we were to account for stock options issued to employees using the fair value method of accounting rather than the intrinsic value method  our results of operations would be significantly affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current application of statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for stock based compensation to our stock compensation program and for a discussion of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  statement r  which we will adopt beginning january   and which we expect to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
a number of uncertainties  including our future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures  employee stock option exercise behavior  interest rate 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fluctuations  and related tax implications affect our assessment of estimated compensation charges 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value estimation method for our awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over our awards vesting periods

index to financial statements product sales by geography for the periods shown were as follows dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  americas united kingdom rest of world total product sales our sustained increase in direct sales presence has continued to have a positive effect on product sales since inception  as did the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through promotional programs of controller placements  commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy  and the introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform 
additionally  our acquisitions of atlantech  parallax and opus medical product lines have continued to have a positive effect on sales growth 
we generally sell our disposable devices at or near list price  except for sales to international distributors and marketing partners  which are sold at discounted prices 
we anticipate that disposable device sales will remain a key component of our product sales in the near future 
based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year  we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market  while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment 
to achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time  we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures  expand physicians education with respect to coblation technology  and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications 
we believe that  in our nine years of product shipments  we have penetrated to of the hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states 
we believe that approximately of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures 
we expect our sales to continue to be strong in  as we continue to increase our presence in europe and add the recently acquired mda and opus medical product lines to our sales mix 
royalties  fees  and other revenues consist mainly of revenue from the licensing of our products and technology 
royalties  fees  and other revenues increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  as a result of increased sales of our products 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consist of manufacturing costs  material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs 
additionally  cost of product sales includes amortization of controller unit placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of controller units shipped to customers  with the costs being capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the useful life of the controller unit 
amortization of controllers was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
controller amortization represented of product sales in this is compared to and  when controller amortization represented of product sales in and  respectively

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement r 
generally  statement r requires companies to recognize as compensation expense in the statements of operations the fair value of share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and the right to purchase shares under an employee stock purchase plan 
in january  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for statement r 
we are required to adopt statement r in the first quarter of fiscal and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the standard on our operating results and financial condition 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under statement will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
statement r permits adoption using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate all

index to financial statements periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we will adopt the standard using the modified prospective method beginning january  we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value estimation method for our awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over our awards vesting periods 
as a result of the provisions of statement r  we expect the compensation charges under statement r to reduce diluted net income per share by approximately to per share for fiscal however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of uncertainties  including our future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures  employee stock option exercise behavior  and related tax implications 
additionally  fas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce our operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the period after adoption 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss amounts  for the years ended december    and as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under statement r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards
