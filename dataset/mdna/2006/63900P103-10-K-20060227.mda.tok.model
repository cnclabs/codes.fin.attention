table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the historical financial statements 
executive overview we engage principally in the business of owning and managing coal properties in the three major coal producing regions of the united states appalachia  the illinois basin and the western united states 
coal produced from our properties is burned in electric power plants located east of the mississippi river and in montana and minnesota 
as of december   we owned or controlled approximately two billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in eleven states 
for the year ended december   approximately of the coal produced from our properties came from underground mines and approximately came from surface mines 
as of december   approximately of our reserves were low sulfur coal 
included in our low sulfur reserves is compliance coal  which constitutes approximately of our reserves 
we lease coal reserves to experienced mine operators under long term leases that grant the operators the right to mine our coal reserves in exchange for royalty payments 
as of december   our reserves were subject to leases with lessees 
for the year ended december   our lessees produced million tons of coal generating million in coal royalty revenues from our properties and our total revenue was million 
our revenue and profitability are dependent on our lessees ability to mine and market our coal reserves 
generally  our lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell  subject to minimum monthly  quarterly or annual payments 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 
we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are recorded as deferred revenue  a liability on our balance sheet 
most of our coal is produced by large companies  many of which are publicly traded  with professional and sophisticated sales departments 
a significant portion of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
however  over the long term  our coal royalty revenues are affected by changes in the market price of coal 
coal royalty revenues from our appalachian properties represented of our total coal royalty revenues for the year ended december   and thus a significant portion of our total revenue is dependent upon appalachian coal prices 
coal prices are based on supply and demand  specific coal characteristics  economics of alternative fuel  and overall domestic and international economic conditions 
our lessees located in appalachia have recently experienced a greater demand for coal  and coal prices for both metallurgical and steam coal for those producers increased during and towards the end of the second quarter of  our appalachian lessees began to enter into new coal sales contracts at the higher prices 
as their older contracts have continued to rollover during the last months  we have received substantially higher royalties from our leases  and our revenue per ton from that region has increased to an average of per ton for the year ended december  from an average of per ton for the same period of however  because prices have generally stabilized over the last six months and our lessees will have fewer contracts that will rollover into substantially higher prices  we expect that our coal royalty revenue per ton will not continue to increase at this pace over the next year 
in addition  in spite of the higher prices  most of our lessees have not appreciably increased production due to a number of constraints  including a shortage of labor  permitting issues and rail transportation problems 
as a result  we believe that a larger percentage of our future revenue growth will come from acquisitions of new reserves 

table of contents for the year ended december   approximately of our coal royalty revenues and of the related production were from metallurgical coal  which was sold to steel companies in the eastern united states  south america  europe and asia 
prices of metallurgical coal have been substantially higher over the last two years and we expect them to remain at historically high levels in as well 
metallurgical coal  because of its unique chemical characteristics  is usually priced higher than steam coal 
the current pricing environment for us metallurgical coal is strong in both the domestic and seaborne export markets 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  we generated approximately of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  from rentals  royalties on oil and gas and coalbed methane leases  timber  overriding royalty arrangements  and wheelage payments  which are toll payments for the right to transport third party coal over or through our property 
under our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash each quarter 
because distributable cash flow is a significant liquidity metric that is an indicator of our ability to generate cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distributions paid to our partners  we view it as the most critical measure of our success as a company 
distributable cash flow is also the quantitative standard used in the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow represents cash flow from operations less actual principal payments and cash reserves set aside for scheduled principal payments on our senior notes 
although distributable cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  we believe it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under gaap 
distributable cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities 
distributable cash flow may not be calculated the same for nrp as for other companies 
a reconciliation of distributable cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities is set forth below 
reconciliation of gaap net cash provided by operating activities to non gaap distributable cash flow for the years ended december  cash flow from operations less scheduled principal payments less reserves for future principal payments add reserves used for scheduled principal payments distributable cash flow acquisitions acquisitions afg

table of contents critical accounting policies coal royalties 
we recognize coal royalty revenues on the basis of tons of coal sold by our lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments to us based on the greater of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal they sell  subject to minimum monthly  quarterly or annual payments 
these minimum royalties are generally recoupable over a specified period of time usually three to five years if sufficient royalties are generated from coal production in future periods 
we do not recognize these minimum coal royalties as revenue until the applicable recoupment period has expired or they are recouped through production 
until recognized as revenue  these minimum royalties are carried as deferred revenue  a liability on the balance sheet 
timber royalties 
we sell timber on a contract basis under which independent contractors harvest and sell the timber and  from time to time  in a competitive bid process involving sales of standing timber on individual parcels 
we recognize timber revenues when the timber has been sold or harvested by the independent contractors 
title and risk of loss pass to the independent contractors when they harvest the timber 
oil and gas royalties 
we recognize oil and gas royalties on the basis of volume of hydrocarbons sold by lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
generally  the lessees make payments to us based on a percentage of the selling price 
some leases are subject to minimum annual payments or delay rentals 
the minimum annual payments that are recoupable are generally recoupable over certain periods 
the minimum payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized either when the lessee recoups the minimum payments through production or when the period during which the lessee is allowed to recoup the minimum payment expires 
depreciation and depletion 
we depreciate our plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we deplete coal properties on a units of production basis by lease  based upon coal mined in relation to the net cost of the mineral properties and estimated proved and probable tonnage in those properties 
we estimate proven and probable coal reserves with the assistance of third party mining consultants  and we use estimation techniques and recoverability assumptions 
our estimates of coal reserves are updated periodically and may result in material adjustments to coal reserves and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
historical revisions have not been material 
timberlands are stated at cost less depletion 
we determine the cost of the timber harvested based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the amount of estimated net merchantable volume by geographic areas 
we estimate our timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
we update these estimates annually  which may result in adjustments of timber volumes and depletion rates that are recognized prospectively 
changes in these estimates have no effect on our cash flow 
ltip awards and new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  revised in  superseded apb no 
awards under our long term incentive plan have been accounted for on the intrinsic method under the provisions of apb no 
fas r  effective for the first quarter of  requires us to recognize a cumulative effect of the accounting change at the date of adoption based on the difference between the fair value of the unvested awards and the intrinsic value recorded 
additionally  fas r provides that grants after the effective date must be accounted for using the fair value method which will require us to estimate the fair value of the grant using an accepted method and charge the estimated fair value to expense over the service or vesting period of the grant 
fas r requires that the fair value be recalculated at each reporting date over the service or vesting period of the grant 
use of the fair value method as compared with the intrinsic method  will not change the total expense to be reflected for a grant but it may impact the period in which expense is reflected by increasing expense in one period based upon the fair value calculation and lowering expense in a different period 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact of fas r and expect to adopt it in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method

following the public sale of these subordinated units in  first reserve relinquished this contractual right 
however  one of the two first reserve appointees  steve smith  has remained on our board 
mr 
smith is an independent director and serves on our audit committee 
alex krueger  the other director appointed by first reserve  resigned from the board in december he is a managing director at first reserve  which during had investments in two of our lessees  alpha natural resources and foundation coal holdings 
because mr 
krueger also served on the boards of directors of alpha and foundation during  we have summarized below our relationships with each of these companies 
alpha natural resources 
we have entered into a number of coal mining leases with alpha through a combination of new leases entered into upon our purchase of the alpha property and through leases we had with entities that alpha acquired 
the alpha leases in general have terms of five to ten years with the ability to renew the leases for subsequent terms of five to ten years  until the earlier to occur of delivery of notice that the lessee will not renew the lease or all mineable and merchantable coal has been mined 
the leases provide for payments to us based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed minimum per ton of coal sold from the properties  with minimum annual payments 
under the alpha leases minimum royalty payments are credited against future production royalties 
coal royalty revenues earned under these leases for the year ended december  totaled million  representing of our total coal royalty revenues 
if no production had taken place in  minimum recoupable royalties of million would have been payable under the leases 
at december  we had accounts receivable outstanding of million with alpha natural resources 
we believe the production and minimum royalty rates contained in the alpha leases are consistent with current market royalty rates 
foundation coal holdings  inc foundation coal holdings  inc 
controls our lessee on the kingston and plum creek properties in west virginia  which contained approximately million tons of proven and probable reserves as of december  
table of contents the leases have terms of five to ten years with the ability to renew the lease for subsequent terms of five years unless the lessee gives notice it will not renew the lease 
the lease provides for payments to us based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed minimum per ton of coal sold from the properties  with annual minimum payments 
under the leases minimum royalty payments are credited against future production royalties 
we believe the production and minimum royalty rates contained in the leases are consistent with current market royalty rates 
coal royalty revenues earned under the leases for the year ended december  totaled million  representing of our coal royalty revenues 
if no production had taken place in  minimum recoupable royalties of  would have been payable under the lease 
at december   we had accounts receivable outstanding of million with foundation coal holdings  inc liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures we satisfy our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations 
since our initial public offering  we have financed our property acquisitions with the use of available cash  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and through the issuance of our senior notes and additional common units

our ability to satisfy any debt service obligations  fund planned capital expenditures  make acquisitions and pay distributions to our unitholders will depend upon our ability to access the capital markets  as well as our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

shelf registration on december   we and our operating subsidiaries jointly filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed sale of debt and equity securities 
securities issued under this registration statement may be in the form of common units representing limited partner interests in natural resource partners or debt securities of nrp or any of our operating subsidiaries 
the registration statement also covers  for possible future sales  up to  common units held by great northern properties limited partnership 
in november  great northern properties sold  common units in a private placement 
approximately million is available under our shelf registration statement 
the securities may be offered from time to time directly or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of any offering 
the net proceeds from the sale of securities from the shelf will be used for future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  including the retirement of existing debt 
we did not and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common units by great northern properties 
off balance sheet transactions we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and accordingly  there are no off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on operations for the years ended december   and environmental the operations our lessees conduct on our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
as an owner of surface interests in some properties  we may be liable for certain environmental conditions occurring at the surface properties 
the terms of substantially all of our coal leases require the lessee to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
lessees post reclamation bonds assuring that reclamation will be completed as required by the relevant permit  and substantially all of the leases require the lessee to indemnify us against  among other things  environmental liabilities 
some of these indemnifications survive the termination of the lease 
because we have no employees  employees of western pocahontas properties limited partnership make regular visits to the mines to ensure compliance with lease terms  but the duty to comply with all regulations rests with the lessees 
we believe that 
table of contents our lessees will be able to comply with existing regulations and do not expect any lessee s failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have neither incurred  nor are aware of  any material environmental charges imposed on us related to our properties for the period ended december  we are not associated with any environmental contamination that may require remediation costs 
however  our lessees do conduct reclamation work on the properties under lease to them 
because we are not the permittee of the mines being reclaimed  we are not responsible for the costs associated with these reclamation operations 
in addition  west virginia has established a fund to satisfy any shortfall in our lessees reclamation obligations 
we were also indemnified by western pocahontas properties limited partnership  great northern properties limited partnership  new gauley coal corporation and arch coal  inc  jointly and severally  until october  against environmental and tax liabilities attributable to the ownership and operation of the assets contributed to us prior to the closing of the initial public offering 
during  we notified western pocahontas properties limited partnership that we had been named in the pending flood litigation in west virginia and were reserving our rights under the indemnity 
in february  we were dismissed from this litigation and we expect no further claims against the indemnity 
the environmental indemnity is limited to a maximum of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below commodity price risk we are dependent upon the efficient marketing of the coal mined by our lessees 
our lessees sell the coal under various long term and short term contracts as well as on the spot market 
in previous years  a large portion of these sales were under long term contracts 
current conditions in the coal industry may make it difficult for our lessees to extend existing contracts or enter into supply contracts with terms of one year or more 
we estimate that of our coal is sold by our lessees under coal supply contracts that have terms of one year or more 
our lessees failure to negotiate long term contracts could adversely affect the stability and profitability of our lessees operations and adversely affect our coal royalty revenues 
if more coal is sold on the spot market  coal royalty revenues may become more volatile due to fluctuations in spot coal prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which are subject to variable interest rates based upon libor or the federal funds rate plus an applicable margin 
management intends to monitor interest rates and may enter into interest rate instruments to protect against increased borrowing costs 
at december   we had million outstanding in variable interest debt 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  annual interest expense would increase  assuming the same principal amount remained outstanding during the year
