included in the purchase were total assets of million  including million of investments and million of loans 
total liabilities assumed in the purchase were million  including deposits of million and million of borrowings 
in  horizon shifted the emphasis in lending from residential mortgage lending to more traditional commercial banking functions 
this shift continued in  and horizon was able to continue to diversify its revenue streams 
commercial loans grew to over million and consumer loans increased by to over million 
residential portfolio loans increased to over million and mortgage warehouse loans decreased to under million 
an improving local economy  strong sales effort and the addition of experienced lenders fueled the commercial growth 
the southwest michigan market continued to have its strong growth pattern 
consumer loans grew as a result of additional home equity lending in all markets and expansion of indirect lending into southwest michigan 
an increase of in deposits funded the increase in earning assets and provided liquidity to decrease borrowed funds by 
critical accounting policies horizon has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item on form k 
certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following as critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses  which is established through the provision for loan losses  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore evaluates it for adequacy each quarter 
management considers factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms  and estimated fair value of collateral that secures the loans 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different allowance for loan losses 
additional discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses is included the following analysis of financial condition 
goodwill and intangible assets management believes that the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill 
at december   horizon had core deposit intangibles of million subject to amortization and million of goodwill  which was not subject to amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets in the business acquired 
horizon s goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of horizon to provide quality  cost effective banking services in a competitive marketplace 
the goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
horizon has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired 
mortgage servicing rights servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through the sale of financial assets on a servicing retained basis 
capitalized servicing rights are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated regularly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying servicing rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates  original loan terms and whether the loans are fixed or adjustable rate mortgages 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve is recognized so that each individual stratum is carried at the lower of its amortized book value or fair value 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets was to increase in the future  horizon can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact horizon s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
analysis of financial condition investment securities horizon maintains a high quality investment portfolio with low credit risk 
investment securities totaled million at december   and consisted of u 
s 
treasury and government agency securities of million  municipal securities of million  mortgage backed securities of million  collateralized mortgage obligations of million  and corporate securities of thousand 
as indicated above  of the investment portfolio consists of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
these instruments are secured by residential mortgages of varying maturities 
principal and interest payments are received monthly as the underlying mortgages are repaid 
these payments also include prepayments of mortgage balances as borrowers either sell their homes or refinance their mortgages 
therefore  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have maturities that are stated in terms of average life 
the average life is the average amount of time that each dollar of principal is expected to be outstanding 
as of december   the mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations in the investment portfolio had an average life of years 
securities that have interest rates above current market rates are purchased at a premium 
these securities may experience a significant increase in prepayments when lower market interest rates create an incentive for the borrower to refinance the underlying mortgage 
this may result in a decrease of current income  however  this risk is mitigated by a shorter average life 
management currently believes that prepayment risk on these securities is nominal 
at december  and  all investment securities were classified as available for sale 
securities classified as available for sale are carried at their fair value  with both unrealized gains and losses added or subtracted  net of tax  directly to stockholders equity 
this accounting method adds potential volatility to stockholders equity  but net income is not affected unless securities are sold 
net depreciation on these securities totaled million  which resulted in a million reduction  net of tax  to stockholders equity at december  this compared to an thousand  net of tax  addition in stockholders equity at december  as a member of the federal reserve and federal home loan bank system  horizon is required to maintain an investment in the common stock of each entity 
the investment in common stock is based on a predetermined formula 
at december   horizon has investments in the common stock of the federal reserve and federal home loan bank totaling million compared to million at december  at december   horizon does not maintain a trading account and is not using any derivative products for hedging or other purposes 
loans total loans  the principal earning asset of the bank  were million at december  the current level of loans is an increase of from the december   level of million 
as the table below indicates  the increase is related to growth in all lending areas except for mortgage warehouse loans which declined during dollar percent december change change real estate loans family other total commercial loans working capital and equipment real estate  including agriculture tax exempt other total consumer loans auto recreation real estate home improvement home equity unsecured other total mortgage warehouse loans prime sub prime total grand total the acceptance and management of credit risk is an integral part of the bank s business as a financial intermediary 
the bank has established rigorous underwriting standards including a policy that monitors the lending function through strict administrative and reporting requirements as well as an internal loan review of consumer and small business loans 
the bank also uses an independent third party loan review function that regularly reviews asset quality 
real estate loans real estate loans totaled million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or of total loans as of december  this category consists of home mortgages that generally require a loan to value of no more than 
some special guaranteed or insured real estate loan programs do permit a higher loan to collateral value ratio 
in addition to the customary real estate loans described above  the bank also has outstanding on december   million in home equity lines of credit compared to million at december  credit lines normally limit the loan to collateral value to no more than 
these loans are classified as consumer loans in the table above and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
residential real estate lending is a highly competitive business 
as of december   the real estate loan portfolio reflected a wide range of interest rates and repayment patterns  but could generally be categorized as follows percent of percent of amount portfolio yield amount portfolio yield fixed rate monthly payment biweekly payment adjustable rate monthly payment biweekly payment total during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of residential mortgages were sold into the secondary market 
horizon anticipates that the volume of mortgage loan activity will remain fairly constant in overall mortgage activity is anticipated to decline  however  as horizon enters new markets  originations in these markets should offset the overall decline 
in addition to the real estate loan portfolio  the bank sells real estate loans and retains the servicing rights 
loans serviced for others are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the unpaid principal balances and number of loans serviced for others totaled approximately  and  and  and  at december  and  respectively 
the bank began capitalizing mortgage servicing rights during and the aggregate fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights at december   totaled approximately  comparable market values and a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows were used to estimate fair value 
for purposes of measuring impairment  risk characteristics including product type  investor type and interest rates  were used to stratify the originated mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights balances  january servicing rights capitalized amortization of servicing rights impairment allowance balances  december commercial loans commercial loans totaled million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or as of december  an improving local economy  a strong sales effort  the addition of experienced lenders and the alliance acquisition all contributed to the commercial growth 
commercial loans consisted of the following types of loans at december percent of percent of number amount portfolio number amount portfolio sba guaranteed loans municipal government lines of credit real estate and equipment term loans total consumer loans consumer loans totaled million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or as of december  the total consumer loan portfolio increased in the growth in consumer loans resulted from an increase in the number of automobile dealers from whom horizon buys loans 
growth also came in home equity lines of credit through increased marketing and a more competitive product 
mortgage warehouse loans in november  horizon began a mortgage warehousing program 
horizon enters into agreements with mortgage companies and purchases  at its discretion  mortgage loans from mortgage companies at par  net of certain fees  and later sells them back to the mortgage companies at the same amount and without recourse provisions 
interest income is recorded based upon a rate of interest tied to the prime rate during the funding period  not the rates on the individual note 
such loans are made to individuals and reviewed  prior to purchase  for evidence that the loans are of secondary market quality and meet horizon s internal underwriting guidelines 
an assignment of the mortgage to horizon is required 
in addition  horizon takes possession of the original note and forwards such note to the end investor 
in the event that the end investor would not honor this commitment and the mortgage companies would not be able to honor their repurchase obligations  horizon would then need to sell these loans in the secondary market at the fair value of these loans 
loans are typically resold within days and are seldom held more than days 
allowance and provision for loan losses critical accounting policy an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the identification of loans that may have potential losses is subjective  therefore  a general reserve is maintained to cover all potential losses within the entire loan portfolio 
horizon utilizes a loan grading system that helps identify  monitor  and address asset quality problems  in an adequate and timely manner 
each quarter  various factors affecting the quality of the loan portfolio are reviewed 
large credits are reviewed on an individual basis for loss potential 
other loans are reviewed as a group based upon previous trends of loss experience 
horizon also reviews the current and anticipated economic conditions of its lending market as well as transaction risk to determine the effect they may have on the loss experience of the loan portfolio 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding  compared to million or at december  during  the provision for loan losses totaled million compared to thousand in additionally  horizon added thousand to the allowance for homogeneous loan pools acquired through the alliance acquisition 
the allowance as a percent of total loans decreased due to strong credit quality and loan loss ratios which are better than those of horizon s peers 
however  no assurance can be given that horizon will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are significant in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the portfolio  will not require increases in the allowance for loan losses 
horizon considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  nonperforming loans nonperforming loans are defined as loans that are greater than days delinquent or have had the accrual of interest discontinued by management 
management continues to work diligently toward returning nonperforming loans to an earning asset basis 
nonperforming loans for the previous three years ending december are as follows nonperforming loans nonperforming loans total of the allowance for loan losses at december   compared to and of the allowance for loan losses on december  and  respectively 
a loan becomes impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is classified as impaired  the degree of impairment must be recognized by estimating future cash flows from the debtor 
the present value of these cash flows is computed at a discount rate based on the interest rate contained in the loan agreement 
however  if a particular loan has a determinable market value  the creditor may use that value 
also  if the loan is secured and considered collateral dependent  the creditor may use the fair value of the collateral 
smaller balance  homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include residential first mortgage loans secured by family residences  residential construction loans  automobile  home equity  second mortgage loans and mortgage warehouse loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of borrower operating results and financial condition indicate that underlying cash flows of a borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
often this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of days or more 
loans are generally moved to nonaccrual status when days or more past due 
these loans are often considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
other real estate owned oreo net of any related allowance for oreo losses for the previous three years ending december are as follows other real estate owned deposits the primary source of funds for the bank comes from the acceptance of demand and time deposits 
however  at times the bank will use its ability to borrow funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources when it can do so at interest rates and terms that are superior to those required for deposited funds 
total deposits were million at december   compared to million at december   or an increase of 
average deposits and rates by category for the pervious three years ended december are as follows average balance outstanding for average rate paid for the year the year ended december ended december noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits money market time deposits total deposits horizon continually revises and enhances its interest bearing consumer and commercial demand deposit products based on local market conditions and its need for funding to support various types of assets 
these product changes caused the changes in the average balances and rates paid as displayed in the table above 
certificates of deposit of  or more  which are considered to be rate sensitive and are not considered a part of core deposits  mature as follows as of december  due in three months or less due after three months through six months due after six months through one year due after one year interest expense on time certificates of  or more was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   horizon does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement  or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the company is a party under which the company has i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets

the plan is a comprehensive strategic plan to broaden and improve the market for horizon s common stock with local community investors who have a long term  personal interest in helping horizon remain an independent community bank 
it includes improved communications with stockholders and customers as well as efforts to improve the marketability of its common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  two important components of the shareholder value plan were completed

at december   million of the million in securities were not included in tier capital for regulatory purposes 
dividends on the trust preferred capital securities are recorded as interest expense 
the bank purchases home mortgages from mortgage companies under warehouse agreements whereby the mortgage company has the right to repurchase the loan 
because these transactions are sales of the loans to the bank and the bank is the owner of the purchased loans  the bank has historically treated these loans as home mortgage loans for call report and regulatory capital purposes 
during the course of the routine  periodic examination by bank regulatory authorities commenced in february  the examination personnel raised the issue of whether the bank s mortgage warehouse loans should be treated as other loans rather than as home mortgage loans for call report purposes 
if these mortgage loans were treated as other loans  it would change the calculations for risk based capital and reduce the bank s risk based capital ratios 
the following table shows  for year ends in  and the amount of the bank s risk based and tier capital ratios as reported and as they would be under this alternative treatment horizon bank and alternative minimum required to horizon bancorp as of reported treatment be well capitalized december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank if the bank is required to reclassify such loans  the bank still meets the regulatory well capitalized standards for all of  and bank regulators have not issued a final opinion on this matter but management continues to believe that these loans are properly characterized for risk based capital purposes 
however  there is no assurance that the regulators will concur with that determination 
if required to treat mortgage warehouse loans as commercial loans  the bank will consider increasing the amount of its capital through the issuance of subordinated debt  trust preferred securities or equity securities  or consider other alternatives 
as a condition of approval for the alliance acquisition  the occ required horizon bank to maintain regulatory capital ratios at basis points above the well capitalized minimums shown above 
as of december   management is not aware of any other recommendations by banking regulatory authorities  which  if they were to be implemented  would have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on horizon s liquidity  capital resources or operations

short term interest rates began to increase in the third quarter of and continued through after being relatively stable in horizon began to experience slightly higher loan yields due to the increase in short term rates throughout this is due in part to new loans and loan renewals coming in at higher rates than those maturing or paying off and rates on loans with variable rates rising with short term rates 
average loans outstanding during showed significant growth from due to the acquisition and concerted effort in new business 
the mix of the loan portfolio also showed significant change as shown in the following table 
commercial loans mortgage warehouse loans real estate loans installment loans total average loans outstanding average commercial loans grew nearly  consumer loans increased by over and residential real estate loans increased by over 
an improving local economy  strong sales effort and the addition of experienced lenders fueled the commercial growth 
the southwest michigan market  in which horizon increased market share through the acquisition of alliance  continued to have a strong growth pattern 
average consumer loans grew as a result of additional home equity lending in all markets and expansion of indirect lending into southwest michigan and north central indiana 
the continued decrease in mortgage refinancing caused mortgage warehouse loans to decrease by over 
to keep the bank s regulatory capital leveraged  the average investment portfolio was increased by 
increasing this category of earning assets causes a decline in the net interest margin as investment securities carry lower yields than loans  however  the increase in average loans outstanding was greater than the increase in average investments 
while reducing the net interest margin  increasing investment balances did have a positive impact on net income and earnings per share 
average interest bearing deposits increased by over during short term deposit rates increased throughout the year 
the overall cost of time deposits increased as maturing certificates of deposit renewed at higher rates 
the increase in net interest income during and is primarily the result of increased earning assets  particularly investment securities in and the loan portfolio in the increase in net interest income resulting from increased earning assets was offset by declines in the net interest margin 
noninterest income the major components of noninterest income consist of service charges on deposit accounts  gain on sale of loans and fiduciary fees 
service charges on deposit accounts are based upon a recovery of direct operating expenses associated with providing the service  b allowing for a profit margin that provides an adequate return on assets and stockholders equity and c competitive factors within the bank s markets 
service charges on deposits were million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
gain on sale of loans was million for compared to million in and million for in  horizon sold approximately of its residential mortgage loan production to the secondary market 
however  in and this percentage dropped to around and respectively as more customers took adjustable rate mortgages which are held in the bank s permanent portfolio of real estate loans 
during horizon sold million of current production of residential mortgage loans into the secondary market compared to million in and million in the gain includes approximately thousand from the sale of portfolio loans 
portfolio mortgage loans were sold to reduce the interest rate risk related to long term fixed rate assets and to provide funding for the growth in other loan areas 
horizon anticipates that the volume of mortgage loan activity will remain fairly constant in overall mortgage activity is anticipated to decline  however  as horizon enters new markets  originations in these markets should offset the overall decline 
fiduciary fees were million in compared to million in and million in the fluctuations are primarily due to changes in the market value of assets under administration and an increase in one time estate fees 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in salaries and benefits increased during compared to an increase of during the increase for related to the cost of expansion into new markets  including the acquisition of alliance  partially offset by declines in incentive compensation and commissions paid to mortgage originators 
the increase for also related to the cost of expansion into new markets partially offset by declines in incentive compensation and commissions paid to mortgage originators 
total other expenses  excluding salaries and benefits  increased in and 
in during other expenses were impacted by costs related to the acquisition of alliance as well as ongoing expenses relative to the operation of the additional branches  including the amortization of the core deposit intangible acquired in the acquisition 
during horizon reviewed all areas of noninterest expense and developed annual reductions of over thousand 
the more significant reductions included revisions to services provided by third parties  a change in check clearing vendors and real estate and personal property tax revisions 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  million in and million in the effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate in was due to a decline in the percentage of tax exempt income to pre tax income 
the decline in the effective tax rate in was caused by increased tax exempt income from bank owned life insurance and tax exempt investment income 
liquidity and rate sensitivity management management and the board of directors meet regularly to review both the liquidity and rate sensitivity position of horizon 
effective asset and liability management ensures horizon s ability to monitor the cash flow requirements of depositors along with the demands of borrowers and to measure and manage interest rate risk 
horizon utilizes an interest rate risk assessment model designed to highlight sources of existing interest rate risk and consider the effect of these risks on strategic planning 
management maintains within certain parameters an essentially balanced ratio of interest sensitive assets to liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
liquidity the bank maintains a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing relationships with consumers and local businesses 
these deposits are the principal source of liquidity for horizon 
other sources of liquidity for horizon include earnings  loan repayments  investment security sales and maturities  sale of real estate loans and borrowing relationships with correspondent banks  including the federal home loan bank fhlb 
at december   horizon has available approximately million in available credit from various money center banks  including the fhlb 
during  cash flows were generated primarily from proceeds from borrowings of million  increase in deposits of million and sales  maturities  and prepayments of investment securities of million 
cash flows were used to purchase investments totaling million  pay borrowings of million  and increase loans million 
the net cash and cash equivalent position increased by million during interest sensitivity the degree by which net interest income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates is monitored by horizon using computer simulation models  incorporating not only the current gap position but the effect of expected repricing of specific financial assets and liabilities 
when repricing opportunities are not properly aligned  net interest income may be affected when interest rates change 
forecasting results of the possible outcomes determines the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in horizon s balance sheet 
the goal is to manage imbalanced positions that arise when the total amount of assets that reprice or maturing in a given time period differs significantly from liabilities that reprice or mature in the same time period 
the theory behind managing the difference between repricing assets and liabilities is to have more assets repricing in a rising rate environment and more liabilities repricing in a declining rate environment 
at december  and  the amount of assets that reprice within one year were approximately of the amount of liabilities that reprice within the same time period 
rate sensitivity months months greater months and and than or less months year year total loans federal funds sold interest bearing balances with banks investment securities and frb and fhlb stock other assets total assets rate sensitivity months months greater months and and than or less months year year total noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowed funds other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap included in the gap analysis are certain interest bearing demand accounts and savings accounts 
these interest bearing accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal 
however  horizon considers approximately of these deposits to be insensitive to gradual changes in interest rates and generally to behave like deposits with longer maturities based upon historical experience 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk horizon s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk irr is the risk that horizon s earnings and capital will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
the primary approach to irr management is one that focuses on adjustments to the asset liability mix in order to limit the magnitude of irr 
horizon s exposure to interest rate risk is due to repricing or mismatch risk  embedded options risk  and yield curve risk 
repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequence from a change in interest rates that arise because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect horizon s assets and liabilities 
basis risk is the risk that the spread  or rate difference  between instruments of similar maturities will change 
options risk arises whenever products give the customer the right  but not the obligation  to alter the quantity or timing of cash flows 
yield curve risk is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will affect instruments of different maturities by different amounts 
horizon s objective is to remain reasonably neutral with respect to irr 
horizon utilizes a variety of strategies to maintain this position including the sale of mortgage loans on the secondary market and varying maturities of fhlb advances  certificates of deposit funding and investment securities 
the table  which follows  provides information about horizon s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table incorporates horizon s internal system generated data related to the maturity and repayment withdrawal of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for loans  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as the historical experience of horizon related to the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of residential loans and mortgage backed securities
