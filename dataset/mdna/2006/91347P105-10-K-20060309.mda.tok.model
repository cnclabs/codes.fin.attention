item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in section a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in a variety of flat panel display and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and 
back to contents commercial chemicals  technology development and evaluation agreements and license fees 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our oled technologies become more widely adopted by flat panel display manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may  under different assumptions and conditions  differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenues represent reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenues associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we also receive non refundable advance license and royalty payments under certain of our development and technology evaluation agreements 
these payments are classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees  which represents the cash received and recorded as a liability until such time revenue can be recognized 
payments that are not creditable to a license are recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement 
payments that are creditable to a license are deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no likelihood of executing a license agreement with the other party 
if a license agreement is executed  these payments will be recorded as revenues over the expected life of the licensed technology  otherwise  they will be recorded as revenues at the time negotiations with the other party show no further likelihood of success 
if we estimate differently the expected life of this licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period will differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred revenue and deferred license fees 
a portion of our license and royalty revenue is received from aixtron ag based on ovpd equipment sold by aixtron under our development and license agreement with them 
this revenue is recognized upon notification of equipment sold and acknowledgement of the royalties due from aixtron 

back to contents valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of these technologies may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or if such a write down is required in the future  it could be for up to  the net book value of our acquired technology as of december  valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which no compensation cost is recognized for options issued to employees at fair market value on the date of grant 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
sfas no 
requires that a company s financial statements include certain disclosures about stock based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for the plan 
we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
sfas no 
and eitf require that we record an expense for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants granted 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of making the disclosure required by sfas no 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including risk free interest rate  volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to increased revenues of  and an increase in interest income of  offset to some extent by an increase of  in operating expenses 
our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase resulted from our entering into additional government contracts during we commenced or continued working on government contracts in  of which four such contracts were started and completed during the year 
in addition  we completed work on three government contracts during  which had begun during prior years 
during  we commenced or continued working on government contracts  four of which had commenced during prior years 
we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our technology development and evaluation partners 
we commenced sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in 
back to contents we cannot accurately predict the timing of such purchases from customers due to the early stage of the oled industry 
our commercial chemical revenues and royalty and license fees for were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to the timing of purchases of our proprietary pholed materials for use in a commercial oled product by one of our customers 
all commercial chemical revenues in and were from the one customer 
the royalty and license fees in also included fees received under a patent license agreement executed with samsung sdi co 
in april  and a cross license agreement executed with dupont displays  inc in december in connection with each of these agreements  we received upfront payments of license fees and of royalties  both of which have been classified as deferred revenue and deferred license fees 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as license fee revenue over the life of the agreement for samsung sdi  and over ten years for dupont displays 
the deferred royalties in connection with the samsung sdi agreement will be recognized as products are sold and royalties are earned 
royalty and license fees in also included  of royalty revenue from the sale of ovpd equipment by aixtron ag  one of our licensees 
aixtron sold no such equipment in we recognized  in technology development revenue in in connection with technology development and evaluation agreements  compared to  for the same period in the increase is due to new technology development and evaluation agreements entered into in the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and evaluation services is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the oled industry 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributable to an increase of  in our operating costs  associated in large part with the expansion of our ewing  new jersey facility  an increase of  in charges in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  an increase of  in expenses related to the timing of stock and option issuances to our scientific advisory board  and increased patent legal costs of  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was due mainly to an increase of  in costs relating to personnel due to salary increases and increased healthcare costs  and an increase of  in expenses related to the timing of stock issuances to members of our board of directors  royalty expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly due to the minimum royalty requirement in the motorola agreement note and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under this agreement  we are required to make a minimum royalty payment at the end of the two year period ending december  of  as compared to  for the two year period ended december  interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this was the result of increased cash balances throughout due to our march registered offering of common stock  together with higher rates of return on investments during during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from the sale of these nols and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit

these actions were deemed dilutive under the terms of a warrant we had previously issued and resulted in the reduction of the exercise price of that warrant and an increase in the number of shares issuable under that warrant 
we treated this occurrence as a deemed dividend of  in  there were no actions deemed dilutive under the terms of this warrant 
in  the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock we issued to motorola  inc in september was adjusted in accordance with the certificate of designations for that stock 
we accounted for this adjustment as a contingent beneficial conversion feature cbcf 
as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  there were no such deemed dividends in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss attributable to holders of our common stock of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to increased revenues of  an increase in interest income of  an income tax benefit of  and a decrease in deemed dividends of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we earned  in contract research revenue from the us government in  compared to  in the increase in was primarily due to our commencement of work under seven new or continuing government contracts  and final billings on two phase i contracts and one subcontract 
in  our contract revenue was derived from eight government contracts  three of which were completed by the second quarter of and one which commenced in the third quarter of we earned  from our sales of oled materials for evaluation purposes in  compared to  for corresponding sales in the increase was mainly due to an increased volume of oled materials purchased for evaluation by potential oled display manufacturers  including our technology development and evaluation partners

back to contents the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and evaluation services is difficult to predict due to the early stage of the oled industry 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease of  in charges in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  offset in part by an increase in additional employees  salary increases and patent legal costs 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to increased salaries of  in connection with accruals for year end stock bonuses  and increased costs of  as a result of stock issuances to members of our board of directors for board and committee service 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this was the result of increased cash balances from our offerings of common stock in august and march during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols to new jersey under the technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  for the sale of these nols and recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit

as a result  we recorded the cbcf as a deemed dividend in the amount of  in september  we recorded a deemed dividend in the amount of  based on a similar adjustment to the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  short term investments of  and investments in certificates of deposit and other liquid instruments with an original maturity of more than one year of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of  was primarily due to  in funds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants during  less cash used in operations and for the purchase of equipment 
cash used in operating activities was  in  as compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to increased revenues of  and the timing of collections of accounts receivable  a  net increase in deferred license fees and deferred revenues which represent cash received and recorded as a liability until such time revenue can be recognized  and 
back to contents a  increase of non cash expenses associated with common stock and stock options issued in connection with our development and license agreement with ppg industries see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital decreased to  as of december   from working capital of  as of december  the reduction is primarily due to payments received in connection with deferred license fees and revenue  which is recorded as a liability until such time revenue is earned  and increased accrued expenses 
during  we paid off our debt of  which had been outstanding from the purchase of our ewing  new jersey facility  and we are no longer required to maintain restricted cash 
we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations through at least we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that would enable us to offer  from time to time  up to  of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities  subject to market conditions and other factors 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain and maintain patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that this additional funding will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap other obligations sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation      year total      year under our amended license agreement with princeton university and the university of southern california  we are obligated to pay minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect
