the company s products are used in demanding applications in medical equipment  hvac systems for trucks  busses and off road vehicles  the specialty automotive market  industrial automation  pumps  health fitness  defense  aerospace  semiconductor manufacturing  fiber optic based telecommunications  printing  and graphic imaging market sectors  to name a few 
today  five companies form the core of allied motion 
the companies  emoteq  computer optical products  motor products  stature electric and premotec offer a wide range of standard motors  encoders and drives for original equipment manufacturers oem and end user applications 
a particular strength of each company is its ability to design and manufacture custom motion control solutions to meet the needs of its customers 
the company has made considerable progress in implementing its new corporate strategy  the driving force of which is applied motion technology know how 
the company s commitment to allied s systematic tools  or ast for short  is driving continuous improvement in quality  delivery  cost and growth 
ast utilizes a tool kit to effect desired changes through well defined processes such as strategy deployment  target marketing  value stream mapping  material planning  standard work and single minute exchange of dies 
one of the company s major challenges is to maintain and improve price competitiveness 
the company s customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
in  the company began production of motor sub assemblies at a sub contract manufacturing facility in china 
during  the company made significant progress in establishing production of finished products in china  however was delayed in putting into production the programs that we expect will generate a significant profit swing for some of our projects 
we anticipate that we will be able to complete these programs in the company s products contain certain metals  and the company has been experiencing increases in the costs of these metals  particularly copper  steel and zinc  which are both key materials in our products 
the company has reacted by aggressively sourcing material at lower cost from asian markets  combining the sourcing of metals to benefit from volume purchasing and by passing on surcharges to our customers 
the company has an aggressive motor development plan for five new standalone products and two new product lines that leverage the combined technology base of the allied motion companies 
the company continues to focus on new product designs that design out cost  provide higher performance and meet the needs of our served markets 
early in  the company announced several new motor designs targeted at various markets 
each of these motors are targeted at precision motor applications 
it normally takes twelve months to get new products designed into new customer applications 
all product development efforts are focused on adding value for our customers in our served market segments 
management believes the strategy we have developed for the company will accomplish our long term goals of increasing shareholder value through the continued strengthening of the foundation necessary to achieve growth in sales and profitability

non gaap measures ebitda is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measures 
non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies 
ebitda is provided for information purposes only and should not be viewed as indicative of actual or future results

in june  allied motion received  for the issuance of  shares of common stock under the terms of a stock purchase agreement 
the purchasers of these shares were certain trusts and pension plans  the beneficiaries of which are michel robert and members of his immediate family 
the aggregate purchase price for the shares represented the fair value of the stock at the time the company received the purchase price 
cash was also provided from stock transactions under various employee benefit stock plans of  and  and repayment on a loan to the company s employee stock ownership plan of  and  in and respectively 
at december   the company had  of debt obligations representing borrowings on lines of credit  term loans and an overdraft facility 
under the domestic revolving line of credit agreement agreement  the company has available the lesser of a  or b the sum of of eligible trade accounts receivable excluding premotec and of eligible inventory  as defined in the agreement 
the line of credit expires in may  unless extended 
under the agreement  the company utilizes lock box arrangements whereby remittances from customers reduce the outstanding debt  and therefore the line of credit balance has been classified as a current liability 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rates plus as of december  
under the foreign line of credit agreement foreign agreement  the company has available the lesser of a eur million  or b of eligible trade accounts receivable of premotec as defined in the foreign agreement 
the line of credit expires in august  unless extended 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s base rate plus  with a minimum of at december  
under the foreign agreement  remittances from customers reduce the outstanding debt  therefore the balance has been classified as a current liability 
the eur  bank overdraft facility bears an interest rate equal to the bank s base rate plus  with a minimum of at december  
the facility has no expiration date 
the company also has various term loans obtained in connection with its acquisitions 
all borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
the loan agreements prohibit the company from paying dividends and require that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth and profitability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
as of december   the amount available under the lines of credit and overdraft facility was the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations and amounts available under the line of credit facilities 
the company believes the capital currently available to it is sufficient for its currently anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months 
if additional capital is needed in the future  the company would pursue additional capital via debt or equity financings 
a key component of the company s liquidity relates to the availability of amounts under its lines of credit 
any lack of availability of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity position 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies  lower costs of materials and surcharges passed on to customers 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies are reviewed on a regular basis 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on historical experience and judgments based on current economic and customer specific factors 
significant judgments are made by management in connection with establishing the company s customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  the company s customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
the company continues to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which may not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the company s customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company monitors and forecasts expected inventory needs based on sales forecasts 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if actual market conditions are significantly different from those projected by management the recorded reserve may be adjusted  and such adjustments may have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly  and in the past the company has recorded substantial charges for inventory obsolescence 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a fair value test to evaluate goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
as part of the review  the company estimates future cash flows 
depending upon future assessments of fair value and estimated future cash flows  there could be impairment recorded related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for certain domestic retirees and records the cost of the obligations based on estimates 
the net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the benefits 
several assumptions are used to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the future rate of compensation increases and health care cost increases 
the discount rate is selected based on a bond pricing model that relates to the projected future cash flows of benefit obligations 
actuarial assumptions used are based on demographic factors such as retirement and mortality 
actual results could vary materially from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pension or postretirement benefits 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of this statement will become effective in our first quarter of sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosure either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company will utilize the modified prospective method when it adopts sfas r 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s domestic and foreign lines of credit and its foreign term loan are variable based on the prime rate and euribor  and are effected by changes in market interest rates 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
a change in the interest rate of on the company s variable rate debt would have the impact of changing interest expense by approximately  annually 
foreign currency risk on august   the company completed the acquisition of premotec  located in the netherlands 
sales from this operation are denominated in euros  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the euro us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company
