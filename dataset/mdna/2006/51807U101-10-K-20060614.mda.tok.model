item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k report for the year ended march  forward looking statements 
for a discussion of the risk factors related to the company s business operations  please refer to the forward looking statements section starting at page of this report and the section entitled risk factors starting at page of this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  inventories  stock based compensation  warranties  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of optical cards  optical card drives and specialty cards and card printers 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement and there are no post shipment obligations other than warehousing under a us government subcontract or customer acceptance criteria 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns  and such provision is included in accrued liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the total amount of provision charged to warranty expense and product returns was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
actual warranty costs and returns activity was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s us government subcontract requires delivery into a secure vault located on company premises 
shipments are made from the vault on a shipment schedule provided by the prime contractor  which is subject to revision  but generally not subject to cancellation  at the option of the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered into the vault  title to the cards is transferred to the government and all risks of ownership are transferred as well 
the prime contractor is invoiced  with payment due within thirty days  and the contract does not contain any return other than for warranty or cancellation provisions 
pursuant to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue is recognized on delivery into the vault as the company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and the earnings process is complete 
if the company does not receive a shipment schedule for shipment of cards from the vault  revenue is deferred and recognized upon shipment from the vault 
in addition  revenue recognition for future deliveries into the vault would be affected if the us government cancels the shipment schedule through the prime contractor 
as a result  the company s revenues may fluctuate from period to period if the company does not continue to obtain shipment schedules under this subcontract or if the shipment schedules are cancelled 
emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf provides criteria governing how to identify whether goods or services that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer  b the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
in situations where the deliverables fall within higher level literature as defined by eitf  the company applies the guidance in that higher level literature 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables 
the company adopted eitf for any new arrangements entered into after july  and now assesses all revenue arrangements against the criteria set forth in eitf the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop no 
in applicable contracts 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead and allowable general and administrative expenses 
in circumstances where estimates of costs to complete a project cannot be reasonably estimated  but it is assured that a loss will not be incurred  the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin  rather than the completed contract method  is used until more precise estimates can be made 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the performance of a contract 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  the company recognized approximately  and  respectively  of revenues based on a zero profit margin related to a long term contract 
the company had no revenues generated from this type of contract for the year ended march  at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a contract with a middle eastern country to provide them with a full system integration of our optical memory cards for use in that country s personalized national id program which includes optical memory cards  hardware  and software 
the contract calls for multiple deliverables  installation  and certain client acceptance criteria  as defined in the agreement 
in applying the guidance within eitf  the company determined the deliverables are not to be accounted for as separate units  but rather as a bundled arrangement as the fair value of the undelivered items cannot be readily determined 
therefore  revenue recognition on this new contract and the associated contract costs were and will be deferred until the predominant undelivered element  the overview of card personalization  is delivered and accepted  commencing with the installation and client acceptance of the card personalization system 
total contract revenue will be recognized ratably based on actual cards personalized and accepted 
as of march   no revenue has been recognized under this contract  and costs incurred under the contract of million were recorded as deferred contract costs under the current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
license revenue  which may consist of up front license fees and royalty payments  is recognized as revenue when earned 
there were no costs or license revenue recorded in fiscal years  and the company entered into an agreement with global investments group gig  effective april   for the manufacturing of optical memory cards 
in accordance with eitf  the card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and ongoing support have been accounted for as one unit of accounting  since the company is unable to determine evidence of the fair value of any of the undelivered items 
accordingly  revenues for the arrangement have been deferred and will be recognized based on the predominant undelivered item  which is the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment over the remainder of the year license period 
pursuant to ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the agreement beginning when the equipment is accepted and training has been completed  which date is dependent on gig providing a facility in slovenia 
the company also defers direct and incremental expenses associated with building the card manufacturing equipment and with the delivery of other services for which revenue has been deferred  and the company will recognize these expenses as the company recognizes the related revenue 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of the company s software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
software revenue was immaterial for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  the company includes an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
the company determined in fiscal year that due to the company s recent cumulative tax loss history for the previous three year period  income statement loss history over the previous five quarters  and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues during the previous few quarters and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  that it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
as a result  the company determined that a full valuation allowance was required to net against its deferred tax assets in fiscal year and increased the existing allowance by million to million 
in addition  the company increased its valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset in the amount of million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year the fiscal year acquisition of challenge card design gmbh resulted in a deferred tax liability of  at march  and  at march the company s methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income  the estimated impact of future stock option deductions  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are based on near term projections and assumptions which management believes to be reasonable 
for recent prior periods through second quarter fiscal year  the company had been estimating future taxable income from its core business  which assumed on going business under the us government subcontract for permanent resident cards green cards and laser visa border crossing cards and the canadian government s permanent resident card program  as well as estimated operating expenses to support that level of business  as offset by the estimated impact of future stock option deductions 
starting with the third quarter of fiscal year  the company estimated future taxable income based upon its expectations for the current and next three years because this past core business has not proven to be as stable as the company had believed it to be and because this past core business is expected to represent an increasingly smaller part of the business 
this is because the company expected revenues from these us programs to stabilize at revenue levels lower than had been expected in the past and because the company expects new foreign business  which has fluctuated considerably quarter to quarter  to comprise a larger portion of the core business 
the company has had difficulty in the past  and expects to have continued difficulty in the future  in reliably forecasting its foreign business and the revenue to be received from it 
this  in combination with the anticipated three year cumulative tax loss for the period ended march   resulted in the company basing its estimates of future income for these purposes to booked orders only 
as circumstances change  the company may in the future be able to revert back to estimating future revenue based upon its forecast revenues rather than only using booked orders  although the company cannot say when this will occur 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required at the end of fiscal year and is still required at the end of fiscal year  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes from fiscal year through fiscal year other positive evidence included the level of sales and business experienced under the contract with the canadian government s permanent resident card program  prospects in italy and a middle eastern country for national identification card programs  the heightened interest in border security initiatives following the events of september   and expected future orders 
negative evidence included the company s reliance on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its business  the uncertainty in timing of anticipated orders from customers  the impact of future stock option deductions on taxable income  recent experience of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused through fiscal year  the financial statement loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year through the first two quarters of fiscal year  and the prior three years cumulative tax net operating losses 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  the company considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas no 
as well as the following risks dependence on vars and on a limited number of customers  lengthy sales cycles  technological change  and competition 
as described above  the company concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and as a result increased the valuation allowance to be equal to the full amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  and again at march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in the valuation allowance would be recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense or a credit to stockholders equity 
the company s net operating losses available to reduce future taxable income expire on various dates from fiscal year through fiscal year to the extent that the company generates taxable income in jurisdictions where the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses that have been offset by a full valuation allowance  the utilization of these net operating losses would result in the reversal of the related valuation allowance 
inventories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory less cost to sell 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasts of product demand 
demand for optical card drives can fluctuate significantly 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of certain read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the booked orders 
the company purchases drive parts for its anticipated demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
in addition  the company keeps a supply of card raw materials it deems necessary for anticipated demand 
management s analysis of the carrying value of card and read write drive inventory is performed on a quarterly basis 
with respect to inventory carrying values  the company follows the principles articulated in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance eg sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases 
as part of the company s quarterly excess obsolete inventory analysis  management also determines whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie  where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted  during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company did not record any significant lower of cost or market adjustments other than for read write drives in fiscal year in the amount of about  which is included as part of cost of product sales in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  the company did not record any significant lower of cost or market adjustment 
in those instances where the company has recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory  management ensures that such new cost basis is reflected in the statement of operations if that inventory is subsequently sold 
the company s inventory reserves are based upon the lower of cost or market for slow moving or obsolete items 
as a result  the company believes a increase or decrease of sales would not have a material impact on such reserves 
the company is currently evaluating sfas no 
inventory costs amendment of arb no 
 chapter  and does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
our balance sheet carries a variety of long lived assets including property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we undertake the impairment review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our review is based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 for other long lived assets  we periodically review the impairment of those assets 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset becomes its new accounting basis 
as it is prohibited  we do not reverse previously recognized impairment loss 
we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for fiscal year and the review of other long lived assets and concluded that there were no impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
if events or circumstances indicate that our estimates are no longer reasonable  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with fas and fas stock based compensation 
we have elected to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options because the alternative fair value method of accounting prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfs  accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
had we elected to follow sfas and to apply the fair value method to stock based employee compensation  we would have recorded an additional million in expense for the year ended march  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued their final standard on accounting for share based payments in fasb standard no 
r revised  share based payment fas r 
this statement replaces fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the statement is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after december  and requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
stock based payments include stock option grants under our stock plans 
the adoption of fas r could materially impact our results of operations 
warranties 
we have estimated reserves for product returns under warranty 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for existing products 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these product sales reserves are the most reasonably likely assumptions considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates 
if actual product returns are significantly different from our estimates  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
results of operations overview headquartered in mountain view  california  lasercard corporation manufactures lasercard optical memory cards and card related products  including chip ready opticalsmart cards 
in addition  the company operates a wholly owned german subsidiary acquired on march   challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh ccd  with offices in rastede and ratingen  germany  which manufactures advanced technology cards provides manufacturing capacity for certain steps of optical memory card production  and markets cards  system solutions  and thermal card printers 
the company completed the merger of cards more gmbh also acquired on march  into challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh in january in addition to using its own marketing staff in california  new york  washington dc area  and germany  the company utilizes value added reseller var companies and card distribution licensees  who generally have knowledge in specific markets  for the development of markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees consist primarily of the company s optical memory cards and optical card read write drives 
the company also offers for sale  its customized software applications and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  or signature to the cards 
these peripherals have not generated significant revenue for the company but have demonstrated various system options 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products as integrated solutions 
the company is continuing its efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive vars 
major near term growth potential for lasercard optical memory cards is in government sponsored identification programs in several countries 
since governmental card programs typically rely on policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that these programs will be implemented as expected or that they will include optical cards 
objectives for long term revenue growth include broaden the optical memory om products range to address lower end applications characterized by higher price sensitivity  diversify om products into  and effectively penetrate  industrial and commercial markets  expand hardware product offering to address new markets and add value to current offerings  and increase om product revenues by selling more application software and integrated solutions 
the table below presents condensed consolidated revenues  excluding inter company transactions  recorded by the us and german operations in thousands fiscal year us operations german operations revenues recorded by the us operations are generally to a small number of government customers located throughout the world 
revenues recorded by the german operations are mainly for a relatively large number of commercial customers 
historically  the largest purchaser of lasercard products has been a us government contractor  anteon international corporation anteon  a value added reseller var of the company 
anteon is the us government contractor for lasercard product sales to the us department of homeland security dhs  us department of state dos  us department of defense dod  and the government of canada 
under government contracts with anteon  the dhs purchases green cards and dos laser visa bccs  the dod purchases automated manifest system cards  and the canadian government purchases permanent resident cards 
encompassing all of these programs  the company s product sales to anteon represented  and of the total revenues for fiscal year  and another unaffiliated var  laser memory card spa of italy  accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for fiscal year   and mainly for secure id card programs in italy 
revenues for the major government programs are shown below as a percentage of total revenues fiscal year united states green cards and laser visa bccs canadian permanent resident cards italian carta d identit elettronica cie cards italian permesso di soggiorno elettronico pse cards for the government of italy  the company has received orders for cie cards carta d identit elettronica and pse cards permesso di soggiorno elettronico 
as card issuance infrastructure is more fully developed and the national id card system functions as designed  cie and pse card orders could ramp toward their full implementation level and could potentially result in annual revenues of million when these two national id programs are fully implemented 
backlog for these programs totaled million at march  and is deliverable through june the company believes that card revenue for these programs will amount to million to million in its fiscal year ending march  although no significant incremental shipments beyond the backlog are expected during the quarter ending june  us laser visa border crossing cards bccs and green cards for the us department of homeland security dhs are an important part of the company s revenue base 
for these programs  the company recorded card revenues of million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the company is currently delivering on orders placed prior to the expiration of a us government subcontract in november backlog at march  for these programs  which is deliverable through august  totaled million 
the company expects to receive a purchase order or a new subcontract prior to the last shipment under orders on hand although no assurance can be given 
for fiscal year  shipments under a subcontract for canada s permanent resident cards totaled million 
the backlog at march  was million deliverable through june the delivery rate is subject to increase or decrease by customer request 
for the fiscal year  the company recorded revenue of million for the national id card program in a middle eastern country  with all of the shipments made during the first six months of the fiscal year 
in january  the company entered into a separate million contract  for both the supply of secure national id cards for the same middle eastern government national id card program and the supply  installation and support of associated card personalization equipment  consumables and software 
deliveries are expected over approximately a one year period as the prime contractor elects to place a series of up to ten purchase orders 
the cards are being issued to adult citizens for national identity purposes and feature the latest advancements in identity theft protection provided by optical idlock  a combination of the highly secure lasercard optical memory technology and embedded hologramhd  the new high definition photographic quality etched image 
this subcontract is the first time that lasercard corporation has assumed responsibility for both supplying and installing personalization hardware  the oversight of the card personalization process  and the quality of the fully personalized cards  including the printing of cardholder information and encoding of data and the embedded hologramhd 
revenue will be recognized as cards are issued after personalization  but only after the entire infrastructure called for in the contract has been installed and accepted 
the company anticipates that this will be accomplished during the first six months of fiscal year the contract s first release valued at million was shipped prior to the end of fiscal year and is included in backlog until revenue is recorded 
revenue has not been recorded on this release and the cost of the items is included in deferred contract costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
effective april   the company sold a second source card manufacturing license  including equipment  training  and support  to the global investments group  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia and began receiving cash payments 
revenue on this arrangement will begin recognized over the remaining term of the agreement beginning when the equipment has been accepted and the training has been completed  which date is dependent on gig providing a facility in slovenia as discussed below under license fees and other revenues 
the company plans to invest up to million in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures at its facilities when forecasts justify the investment 
these expenditures could occur throughout the next twelve months  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march  the company s total revenues were million compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year product revenues 
the company s total revenues consisted of sales in its three segments of optical memory cards  optical card drives  drive accessories  and maintenance  and specialty cards and card printers  as well as in other miscellaneous items 
product revenues were million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year there were no license revenues earned in fiscal years   and the following table presents product revenue by segment in thousands  except for percentages fiscal year change change vs vs optical memory cards of total revenues optical card drives of total revenues specialty cards and card printers of total revenues other of total revenues total revenues the following table presents optical memory card revenue by major program in thousands fiscal year change change vs vs us green cards laser visas italian national id card programs canadian permanent resident cards national id cards in a middle eastern country vehicle registration in india all other programs total optical memory card revenues optical memory card revenue increased for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year due mainly to increases in card unit volume in the us and italian programs as well as increases in the other programs 
optical memory card revenue increased for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year due mainly to an increase in card unit volume in the italian program as well as increases in other programs except for a decrease in volume for canadian maple leaf permanent resident cards 
the company anticipates annual growth rates averaging in this segment over the next several years including the growth in fiscal year  driven by growth in current programs augmented by the addition of new programs 
there was no significant change in optical card drive revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the million decrease in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was due to the unusually large order for  drives for the us department of homeland security shipped during fiscal year the company does not anticipate that it will derive significant profits on future drive sales as prices are set near the manufacturing cost in order to promote optical memory card sales 
specialty cards and printers revenue of million in fiscal year was mostly unchanged from the million recorded in fiscal year  the first year the company operated in this segment 
the company anticipates growth of less than in this segment in fiscal year license fees and other revenues 
there were no license revenues during fiscal year  fiscal year or fiscal year the company sold a license  effective april   to global investments group gig  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia 
this agreement provides for payments to the company of million for a year license and five year training support package  followed by million paid million annually for ongoing support for an additional years 
additionally  the company is to sell approximately million worth of the required manufacturing equipment and installation support for the new facility to be built by gig to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually 
as of march   the company had acquired million of this equipment classified as equipment held for resale on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company has received million of payments called for in the agreements  consisting of a partial payment for the equipment and training of million and million for the license fee and support 
another approximately million is overdue with gig most recently committing to complete the payment by the end of june 
the company has begun to investigate alternative courses of action should gig fail to make such payment 
for the million the company received  million was recorded as advance payments from customer and million for the licensing fee was recorded as deferred revenue  which were both classified as long term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the million discussed above  gig is to pay the company royalties for each card produced under the license 
the territories covered by the license include most of the european union and eastern european regions 
gig has exclusive marketing rights in certain territories  with performance goals to maintain these rights 
the company will assign a person on site during the license term to assist with quality  security and operational procedures  with the mutual goal that the facility and the cards made in the facility conform to the company s standards 
the company also retains rights to utilize up to of the new facility capacity as backup and capacity buffer to augment its own card manufacturing facilities in mountain view  california and at its german subsidiary 
the granting of this license to gig establishes a potential second source supplier of optical memory cards for existing and prospective customers who may request multiple sources for cards 
the agreement contains various elements including a card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and ongoing support  and contingent payments for the sale of materials  and royalty payments for cards manufactured 
in accordance with eitf  the card manufacturing license  sale and installation of equipment  training  and ongoing support have been accounted for as one unit of accounting  since the company is unable to determine evidence of the fair value of any of the undelivered items 
accordingly  revenues for the arrangement have been deferred and will be recognized based on the predominant undelivered item  which is the ongoing annual support of the manufacturing equipment over the remainder of the year license period beginning when the equipment is accepted and training has been completed  which date is dependent on gig providing a facility in slovenia 
pursuant to ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts this revenue will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the agreement 
the company also defers direct and incremental expenses associated with building the card manufacturing equipment and with the delivery of other services for which revenue has been deferred  and the company will recognize these expenses as the company recognizes the related revenue 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled million scheduled for delivery in fiscal year  compared with million at march   and million at march  in addition  backlog for a bundled order of optical memory cards  read write drives  card printers  and software totaled million at march  the company has only a few customers who generally place orders for a several month period so that variations in order placement from a single customer can materially affect backlog 
as a result  the relative size of the company s backlog has not been a reliable indicator of future sales revenue trends 
the company has no significant backlog for read write drives 
in addition  the backlog for challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh as of march  for specialty cards and printers totaled million euros approximately million compared with million euros approximately million at march   and for a contract to develop a conventional non optical card production facility totaled million euros approximately million at march  compared with million euros approximately million at march  in circumstances where estimates of costs to complete a project cannot be reasonably estimated  but it is assured that a loss will not be incurred  the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin  rather than the completed contract method  is used until more precise estimates can be made 
therefore  revenue on the contract for a conventional non optical card production facility contract is being booked on a zero profit margin basis and the total profit under this contract will be booked at completion  probably during fiscal year gross margin the following table represents gross margin in absolute amount and percentage by segment in thousands  except for percentages fiscal year change change vs vs optical memory cards of optical memory card revenues optical card drives of optical card drive revenues specialty cards and card printers of specialty cards and card printers revenues other of other revenues nm nm nm total gross margin of total revenues optical memory cards 
optical memory card gross margin can vary significantly based upon changes in average selling price  production and sales volumes  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
unit volume affects gross margin due to the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase in optical memory card gross margin to of revenue for fiscal year as compared with of revenue for fiscal year is mainly due to the increase in production unit volume and increase in sales unit volume with minimal increase in fixed costs 
this was also augmented by increases in production efficiency and yields 
the sales unit volume increase for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year did not result in an increase in gross margin due largely to the increase in fixed costs to increase card manufacturing capacity for anticipated orders of cards made with the newly introduced sheet lamination process 
optical card drives 
except for the large read write drive order from the us government in the third quarter of fiscal year  read write drive gross profits have been negative  inclusive of fixed overhead costs  due to low sales volume and the company s policy to price drives close to manufacturing cost to promote card sales 
the company anticipates that read write drive negative gross margins will continue in the future unless sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs 
the company believes sales volume will increase during fiscal year resulting in a positive gross margin of about 
during fiscal year  the company incurred approximately million in costs to convert model to model q drives 
the negative gross profit decreased from year to year because there was no similar cost in fiscal year specialty cards and card printers 
the gross margin on specialty cards and card printers was in both fiscal year and fiscal year was the first year the company operated in this segment 
historically  the quarterly gross margin has ranged from to

the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical memory card features and structures  including various sheet lamination card structures  the insertion of contactless chips with radio frequency rf capability  optichip  ovd optically variable device products  and associated media development  enhanced optical memory card read write drives and read only drives readers  and new software products in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
for example  the company recently has developed a prototype of a lasercard handheld reader that is being evaluated by value added resellers 
the company anticipates that these ongoing research and engineering efforts will result in new or enhanced card capabilities  production model read only drives  or drives with advanced security features and lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development efforts will be successful 
these features are important for the company s existing and future optical memory card markets 
the decrease in r e spending for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was primarily due to the completion of major spending for the first prototype lasercard portable reader  coupled with being between phases of the new card media development project and the completion of card material and other projects 
the increase in r e spending for fiscal year compared with fiscal year was mainly due to r e expenditures by the acquired german entity 
increases in r e expenses are anticipated for fiscal year for development of production model read only drives  optical memory card media development  and other card and hardware related programs

income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  for fiscal year   for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year the company s income tax expense for fiscal year was primarily due to federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal year was mainly due to federal alternative minimum tax 
the payments from gig received during fiscal years and are recorded as income on the federal tax return even though they are not recorded as income under us generally accepted accounting principles 
this income has been offset by net operating loss carryforwards generated in previous years 
however  alternative minimum taxes are due on this income 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal year was due to increasing the valuation allowance to be equal to the remaining balance of the company s deferred tax asset 
the fiscal year income tax expense was not a cash item and did not mean that the company owed income taxes  but rather that it no longer could demonstrate that in the future it would likely be able to utilize the tax benefits of previously generated net operating losses 
the methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax asset is a critical accounting policy as described under the heading critical accounting policies under item in summary  this methodology considers positive and negative evidence regarding the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
due to the company s cumulative tax loss history for the three year period ending march   income statement loss history over the five quarters ended march   and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue which could lead to positive income on its financial statements and taxable income as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  the company determined it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset because its estimated future revenue taking into account only booked orders would not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets 
if the company has taxable income in the future  any unexpired net operating loss income tax carry forward amounts will be utilized to reduce otherwise required income tax payments  and future tax expense  up to the full amount of the net deferred tax asset which is currently million 
in future years  unless the valuation allowance is reduced  should the company be profitable for income tax purposes  the company will utilize its available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the income tax it would otherwise owe  meaning that its federal effective tax rate will be zero except for alternative minimum taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
the company invests its cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
in doing so  the company seeks primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of its capital and  secondarily  to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  the company invests only in debt securities issued by a the us treasury and us government agencies  state agencies and corporations and b debt instruments that meet the following criteria o commercial paper rated a p or debt instruments rated aaa  as rated by the major rating services o can readily be sold for cash investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
there were no material changes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the following summarizes short term investments at fair value  weighted average yields and expected maturity dates as of march  in thousands fiscal year auction rate securities weighted average yield us government and agency obligations weighted average yield total investments there were no long term investments as of march  foreign currency exchange rate risk

to date an immaterial amount of sales have been denominated in euros 
in addition  some raw material purchases and purchased services are denominated in euros 
as of march   the outstanding balance of a debt relating to the acquisition of challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh ccd was immaterial 
accordingly  the exchange rate risk related to this debt is minimal 
since acquisition  cash provided by used in ccd s operating activities has been immaterial 
the company uses short term foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated primarily with inter company payables  account  and loan receivables denominated in euros to its german subsidiaries 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated for accounting purposes as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the forward contract are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated inter company payable  account  and loan receivables 
at march   we had a foreign exchange forward contract with a maturity of less than days to purchase million euros 
the fair value of the forward contract was not material at march
