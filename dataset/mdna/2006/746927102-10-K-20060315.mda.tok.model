item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report  you should consider carefully the following factors  which describe the risks  uncertainties and other factors that may materially and adversely affect our business  products  financial condition and operating results 
we are identifying these as important factors that could cause actual events or our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities reform act of and forward looking information within the meaning of canadian securities legislation made by us or on our behalf in this annual report or elsewhere 
the risks described below are not the only ones that may exist 
additional risks not currently known by us or that we consider immaterial at the present time may also impair our business operations and financial condition 
we are relying upon the safe harbor for forward looking statements and information and any such statements are qualified by reference to the cautionary statements set out elsewhere in this annual report 
risks relating to our business we face new competition for visudyne 
we may not be successful in addressing competition for visudyne  eligard or our other products 
we may be unable to contend successfully with current or future competitors 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
our competitors include major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  many of which have access to financial  technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours and substantially greater experience in developing and manufacturing products  conducting preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals 
we are aware of a number of competitors and potential competitors to our products and the impact on the sales of our products and our revenue from the sales of our products may be material 
some of these competitors are also our collaborators 
for example  novartis ophthalmics  who has the marketing rights to our product visudyne  has also acquired rights to market lucentis outside of north america  a product that when approved will be competitive with visudyne 
the following are examples of competitors to certain of our approved proprietary products visudyne competition there are a number of competitive products to visudyne that are approved  pending approval or in development 
these competitors include genentech and novartis ophthalmic s lucentis which is currently pending regulatory approval in the us and europe  genentech s avastin which is approved for cancer but is being used off label extensively by physicians for the treatment of wet amd  eyetech now part of osi pharmaceuticals  inc and pfizer s macugen which is approved in the us and europe for the treatment of all forms of wet amd  and alcon s retaane which is the subject of an approvable letter in the us which we expect means that alcon may need to conduct further studies prior to obtaining registration in the us and is approved in australia 
in addition  genaera corporation  regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc  allergan sirna therapeutics and genvec inc 
are also developing or may develop competitive therapies targeted for wet amd employing different technologies 
we also believe that visudyne could be competing against surgical or other treatments for amd  including macular translocation  submacular surgery and laser photocoagulation  among others 
eligard competition there are a number of approved products on the market with which our eligard products compete 
these include astrazeneca s zoladex product  bayer pharmaceuticals corporation s viadur product  watson pharmaceuticals  inc s trelstar product and tap pharmaceuticals  inc s lupron product 
aczone competition upon commercialization  our aczone product will directly compete against several other prescription topical products for the treatment of acne 
these include  but are not limited to  erythromycin benzoyl peroxide  clindamycin benzoyl peroxide  tretinoin  and adapalene products 
aczone will also compete indirectly with systemic prescription products and topical over the counter therapies 
in addition  we face competition on all of our generic dermatology products  although none of the generic dermatology products are individually material to our business 
we are aware of other products manufactured or under development by competitors that are used for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases that we have targeted for product development 
the existence of these products  or other products or treatments of which we are not aware  or products or treatments that may be developed in the future  may adversely affect the marketability of our products 
more information on the competitors and potential competitors can be found under item business competition 
if there is an adverse outcome in the ongoing patent litigation with tap pharmaceuticals  inc or any other litigation or other legal actions in which we are or may become involved our business may be harmed 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are or may become involved in various types of litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
we are currently a defendant in four lawsuits filed against us 
in one lawsuit which was commenced in the us by tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plantiffs  we recently lost the trial court decision and intend to appeal this decision 
the us tap litigation began in when tap and its co plaintiffs sued atrix laboratories  inc now our subsidiary  qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo alleging that qlt usa s eligard product infringes their patent  which expires on may  in the tap litigation  a jury upheld the validity of the patent and the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division denied defendants defense that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by the patentees before the us patent and trademark office 
the discovery and pre trial phase for the damages portion of the trial is scheduled to begin in qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo intend to appeal the adverse judgment to the court of appeals 
under the marketing agreement entered into between qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo under which sanofi synthelabo commercializes our eligard products in the us and canada  qlt usa has provided certain indemnities to sanofi synthelabo and its affiliates  including indemnities covering certain losses relating to infringement of a third party s patent rights 
while we cannot currently estimate the potential damages in the tap litigation in the event that qlt usa is unsuccessful in its appeal  or what level of indemnification  if any  will be required under the marketing agreement with sanofi synthelabo  the amount could be substantial  which could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of qlt usa and consequently  on qlt inc and our business 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive verdicts do occur which may include a judgment with significant monetary award  including the possibility of punitive damages  a judgment that certain of our patent or other intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable and  as has occurred in the us litigation with tap pharmaceuticals  the risk that an injunction could be issued preventing the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products that are the subject of the litigation 
furthermore  we will have to incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits and the time demands of these lawsuits could divert management s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any particular period 
for further details of the litigation with tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plaintiffs and the current status of our other intellectual property litigation  please refer to item legal proceedings 
sales of eligard may be adversely affected as a result of the ongoing patent litigation with tap pharmaceuticals  inc in connection with the ongoing patent litigation with tap pharmaceuticals  inc  our marketing partner for eligard  sanofi synthelabo has suspended the sale of eligard in the united states from early march until may  in addition to lost sales for that period prior to may   the future market for eligard in the united states and elsewhere may be adversely affected by the temporary withdrawal of eligard from the market 
we cannot predict whether after recommencing sales of eligard on may  sanofi synthelabo will be successful in regaining the market position and sales revenue for eligard that it had achieved prior to the withdrawal 
as a result  our revenues and royalty income may be adversely affected both during the period prior to may  and thereafter and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  in the event that the court of appeals does not grant qlt usa s motion for a permanent stay of the injunction order issued by the district court  which has temporarily been stayed by the court of appeals  qlt usa will be prevented from manufacturing and selling eligard to its licensees and distributors outside of the us until the expiry of the tap patent on may  in the event that we are unable to supply eligard to our licensees and distributors prior to the expiry of the injunction  the sales of eligard in those countries may be adversely impacted during that period and thereafter 
as a result  our revenues and royalty income may be adversely effected both prior to may  and thereafter and this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see item legal proceedings 
we are dependent on third parties to market visudyne and eligard 
we are dependent on other third parties for the research  development  and commercialization of our products 
our strategy for the development and commercialization of our products includes entering into various arrangements with third parties and therefore is dependent on the subsequent success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities under such arrangements 
a significant portion of our revenue depends on the efforts of novartis ophthalmics to market and sell visudyne 
if novartis ophthalmics does not dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of visudyne  or if novartis ophthalmics fails in its marketing efforts  or if marketing and distribution expenses are excessive  the revenues we receive from the sale of visudyne would decrease and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  the terms of our agreement with novartis ophthalmics do not restrict novartis ophthalmics from commercializing  whether by itself or in collaboration with third parties  non pdt products that could be competitive with visudyne 
novartis entered into a license arrangement with genentech  inc in which novartis ophthalmics has licensed the rights outside of north america to lucentis  a product that is pending regulatory approval for the treatment of wet amd  and is expected to be a competing product to visudyne 
the agreement between us and novartis ophthalmics pursuant to which novartis opthalmics markets and sells visudyne has a term extending to and may be terminated by novartis ophthalmics upon a default of the agreement by us without cause or on days notice to us 
we have formed strategic relationships with a number of other collaborators to help us commercialize and market eligard and our generic dermatology products 
our revenues from eligard and our generic dermatology products are dependent on the efforts of our marketing partners in promoting and selling those products 
if those partners do not dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of our products  the revenues we receive from sales of those products would decrease and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
although we believe that parties to our collaborative arrangements have an economic incentive to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities generally are not under our control 
we cannot predict whether such parties will perform their obligations as expected or whether significant revenue will be derived or sustained from such arrangements 
to the extent such parties do not perform adequately under our various agreements with them  the development and commercialization of our products may be delayed  may become more costly to us or may be terminated  and may require us to expend significant amounts of time and money to find new collaborators and structure alternative arrangements 
disputes with a collaborator could delay a program on which we are working with the collaborator and could result in expensive arbitration or litigation  which may not be resolved in our favor 
the success of visudyne  eligard and our other products may be limited by governmental and other third party payers 
the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may negatively affect the sale of visudyne  eligard and our other products 
our ability to commercialize visudyne and our other products successfully will depend in part on the timeliness of and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments is obtained from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations in the us and foreign markets 
product sales  attempts to gain market share or introductory pricing programs of our competitors could require us to lower our prices  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be unable to set or maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic products or newly approved product indications 
in both the united states and some non us jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
in the united states  new legislation may be proposed at the federal and state levels that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
effective january  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  or mma  changed the methodology used to calculate reimbursement for drugs such as visudyne and eligard that are administered in physicians offices in a manner intended to reduce the amount that is subject to reimbursement 
in addition  beginning in january  the legislation directs the secretary of the department of health and human services  or hhs  to contract with procurement organizations to purchase physician administered drugs from the manufacturers and provides physicians with the option to obtain drugs through these organizations as an alternative to purchasing from the manufacturers  which some physicians may find advantageous 
these changes may also cause private insurers to reduce the amounts that they will pay for physician administered drugs 
in addition  the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the agency within hhs that administers medicare and is responsible for reimbursement of the cost of visudyne and eligard  has asserted the authority of medicare not to cover particular drugs if it determines that they are not reasonable and necessary for medicare beneficiaries or to cover them at a lesser rate  comparable to that for drugs already reimbursed that cms considers to be therapeutically comparable 
further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely 
our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the medicare prescription drug coverage legislation  by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other healthcare reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future 
there can be no assurance that any of our applications or re applications for reimbursement for any of our products will result in approvals or that our current reimbursement approvals for visudyne  eligard and our other products will not be reduced or reversed in whole or in part 
if we were to have reimbursement reduced or reversed  the market for the affected product may by materially impaired and could materially harm our business and future revenues from that product 
for example  while we expect that the results seen in the visudyne in occult  or vio  study did not contradict results seen in prior studies  because the vio study failed to meet its primary endpoint  there is a risk that reimbursement for visudyne in the occult form of wet amd could be re evaluated in the us  europe and elsewhere by the applicable governmental authorities 
if they were to reduce or reverse prior reimbursement decisions for visudyne in the occult form of wet amd  this could materially adversely affect our future sales and revenue from visudyne 
we may not successfully develop and launch replacements for our products that lose patent protection 
most of our products other than our generic dermatology products are covered by patents that give us a degree of market exclusivity during the term of the patent 
a description of the key patents protecting visudyne  eligard  atrigel and our other late stage products are set out in item under the heading patents  trademarks and proprietary rights 
upon patent expiration  our competitors may introduce products or  in the case of atrigel  drug delivery technology  using the same technology 
as a result of this possible increase in competition  we may need to charge a lower price in order to maintain sales of our products or may lose a competitive advantage and marketability of our atrigel drug delivery technology which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to develop and successfully launch new products prior to the expiration of patents for our existing products  our revenue from those products could decline significantly 
we may not be able to develop and successfully launch more advanced replacement products and or drug delivery technologies before these and other patents expire 
we may not be able to obtain and enforce effective patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by competitors  and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay to use required technology 
we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents  to maintain trade secret protection for our technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business 
we have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain aspects of visudyne  eligard and our other products and technology 
such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide us with a preferred position with respect to any product or technology 
it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully 
in that event  to the extent a preferred position is conferred by such patents  any preferred position held by us would be lost 
if we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position  visudyne and our other products could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products 
in addition  we have an exclusive worldwide license from the university of british columbia  or ubc  see patents  trademarks and proprietary rights above for all of the patents and know how owned by ubc relating to verteporfin  lemuteporfin and certain additional photosensitizers and their use as therapeutics or diagnostics 
under our license agreement with ubc  if we fail to make any required payments to ubc  it would have the right to terminate these licenses 
under our license agreement with massachusetts general hospital  or mgh  it would have the right to terminate the license if we defaulted under the agreement and failed to cure such default within days 
patents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of other parties 
the cost of enforcing our patent rights against infringers  if such enforcement is required  could be significant  and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations 
it is also possible that a court may find us to be infringing validly issued patents of third parties 
in that event  in addition to the cost of defending the underlying suit for infringement  we may have to pay license fees and or damages and may be enjoined from conducting certain activities 
obtaining licenses under third party patents can be costly  and such licenses may not be available at all 
under such circumstances  we may need to materially alter our products or processes or may lose the right to continue to manufacture and sell a product entirely for a period of time 
unpatented trade secrets  improvements  confidential know how and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and commercial success 
although we attempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners  collaborators  employees and consultants and other appropriate means  these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information  and  in any event  others may develop independently  or obtain access to  the same or similar information 
resources devoted to research and development may not yield new products that achieve commercial success 
we devote substantial resources to research and development 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of a new product  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between eight and fifteen years or more for a pharmaceutical product 
each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required for us to market such products successfully 
we can make no assurances that any of the products currently in our development pipeline will be commercially successful 
the incidence of wet amd might be reduced if therapies currently in development or currently available prevent or reduce the risk of development of wet amd which could adversely impact the sales of visudyne 
we are aware that alcon has initiated a phase iii clinical trial to evaluate the use of retaane anacortave acetate as a treatment for patients with the dry form of amd who are at high risk of developing wet amd  with the objective of preventing the occurrence of wet amd 
we are also aware of published reports of studies showing that supplemental vitamin therapies reduce the risk of development of wet amd 
if these studies show that new therapies are effective or if supplemental vitamin usage becomes common place in patients with dry amd  the incidence of wet amd  which often develops in patients initially diagnosed with dry amd  might be reduced  and visudyne sales and our revenues could be materially reduced 
we may be unable to manufacture or continue to manufacture efficiently visudyne or our other products in compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements or our product specifications 
we depend on several third parties in the us  canada  europe and japan to manufacture visudyne  and if such third parties fail to meet their respective contractual commitments  we may not be able to supply or continue to supply commercial quantities of the product or conduct certain future clinical testing 
we are dependent upon raylo chemicals inc  nippon fine chemicals  parkedale pharmaceuticals inc  orgapharm sas and hollister stier laboratories llc to manufacture visudyne or components thereof 
the agreement between us and raylo chemicals is in effect for a term ending january   after which it will renew for a further two years unless one party provides the other with months advance notice of its intention not to renew  which has not occurred at this time 
our agreement with nippon fine chemicals is in effect for a term ending on january  our agreement with parkedale pharmaceuticals inc is in effect for a term expiring december  the agreement with orgapharm is effective for a period of years from the date of commercial approval of the visudyne component by either the eu regulatory authorities  or the us and the canadian regulatory authorities  whichever is earlier 
the agreement with hollister stier is in effect for years from the date of applicable regulatory approval for the component product  after which it will renew for additional year periods unless one party provides the other with months advance notice of its intention not to renew 
although none of these agreements is terminable by the other party for convenience  if we were to commit a default under or breach of any of such agreements  the other party could terminate such agreement 
we may be unable to renew such agreements after their expiry on terms which are commercially acceptable to us 
our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize visudyne and our other products  either directly or in conjunction with others  depends  in large part  on our ability to have such products manufactured at a competitive cost and in accordance with fda and other regulatory requirements as well as our product specifications 
our contract manufacturers manufacturing and quality procedures may not achieve or maintain compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory standards or product specifications  and  even if they do  we may be unable to produce or continue to produce commercial quantities of visudyne and our other products at an acceptable cost or margin 
if current manufacturing processes are modified  or the source or location of our product supply is changed voluntarily or involuntarily  regulatory authorities will require us to demonstrate that the material produced from the modified or new process or facility is equivalent to the material used in the clinical trials or products previously approved 
any such modifications to the manufacturing process or supply may not achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements or our product specifications 
in many cases  prior approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any changes can be instituted 
if our manufacturers produce one or more product batches that do not conform to fda or other regulatory requirements  or our product specifications  or if they introduce changes to their manufacturing processes  our manufacturing expenses may increase materially  our product inventories may be reduced to unacceptable levels and or our ability to meet demand for visudyne may be detrimentally impacted  possibly materially 
in the field of photodynamic therapy  or pdt  we are dependent on the success and continued supply of third party medical device companies with complementary light source and light delivery devices by third party suppliers 
we currently depend on three third party suppliers  carl zeiss meditic  lumenis and biolitec  inc  to provide the laser light delivery devices for visudyne therapy and to service such devices 
because pdt requires a light source  and in some instances a light delivery system  to be used in conjunction with our photosensitizers  we are dependent on the success of these medical device companies in placing and maintaining light sources with the appropriate medical facilities  in distributing the light delivery systems and servicing such systems as required 
carl zeiss meditic and lumenis supply such lasers to treating physicians directly  and neither qlt nor novartis ophthalmics has a supply or distribution agreement with either carl zeiss meditic or lumenis for the supply of such devices 
the relationship between our company and novartis ophthalmics and such suppliers  under which we and novartis ophthalmics provides support and assistance to such suppliers  is an informal collaboration only 
we have entered into a supply agreement with biolitec for the supply of lasers for distribution by us but delivery of the first shipment of lasers is not expected until the second quarter of  consequently  we have not yet begun distribution of the lasers 
if one or more of the medical device companies with whom we and novartis ophthalmics have such collaborations cease to carry on business  or if they no longer supply complementary light sources or light delivery systems or if they or we are unable to achieve the appropriate placements of light sources and ensure an uninterrupted supply and ongoing maintenance of light delivery systems to treating physicians  sales of visudyne and our revenues from the sale of visudyne may be adversely affected 
the expected lifecycle of the laser light delivery devices for visudyne therapy is approximately five to eight years 
therefore  in the coming years  we expect that many of these lasers will need significant upgrades or will need to be replaced 
customers may decide not to invest in purchasing a new laser in light of emerging competitive therapies which do not require a medical device and this could negatively impact our future sales  possibly materially 
we have limited experience in manufacturing products on a commercial scale and are subject to ongoing regulatory compliance requirements 
qlt usa completed the expansion of our manufacturing facility in the second quarter of validation of the plant and equipment was completed during the third quarter of certain areas of the plant were qualified by the fda in we manufacture eligard at this facility 
even though we have obtained fda and other regulatory approval to do so  our manufacturing processes are subject to ongoing review and approval by regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which our products are sold 
if we modify our current manufacturing processes  the fda and other regulatory authorities will require us to demonstrate that the material produced from the modified or new process or facility is equivalent to the material used in the clinical trials or products previously approved 
any such modifications to the manufacturing process or supply may not achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements or our product specifications 
in many cases  prior approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any changes can be instituted 
in addition  later discovery of problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such products or processes  including potential withdrawal of eligard or other products from the market 
if regulatory authorities determine that we have violated regulations or if they restrict  suspend or revoke our prior approvals  they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling eligard or other products until we comply  or indefinitely 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate  then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it 
if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to produce enough eligard or the other products which we manufacture to meet market demands  this could cause a decrease in revenue 
there is also a risk that our manufacturing capabilities may not be sufficient to meet market demands for eligard or that we may experience a disruption in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  if we produce eligard product batches which do not conform to fda or other regulatory requirements  or our product specifications  our manufacturing expenses may increase materially  our eligard product inventories may be reduced to unacceptable levels  or we may be unable to meet demand for eligard 
in such events  our business would be harmed materially 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers involved in the production of our eligard products 
we currently outsource the sterile filling and lyophilization  also known as freeze drying  process of our eligard products designated for shipment outside of the us to chesapeake biological laboratories  inc  an approved contract manufacturer  and rely on this manufacturer for this highly specialized service 
we have built our own sterile filling and lyophilization facility that received fda approval to manufacture commercial product in december and is now the asceptic facility for the filling and lyophilization of the eligard products for the us market  with chesapeake biological laboratories as the secondary facility for filling and lyophilization of the eligard products for the us market 
our contract with chesapeake biological laboratories is for a period of two years commencing january   and automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party provides notice on non renewal more than days prior to termination  which has not occurred at this time 
if our relationship with chesapeake biological laboratories was to deteriorate or terminate  production of our eligard products designated for shipment outside of the us  supply may be temporarily discontinued for several months 
we currently have one other contract manufacturer as a back up source for the sterile filling and lyophilization process 
however  the fda would need to approve the change in the manufacturer of the sterile filling and lyophilization process for our eligard products  which could take several months and result in a material loss of revenue 
if our supply of finished products is interrupted  our ability to maintain our inventory levels could suffer and future revenues may be delayed 
we try to maintain inventory levels that are no greater than necessary to meet our current projections 
any interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to timely distribute finished products 
if we are unable to obtain adequate product supplies to satisfy our customers orders  we may lose those orders and our customers may cancel other orders and seek monetary compensation if permitted under the agreement with the customer stock and sell competing products 
this in turn could cause a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues 
supply interruptions may occur and our inventory may not always be adequate 
numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply of our finished products including shortages in raw material required by our manufacturers  changes in our sources for manufacturing  our failure to timely locate and obtain replacement manufacturers as needed and conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials 
we may face future product liability claims that may result from the sale of visudyne  eligard and our other products 
the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of human pharmaceutical products entail significant inherent risks of allegations of product liability 
our use of such products in clinical trials and our sale of visudyne  eligard and our other product candidates may expose us to liability claims allegedly resulting from the use of these products 
these claims might be made directly by consumers  healthcare providers or others selling our products 
we carry clinical trials and product liability insurance to cover certain claims that could arise during the clinical trials for our product candidates or during the commercial use of visudyne  eligard or our other products 
such coverage  and any coverage obtained in the future  may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim  and we may not be able to increase the amount of such insurance or even renew it 
a successful product liability claim could materially harm our business 
in addition  substantial  complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations 
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in identifying  negotiating or integrating future acquisitions  business combinations or strategic alliances 
from time to time  we may engage in negotiations to expand our operations and market presence by future product  technology or other acquisitions and business combinations  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies 
we may not be successful in identifying  initiating or completing such negotiations 
competition for attractive product acquisition or alliance targets can be intense  and there can be no guarantee that we will succeed in completing such transactions on terms that are acceptable to us 
even if we are successful in these negotiations  these transactions create risks  such as the difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business  the potential disruption to our ongoing business  and the potential negative impact on our earnings 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks 
if we are not successful  our business could suffer 
we are undergoing significant strategic and organizational change 
failure to manage disruption to the business or the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business 
as part of our new strategic direction we are making significant changes to both management and organizational structure 
we recently announced a restructuring and our plan to divest of our dental business and our non core dermatology assets and related manufacturing facilities 
as a result of this  morale may be lowered and key employees may decide to leave  or may be distracted from their usual roles 
this could result in delays in development projects  failure to achieve targets or other disruption to the business 
research  development and regulatory risks we may not be successful in our efforts to expand our portfolio of products in targeted therapeutic segments 
an element of our strategy is to develop a portfolio of new drugs 
we are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and through licensing or otherwise acquiring the rights to potential new drugs and drug targets in targeted therapeutic segments 
a significant portion of the research that we are conducting involves new and unproven technologies 
research programs to identify new disease targets and product candidates require substantial technical  financial and human resources whether or not we ultimately identify any candidates 
our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates  yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons  including the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates  or potential product candidates may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate they are unlikely to be effective drugs 
we may be unable to license or acquire suitable product from third parties for a number of reasons 
in particular  the licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area 
a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products in the ophthalmic and other fields 
these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size  cash resources and greater clinical development and commercial capabilities 
other factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable product candidates include the following we may be unable to license or acquire the relevant technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return from the product  companies that perceive us to be their competitors may be unwilling to assign or license their product rights to us  or we may be unable to identify suitable products or product candidates within our targeted therapeutic segments 
if we are unable to develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs or by obtaining rights to novel therapeutics from third parties  our business will suffer 
our products in clinical trials may not achieve favorable results  may fail to achieve or maintain regulatory approvals or market acceptance  or may encounter difficulties with proprietary rights or manufacturing 
our success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval to market new pharmaceutical products 
development of a product requires substantial technical  financial and human resources even if such product development is not successfully completed 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is inherently uncertain 
our potential products may appear to be promising at various stages of clinical trials yet fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  including lack of sufficient treatment benefit or unacceptable safety issues during preclinical studies or clinical trials 
for example  we completed enrolment of a phase ii light dose ranging study of lemuteporfin in bph during the last quarter of in february we announced that the phase ii clinical trial of lemuteporfin injectable in patients with bph did not meet the study s primary efficacy objective at three months 
while the decrease in aua american urological association symptom score was consistent with that seen after other minimally invasive therapies  there was no significant difference between treatment and sham control groups 
we will continue to follow up patients that participated in that trial to determine whether there is any treatment benefit at the months time point after treatment  lack of commercial market opportunity  results from preclinical and early clinical studies not predictive of results obtained in large scale clinical trials  unfavorable data during a clinical trial causing us to determine that continuation of the trial is not warranted 
for example  in may  we halted our two phase iii studies of tariquidar in non small cell lung cancer after a review of safety and efficacy data by the independent data safety monitoring committee  the fda or other regulatory authorities suspending our clinical trials at any time if  among other reasons  it concludes that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  failure to receive or maintain necessary regulatory approvals after completion of clinical trials 
for example  our clinical study of visudyne in the occult form of wet amd  known as the vio study  failed to meet its primary endpoints 
while we do not currently expect that result to impact approvals received on the use of visudyne for the treatment of the occult form of wet amd in europe or elsewhere  if the governmental authorities were to revoke or limit such approvals previously granted  that could have a material adverse effect on the sales and revenue from visudyne  existence of conflicting proprietary rights of third parties  inability to develop manufacturing methods that are efficient  cost effective and capable of meeting stringent regulatory standards  and other business imperatives causing us to curtail a particular development program 
we might fail to obtain the additional regulatory approvals we are seeking to expand our product line and the indications for which our products are approved 
those approvals may be delayed  may not be obtained or may be more limited than anticipated 
we may lose market opportunities resulting from delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval process 
if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and  as a result  our business could be harmed 
from time to time  we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific  clinical  regulatory and other product development goals  which we sometimes refer to as milestones 
these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings 
from time to time  we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones 
all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions 
the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates  or they might not be achieved  in some cases for reasons beyond our control 
if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and  as a result  our business could be harmed 
factors which could cause us to fail to achieve milestones in accordance with our projections include study results may vary from what had been predicted  studies may take longer to enroll or conclude than projected  unfavorable data during a clinical trial might cause us to determine that continuation of the trial is not warranted  the fda or other regulatory authorities might suspend our clinical trials at any time if  for example  it concludes that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals after completion of clinical trials in a timely manner or at all  and other business imperatives might cause us to delay or discontinue certain development activities 
patient enrollment may not be adequate for our current trials or future clinical trials 
our future prospects could suffer if we fail to develop and maintain sufficient levels of patient enrollment in our current or future clinical trials 
our willingness and ability to complete clinical trials is dependent on  among other factors  the rate of patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the nature of our clinical trial protocols or products  the inability to secure regulatory approval to modify previously approved clinical trial protocols  the existence of competing protocols  the size and longevity of the target patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trials  and the patient dropout rates for the trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  delays or termination of clinical trials  which could materially harm our future prospects 
visudyne  eligard or our other products may exhibit adverse side effects that prevent their widespread adoption or that necessitate withdrawal from the market 
even after approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities  visudyne  eligard or our other products may later exhibit adverse side effects that prevent widespread use or necessitate withdrawal from the market 
undesirable side effects not previously observed during clinical trials could emerge in the future 
the manifestation of such side effects could cause our business to suffer 
in some cases  regulatory authorities may require labeling changes that could add warnings or restrict usage based on adverse side effects seen after marketing a drug 
we may be unable to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements 
our commercial products and our products under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by the us federal government  principally the fda  and by state and local governments 
to the extent visudyne  eligard  our other commercial products or products under development are marketed abroad  they are also subject to export requirements and to regulation by foreign governments 
the regulatory clearance process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not be able to obtain  or continue to obtain  necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis  or at all  for any of our commercial products or any of our products under development  and delays in receipt or failure to receive such clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could materially harm our business 
drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to the fda s approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda  certain state agencies and various foreign governmental regulatory agencies such as the emea 
manufacturers are subject to inspection by the fda and those state agencies  and they must comply with the host of regulatory requirements that usually apply to drugs marketed in the us  including but not limited to the fda s labeling regulations  good manufacturing practice requirements  adverse event reporting and the fda s general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved or off label uses 
our failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us 
these sanctions could include warning letters  fines  product recalls or seizures  injunctions  refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the us  fda refusal to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter into governmental supply contracts  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecutions 
we  our contract manufacturers  all of our subsuppliers  as well as the suppliers of the medical lasers required for visudyne and other pdt therapy  are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
in addition  advertising and promotional materials relating to medical devices and drugs are  in certain instances  subject to regulation by the federal trade commission or the fda 
we  our contract manufacturers  subsuppliers and laser suppliers may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future  and such laws or regulations may materially harm our business 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements  the failure of us  or any of these manufacturers  subsuppliers or suppliers to comply with such requirements or the adoption of new requirements could materially harm our business 
as noted above  all of our contract manufacturers must comply with the applicable fda cgmp regulations  which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
if our contract manufacturers do not comply with the applicable cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements  the availability of marketed products for sale could be reduced and we could suffer delays in the progress of clinical trials for products under development 
we do not have full control over our third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
the loss of a contract manufacturer could have a negative affect on our sales  margins and market share  as well as our overall business and financial results 
in the future  in the event we are involved directly in the marketing or promotion of our products  our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products are subject to regulation under the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal statutes 
violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 
we are also subject to various us federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive  or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions  it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti kickback or similar laws 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers including medicare and medicaid claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs including medicare and medicaid 
if a court were to find us liable for violating these laws  or if the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  including on our stock price 
we are subject to environmental compliance risks 
our research  development and manufacturing areas involve the controlled use of hazardous chemicals  primarily flammable solvents  corrosives  and toxins 
the biologic materials include microbiological cultures  animal tissue and serum samples 
some experimental and clinical materials include human source tissue or fluid samples 
we are subject to federal  state provincial and local government regulation in the conduct of business  including regulations on employee safety and handling and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials 
any new regulation or change to an existing regulation could require it to implement costly capital or operating improvements for which we have not budgeted 
if we do not comply with these regulations  we may be subject to fines and other liabilities 
risks relating to our financial results and condition our future operating results are uncertain and likely to fluctuate 
although we were profitable for the years  was impacted by a charge of million for purchase of in process research and development related to the atrix acquisition and was impacted by a million non cash charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that resulted from the atrix acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements  future operating performance and profitability are not certain 
our accumulated deficit at december  was approximately million 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons 
a revenue shortfall or increase in operating expenses could arise from any number of factors  such as lower than expected revenues from sales of visudyne  eligard or our other products 
for example  in connection with the ongoing patent litigation commenced by tap pharmaceuticals  inc  the sales of eligard in the us have been suspended from early march until may  by our marketing partner  sanofi synthelabo and the impact of that temporary suspension on sales of eligard our revenue from eligard during and in the future is unknown but may be material 
in addition  in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining from the court of appeals a permanent stay of the injunction order issued in connection with the tap patent litigation  qlt usa will be prevented from manufacturing and selling eligard to its licensees and distributors outside of the us until the expiry of the patent on may  see item legal proceedings  changes in pricing strategies or reimbursement levels for visudyne  eligard or our other products  seasonal fluctuations  particularly in the third quarter due to decreased demand for visudyne in the summer months  high levels of marketing expenses for visudyne or the launch of a competitor to visudyne  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unfavorable outcome of the patent litigation commenced by tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plaintiffs against qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo and the potential for an unfavorable outcome in the other patent related litigation against us  higher than expected operating expenses as a result of increased costs associated with the development or commercialization of visudyne  eligard and our other products and candidates  and increased operating expenses as a result of product  technology or other acquisitions or business combinations 
future sales of visudyne  eligard and our other products may be less than expected 
our prospects are dependent on the sales of our lead commercial product  visudyne  and to a lesser extent those of eligard and our other products 
our revenues to date have consisted largely of revenue from product sales of visudyne 
if sales of visudyne  beyond levels that we anticipate  fail to occur or sales of eligard and our other products fail to increase to the extent that we project  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our revenues from visudyne  eligard and our other products licensed to third parties could vary significantly in future periods  including  but not limited to  as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the initiation of new contractual arrangements with other companies  whether and when contract milestones are achieved  the failure of or refusal of a licensee to pay royalties  the expiration or invalidation of our patents or licensed intellectual property 
for example  patent litigations  interferences  oppositions  and other proceedings involving our patents often include claims by third parties that such patents are invalid or unenforceable 
if a court  patent office  or other authority were to determine that a patent under which we receive royalties and or other revenues is invalid or unenforceable  that determination could cause us to suffer a loss of such royalties and or revenues  and could cause us to incur other monetary damages  and decreases in licensees sales of product due to competition  manufacturing difficulties  adverse outcomes in ongoing litigation or other factors that affect the sales of product 
a number of factors may affect the rate and breadth of market acceptance and continued use of our commercial products  including perceptions of physicians and patients regarding the safety and efficacy of our products  patient and physician demand  the results of product development efforts for new indications or additional market opportunities for visudyne  eligard  and our other products  availability of sufficient commercial quantities of visudyne  eligard and our other products  price changes for our products  and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments  retreatment rates for visudyne throughout the treatment process varying from the retreatment rates during clinical development  the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for visudyne  eligard  and our other products  adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning visudyne  eligard or our other products  a decline in the market for visudyne  or incidence rates of wet amd  such as might occur if preventative treatments currently in development are successful  a decline in the markets for eligard or our other products  or a decline in reimbursement levels for our products  as well as the other factors that are described in this section 
our effective income tax rate may vary significantly and may adversely affect our results of operations and cash resources 
significant judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate 
these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  results of audits by tax authorities  future levels of r d spending  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes 
we may need additional capital in the future  and our prospects for obtaining it are uncertain 
our business may not generate the cash necessary to fund our operations and anticipated growth 
the amount required to fund additional operating expenses will also depend on other factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the extent and success of any collaborative research arrangements  any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with any ongoing litigation as a result of an adverse court decision or any settlement agreement that we may enter into  and the results of product  technology or other acquisitions or business combinations 
we could seek additional funds in the future from a combination of sources  including product licensing  joint development and other financing arrangements 
in addition  we may issue debt or equity securities if we determine that additional cash resources could be obtained under favorable conditions or if future development funding requirements cannot be satisfied with available cash resources 
additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate capital is unavailable  we may not be able to engage in desirable acquisition or in licensing opportunities and may have to reduce substantially or eliminate expenditures for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing for visudyne  eligard and our other products 
we have convertible debt outstanding  which  if not converted into equity  will require a significant amount of cash and may adversely affect our financial position and cash resources 
as of december   we had approximately million of convertible debt bearing interest at the rate of per annum and due in on each of september   and  holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  that date 
on the occurrence of certain events  such as a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
the notes also become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default by us 
in the event that the holders of the convertible debt elect to require repayment of the debt instead of conversion to our common shares  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including our convertible debt obligation  and to fund planned capital expenditures  r d  as well as stock repurchases and expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are and will remain beyond our control 
additionally  our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  r d  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  and limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
we may be unsuccessful in divesting our non core dermatology business and related manufacturing facilities 
we have previously announced our intention to divest our non core dermatology business and related manufacturing business in order to focus our business and resources on the development of proprietary pharmaceutical products 
we may be unable to locate a purchaser for those assets  either at all or on terms that we consider to be satisfactory 
in addition  under the collaboration agreement between qlt usa and sandoz  inc with respect to the development  manufacture and commercialization of our generic dermatology products  sandoz has the right to consent to any assignee of our interests in such agreement  although sandoz may not unreasonably withhold its consent 
in the event that we are unable to divest all or part of the non core dermatology business and manufacturing facilities  the continued operation of that part of our business may distract management attention and utilize resources that impact our ability to focus and advance our business on proprietary pharmaceutical products 
the market price of our common shares is extremely volatile 
the stock prices of biopharmaceutical companies  including qlt  are extremely volatile  and it is likely that the market price of our common shares will continue to be highly volatile 
during  the daily closing market price of our common shares on nasdaq ranged from a high of in january to a low of in december 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including announcements by us or our competitors of product sales  significant acquisitions  strategic relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new commercial products  results of clinical trials for our products under development  developments relating to patents  proprietary rights and potential infringement  developments or outcome of litigation  including litigation regarding proprietary and patent rights  expense and time associated with obtaining government approvals for marketing of visudyne  eligard and our other products under development  reimbursement policies of various government and third party payers that may impact the pricing or reimbursement of our products or the products of our competitors  public concern over the safety of visudyne  eligard and our other products under development or those of our competitors  changes in estimates of our revenue and operating results  variances in our revenue  operating results or cash position from forecasts or projections  recommendations of securities analysts regarding investment in our stock  governmental reimbursement discussions  adverse developments in the pending patent litigation to which we are a party  and factors beyond our control which affect the stock markets generally and which might materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance  including  but not limited to  current political and economic events  market and industry trends and broad market fluctuations 
various provisions of our charter and our shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding a change in control  making removal of the present management more difficult or resulting in restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to the shareholders 
with shareholder approval  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be in effect until our annual general meeting in the general effect of the plan is to require anyone who seeks to acquire or more of our outstanding common shares to make a bid complying with specific provisions included in the plan 
in certain circumstances  holders of common shares may acquire additional shares of qlt or those of the acquirer at a discount from the then prevailing market price 
the provisions of the plan could prevent or delay the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise  making it more difficult for shareholders to receive any premium over the current market price that might be offered 
our authorized preference share capital is available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors  without shareholder approval 
our charter grants the board of directors the authority  subject to the corporate laws of british columbia  to determine or alter the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed on any wholly unissued series of preference shares  including any dividend rate  voting rights  conversion privileges or redemption or liquidation rights 
the rights of any future series of preference shares could have an adverse effect on the holders of our common shares by delaying or preventing a change of control  making removal of the present management more difficult or resulting in restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to the holders of common shares

item legal proceedings certain of our legal proceedings are discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements  contingencies 
while we believe the claims against us are without merit  it is impossible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these proceedings 
a tap litigation united states in  plaintiffs tap pharmaceutical products  inc  takeda chemical industries ltd 
and wako pure chemical industries  ltd 
filed suit against our subsidiary  qlt usa and co defendant sanofi synthelabo  inc in the us federal court in the northern district of illinois eastern division case no 
cv 
tap and its co plaintiffs allege that qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo willfully infringe us patent no 
 the patent by the manufacture and sale in the united states of the eligard product line and seek injunctive relief  damages  and an award of attorneys fees and costs against qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo 
in its amended answer to the claim  qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo denied the material allegations of the complaint and asserted that the patent is invalid  unenforceable  and not infringed 
qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo also asserted a counterclaim for declaratory judgments of invalidity  unenforceability  and non infringement 
in december  the case went to trial on liability issues 
in the trial  qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo did not contest infringement of the asserted claims of the patent in suit as they were construed by the district judge 
a jury rendered verdicts that qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo had not proved  by clear and convincing evidence  that the asserted claims were invalid 
thereafter  the judge issued findings of fact rejecting defendants unenforceability defense 
on january   the district court entered judgment for tap and its co plaintiffs on the invalidity and unenforceability defenses 
in february  plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court seeking an injunction 
on february  the district court granted an injunction  subject to a seven day stay  enjoining us  sanofi aventis and their subsidiaries from promoting  manufacturing  selling and offering for sale eligard products in the united states until may  the court further ordered qlt and sanofi aventis to recall any eligard products that they still own and provide a voluntary recall program to allow physicians  wholesalers and distributors  who wish to do so  to return eligard products for a full refund 
on february   qlt usa filed a notice of appeal in the district court  as well an emergency motion in the court of appeals for the federal circuit seeking a stay of the injunction pending the outcome of the appeal 
thereafter  the court of appeals issued an order staying the injunction issued by the district court on a temporary basis while the court of appeals considers qlt usa s motion 
sanofi synthelabo has also filed a motion with the court of appeals seeking a stay of the injunction 
the court of appeals has not yet issued a decision whether or not to grant a permanent stay of the injunction 
although the injunction has been stayed pending the decision of the court of appeals  sanofi synthelabo advised that it has voluntarily discontinued the marketing and sale of eligard in the united states until may  earlier in the case  the trial on damages and willfulness was separated from the trial on liability 
following the trial decision on liability  the district court issued a scheduling order for the damages and willfulness phase of the case 
the court said that a trial date will be set following a status conference to be held in june under the marketing agreement entered into between qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo  qlt usa has provided certain indemnities to sanofi synthelabo and its affiliates  including indemnities covering certain losses relating to product liability and infringement of a third party s proprietary rights 
while we cannot estimate the potential damages in the tap litigation  or what level of indemnification  if any  will be required under the marketing agreement with sanofi synthelabo  the amount could be substantial  which could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of qlt usa and consequently  on qlt inc  and  qlt usa may be permanently enjoined from manufacturing and selling some or all of its eligard products in the us and to our licensees and distributors outside of the us until the patent expires on may  germany on june   our eligard marketing collaborator  medigene ag  filed an action in the federal patent court  munich  germany  seeking a nullification of the european equivalent to the patent  european patent the patent 
on june   takeda chemical industries ltd  wako pure chemical industries  ltd 
and takeda pharma gmbh sought a provisional injunction in the regional court hamburg  germany  on the basis that the marketing of eligard by medigene and yamanouchi now astellas in germany violated the patent 
the court denied that request 
on june   the takeda companies and wako filed a complaint in the regional court d sseldorf  germany  against medigene and yamanouchi  alleging infringement of the patent 
in april  in the suit initiated by medigene  the federal patent court ruled that all of the claims asserted by the takeda companies and wako in their subsequent infringement suit are null and void in germany on the grounds of lack of novelty 
takeda and wako have appealed that decision 
the regional court d sseldorf has stayed the infringement action brought by takeda and wako in view of the federal patent court s decision 
the final outcomes of both disputes are not presently determinable or estimable and there can be no assurance that the matters will be finally resolved in our favor 
if the lawsuits are not resolved in our favor  we might be obliged to pay damages  or an additional royalty or damages for access to the inventions covered by claims in issued us patents  and might be subject to such equitable relief as a court may determine which could include an injunction or a remedy combining some or all of those remedies foregoing 
b patent litigation with meei the first meei lawsuit in april  massachusetts eye and ear infirmary meei filed a civil suit against qlt inc in the united states district court the court for the district of massachusetts seeking to establish exclusive rights for meei as the owner of certain inventions relating to the use of verteporfin as the photoactive agent in the treatment of certain eye diseases including amd 
in  we moved for summary judgement against meei on all eight counts of meei s complaint in civil action no 
jlt 
the court granted all of our summary motions  dismissing all of meei s claims 
with respect to our counterclaim requesting correction of inventorship of the patent to add an additional mgh inventor  the court stayed the claim pending the outcome of the lawsuit described below 
meei appealed the decision of the court to the us district court of appeals 
on february  the court of appeals issued its ruling  upholding the dismissal of five of meei s eight claims  and remanding three claims to trial on the basis that they should not have been determined on summary judgment 
on march   we petitioned the court of appeals for a panel rehearing and a rehearing en banc by the full court 
on april   the court issued an order allowing our petition for panel rehearing in part and denying it in part 
our petition for rehearing en banc was denied without prejudice to refiling after the panel s decision on the rehearing 
the original three judge panel reconsidered  but ultimately did not change its decision to remand three of meei s claims unjust enrichment  unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets for trial before the district court 
in july we re filed our petition for rehearing en banc  which was subsequently denied 
in february  we filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court asserting that meei s claim for unjust enrichment is preempted by federal patent law 
the court of appeals has stayed the remand to the court pending the resolution of our petition by the supreme court 
the second meei lawsuit in may the united states patent office issued united states patent no 
 the patent to meei 
the patent is derived from the same patent family as the patent in issue in the first suit  the patent  and claims a method of treating unwanted choroidal neovasculature in a shortened treatment time using verteporfin 
the patent application which led to the issuance of the patent was filed and prosecuted by attorneys for meei and  in contrast to the patent  named only meei researchers as inventors 
the same day the patent was issued  meei commenced a second civil suit against us and novartis ophthalmics  inc now novartis ophthalmics  a division of novartis pharma ag in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of the patent civil action no 
efh 
the suit seeks damages and injunctive relief for patent infringement and unjust enrichment 
we have answered the complaint  denying its material allegations and raising a number of affirmative defenses  and have asserted counterclaims against meei and the two meei researchers who are named as inventors on the patent 
in april  we moved to dismiss meei s claim for unjust enrichment on the grounds that this claim had been previously decided by a court 
the court granted our motion in may of in january  the court ordered in our favour in one of our counterclaims and declared that the inventorship of the patent be corrected to add qlt as joint inventors 
that ruling gives us the right  as co owner  to exploit the patent in issue 
meei has appealed this decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the final outcomes of both of the above lawsuits are not presently determinable or estimable and there can be no assurance that the matters will be finally resolved in our favor 
if the lawsuits are not resolved in our favor  we might be obliged to pay damages  or an additional royalty or damages for access to the inventions covered by claims in issued us patents  and might be subject to such equitable relief as a court may determine which could include an injunction or a remedy combining some or all of those remedies foregoing

certain canadian and us federal income tax information for us residents the following is a summary of certain canadian and us federal income tax considerations applicable to holders of common shares of our company 
these tax considerations are stated in brief and general terms and are based on canadian and us law currently in effect 
there are other potentially significant canadian and us federal income tax considerations and provincial  state and local income tax considerations with respect to ownership and disposition of the common shares which are not discussed herein 
the tax considerations relative to ownership and disposition of the common shares may vary from shareholder to shareholder depending on the shareholder s particular status 
accordingly  shareholders and prospective shareholders are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding tax considerations  which may apply to the particular situation 
canadian federal tax information dividends paid on the common shares held by non residents of canada will generally be subject to canadian withholding tax at the rate of 
the canada us income tax convention the convention provides that the withholding rate on dividends paid to us residents on the common shares is generally 
gains on sales or other dispositions of the common shares of our company by a us resident generally are not subject to canadian income tax  unless the shareholder realizes the gains in connection with a business carried on in canada 
a gain realized upon the disposition of the common shares by a us resident that is otherwise subject to canadian tax may be exempt from canadian tax under the convention 
where the common shares are disposed of by way of an acquisition of such common shares by our company  other than a purchase in the open market in the manner in which common shares normally would be purchased by any member of the public in the open market  the amount paid by our company in excess of the paid up capital of such common shares will be treated as a dividend and will be subject to non resident withholding tax as described above 
us federal tax information distributions with respect to our common shares generally will be taxable as dividends to the extent of our company s earnings and profits  determined under us tax principles  subject to the same preferential rate that applies to long term capital gain currently  
under current law  for taxable years beginning after december   distributions will be taxed at ordinary rates without the benefit of such preferential rates 
corporate us holders generally will not be allowed a deduction for dividends received in respect of distributions on our common shares 
dividends will be treated as income from sources outside the us  but generally will be passive income  or in the case of a financial services entity  financial services income and  for taxable years beginning after december   as general category income for us foreign tax credit purposes 
special rules apply to us holders that hold stock in a passive foreign investment company pfic 
a foreign corporation generally will be a pfic for any taxable year in which either i or more of its gross income is passive income or ii or more of the average value of its assets consist of assets that produce  or that are held for the production of  passive income 
for this purpose  passive income generally includes  among other things  interest  dividends  rents  royalties and gains from certain commodities transactions 
we believe that our company was not a pfic in and anticipate that it will not be a pfic with respect to any subsequent taxable year 
however  there can be no assurance that our company will not be considered a pfic in a future taxable year  because status under the pfic rules is based in part on factors not entirely within the company s control such as market capitalization 
we believe that our company was a pfic in one or more taxable years prior to accordingly  a us holder whose common shares were held at any time during a taxable year in which our company was a pfic may be subject to increased tax liability upon the sale  exchange or other disposition of shares of our common shares or upon the receipt of certain distributions 
these adverse tax consequences will not apply  however  if a us holder timely filed and maintained and in certain cases  continue to maintain a qualified electing fund qef election to be taxed annually on the holder s pro rata portion of our company s earnings and profits 
we intend to comply with all record keeping  reporting and other requirements so that us holders  who must continue to maintain a qef election to avoid increased tax liability with respect to our common shares  may do so 
however  if meeting those record keeping and reporting requirements becomes onerous  we may decide  in our sole discretion  that such compliance is impractical and will so notify us holders 
until such time  us holders that desire to maintain a qef election may contact our investment relations group for the pfic annual information statement  which may be used to complete their annual qef election filings

overview we are a global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies 
our research and development efforts are focused on the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products in the fields of ophthalmology and dermatology 
in addition  we utilize our proprietary platform drug delivery system  atrigel  to develop new pharmaceutical products 
our company was formed in under the laws of the province of british columbia  canada 
in november  we acquired atrix laboratories  inc  a fort collins  colorado based biopharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery 
with our acquisition of atrix now our wholly owned subsidiary  qlt usa we have expanded and diversified our portfolio of approved products  products in development or under regulatory review  and proprietary technologies 
for product revenues  see our consolidated financial statements note 
our first commercial product was in the field of photodynamic therapy  or pdt  which uses photosensitizers light activated drugs in the treatment of disease 
our lead commercial product  visudyne  utilizes pdt to treat the eye disease known as wet age related macular degeneration  or wet amd  the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of in north america and europe 
visudyne is commercially available in more than countries  including the us  canada  japan and the european union countries  for the treatment of a form of wet amd known as predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization  or cnv  and in over countries for the form of wet amd known as occult subfoveal cnv 
visudyne is reimbursed in the us by the centers for medicare medicaid services for certain patients with the occult and minimally classic forms of wet amd 
it is also approved in more than countries  including the us  canada and the european union countries  for the treatment of subfoveal cnv due to pathologic myopia severe near sightedness 
in some countries  including the us and canada  visudyne is also approved for presumed ocular histoplasmosis or other macular diseases 
qlt develops and commercializes visudyne through a co development  manufacturing and commercialization agreement with novartis ophthalmics of switzerland a division of novartis pharma ag 
in addition to our lead commercial product visudyne  we now market through commercial partners the eligard line of products for the treatment of prostate cancer  and a line of dermatology products 
the eligard product line includes four different commercial formulations of our atrigel technology combined with leuprolide acetate for the treatment of prostate cancer 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  has approved all four products eligard mg one month  eligard mg three month  eligard mg four month and eligard mg six month 
the eligard mg and eligard mg products are also approved in a number of other countries  including most european countries  canada  australia  new zealand and a number of latin american countries 
in addition to the us  eligard mg four month and eligard mg six month are also approved in canada  australia and new zealand 
however  in connection with the ongoing patent litigation commenced by tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plaintiffs in the united states and canada  the marketing partner for eligard in the united states  sanofi sythelabo  inc or sanofi synthelabo  has suspended the sales of eligard in the united states from early march to may  see item legal proceedings 
our efforts to increase our portfolio of products are ongoing 
we also have a number of product candidates that utilize the atrigel drug delivery system in our pipeline 
we carry out research and pre clinical projects in our core therapeutic area of ophthalmology  and other areas such as dermatology 
we also conduct contract research and development work on product candidates of third parties using the atrigel drug delivery system in a number of therapeutic areas from which we can potentially derive royalty revenue upon commercialization 
our portfolio of dermatology products consists of both proprietary and generic products that are commercialized  under regulatory review  or in various stages of development 
our most advanced proprietary dermatology product  aczone  was approved by the fda in july although aczone is approved in the u 
s  it is not yet marketed 
a decision with respect to the commercialization of aczone is pending the outcome of an additional phase iv clinical study and submission to the fda to remove a restriction currently on the approved label for the product see item business our approved products aczone 
our generic dermatology business  which is part of a development and commercialization arrangement with sandoz  inc  currently comprises seven approved products  six of which are currently marketed  two additional ones that are tentatively approved final approval pending patent expiration of the original compounds and four products under regulatory review 
to further focus our business on the research and development of proprietary products in our core therapeutic areas  we have previously announced that we are planning to divest our non core dermatology assets  including the generic dermatology business and our manufacturing facilities associated with the dermatology business 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates are used for  but not limited to  provisions for non completion of inventory  assessment of the recoverability and impairment of long lived and intangible assets  assessment of impairment of goodwill  accruals for contract manufacturing and research and development agreements  allocation of costs to manufacturing under a standard costing system  allocation of overhead expenses to research and development  determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the purchase business combinations  and provisions for taxes and contingencies 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those which follow reporting currency and foreign currency translation we use the us dollar as our reporting currency  while the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the parent company  qlt inc  and the us dollar is the functional currency for the us subsidiary  qlt usa 
our consolidated financial statements are translated into us dollars using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date 
shareholders equity is translated at the applicable historical rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at a weighted average rate of exchange for the respective years 
translation gains and losses from the application of the us dollar as the reporting currency are included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment  which is reported as a component of shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   our accumulated other comprehensive income totalled million 
revenue recognition net product revenue our net product revenues are primarily derived from sales of visudyne and eligard 
with respect to visudyne  under the terms of our collaborative agreement with novartis ophthalmics we are responsible for visudyne manufacturing and product supply  and novartis ophthalmics is responsible for marketing and distribution of visudyne 
our agreement with novartis ophthalmics provides that the calculation of total revenue for the sale of visudyne be composed of three components an advance on the cost of inventory sold to novartis ophthalmics  an amount equal to of the profit that novartis ophthalmics derives from the sale of visudyne to end customers  and the reimbursement of other specified costs incurred and paid for by us 
we recognize revenue from the sale of visudyne when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to novartis ophthalmics has occurred  the end selling price of visudyne is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under the calculation of revenue noted above  this occurs upon sell through of visudyne to the end customers 
our revenue from visudyne will fluctuate dependent upon novartis ophthalmics ability to market and distribute visudyne to end customers 
with respect to eligard  under the terms of our collaborative agreements with our marketing partners  we are responsible for the manufacture of eligard and receive from our marketing partners an agreed upon sales price upon shipment to them 
we also earn royalties from certain marketing partners based upon their sales of eligard products to end customers  which are included in net royalty revenue 
we recognize net revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product is shipped and title is transferred to our marketing partners  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed or determinable 
our net product revenue from eligard will fluctuate dependent upon our ability to deliver eligard products to our marketing partners 
our eligard marketing partners are responsible for all products after shipment from our facility 
under this calculation of revenue  we recognize net product revenue from eligard at the time of shipment to our marketing partners 
we do not offer rebates or discounts in the normal course of business and have not experienced any material product returns  accordingly  we did not provide an allowance for rebates  discounts  and returns 
net royalties we recognize net royalties when product is shipped by certain of our marketing partners to end customers based on royalty rates and profit formulas specified in our agreements with them 
generally  royalties are based on estimated net product sales gross sales less discounts  allowances and other items and calculated based on information supplied to us by our marketing partners 
contract research and development contract research and development revenues consist of non refundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with our various strategic partners 
contract research and development funding generally compensates us for discovery  preclinical and clinical expenses related to collaborative development programs for certain products and product candidates  and is recognized as revenue at the time research and development activities are performed under the terms of the collaborative agreements 
for fixed price contracts we recognize contract research and development revenue over the term of the agreement consistent with the pattern of work performed 
amounts received under the collaborative agreements for work actually performed are non refundable even if the research and development efforts performed by us do not eventually result in a commercial product 
contract research and development revenues earned in excess of payments received are classified as contract research and development receivables and payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
licensing and milestones we have licensing agreements that generally provide for non refundable license fees and or milestone payments 
the licensing agreements typically require a non refundable license fee and allow our partners to sell our proprietary products in a defined territory for a defined period 
a milestone payment is a payment made by a partner to us upon achievement of a pre determined event  as defined in the applicable agreement 
non refundable license fees and milestone payments are initially reported as deferred revenue 
they are recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual term or as covered by patent protection  whichever is earlier  using the straight line method or until the agreement is terminated 
no milestone revenue is recognized until we have completed the required milestone related services as set forth in licensing agreements 
cost of sales visudyne cost of sales  consisting of expenses related to the production of bulk visudyne and royalty expense on visudyne sales  are charged against earnings in the period that novartis ophthalmics sells to end customers 
cost of sales related to the production of various eligard  generic dermatology  and dental products are charged against earnings in the period of the related product sale to our marketing partners 
we utilize a standard costing system  which includes a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses  to account for inventory and cost of sales  with adjustments being made periodically to reflect current conditions 
our standard costs are estimated based on management s best estimate of annual production volumes and material costs 
overhead expenses comprise direct and indirect support activities related to the manufacture of bulk visudyne  various eligard  generic dermatology  and dental products and involve costs associated with activities such as quality inspection  quality assurance  supply chain management  safety and regulatory 
overhead expenses are allocated to inventory at various stages of the manufacturing process under a standard costing system  and eventually to cost of sales as the related products are sold to our marketing partners or in the case of visudyne  by novartis ophthalmics to third parties 
while we believe our standard costs are reliable  actual production costs and volume changes may impact inventory  cost of sales  and the absorption of production overheads 
we record a provision for the non completion of product inventory based on our history of batch completion to provide for the potential failure of inventory batches to pass quality inspection 
the provision is calculated at each stage of the manufacturing process 
we estimate our non completion rate based on past production and adjust our provision based on actual production volume 
a batch failure may utilize a significant portion of the provision as a single completed batch currently costs up to million  depending on the product and the stage of production 
we provide a reserve for obsolescence of our eligard inventory and component materials based on our periodic evaluation of potential obsolete inventory and our history of inventory obsolescence 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have provided the pro forma disclosures of net income and net income per share in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  using the fair value method in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
the statement eliminates the alternative to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock award 
we adopted this statement on january  using a modified prospective application as defined in sfas r 
as such  the compensation expense recognition provisions are applicable to new awards and to any awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  for any unvested awards outstanding at the adoption date  we recognize compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
estimates of fair value are determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of this model requires certain assumptions regarding the volatility  term  and risk free interest rate experienced by the holder 
although we believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations  the full impact of this adoption on our consolidated financial statements cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact on our net income per common share would have been as described in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
we are unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options and our ability to utilize the tax benefits 
research and development research and development costs consist of direct and indirect expenditures  including a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses  associated with our various research and development programs 
overhead expenses comprise general and administrative support provided to the research and development programs and involve costs associated with support activities such as facility maintenance  utilities  office services  information technology  legal  accounting and human resources 
the allocation of overhead expenses requires us to make estimates as to the type and level of support required by our research and development programs 
changes in the composition of our workforce and the types of support activities are factors that can influence our allocation of overhead expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
costs related to the acquisition of development rights for which no alternative use exists are classified as research and development and expensed as incurred 
patent application  filing and defense costs are also expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are reported using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to i differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and ii operating loss and tax credit carry forwards using applicable enacted tax rates 
an increase or decrease in these tax rates will increase or decrease the carrying value of future net tax assets resulting in an increase or decrease to net income 
income tax credits are included as part of the provision for income taxes 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  future levels of research and development spending  and changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any loss carry forward balance 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset may not be realized 
see note income taxes in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
legal proceedings we are involved in a number of legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in these legal actions  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in the consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
our potentially material legal proceedings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   no reserve has been established related to these proceedings 
long lived and intangible assets we incur costs to purchase and occasionally construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
costs incurred in the initial design and evaluation phase  such as the cost of performing feasibility studies and evaluating alternatives are charged to expense 
costs incurred in the committed project planning and design phase  and in the construction and installation phase  are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset 
we stop capitalizing costs when an asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
since  we have been depreciating plant and equipment using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for potential impairment under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform these evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
if impairment recognition criteria in sfas have been met  we charge impairments of the long lived assets to operations 
as a result of circumstances discussed in comparison of years ended december  and  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the pilot manufacturing facility 
in accounting for acquisitions  we allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
we generally estimate the value of acquired intangible assets and ipr d using a discounted cash flow model  which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about  among other things the time and investment that is required to develop products and technologies  our ability to develop and commercialize products before our competitors develop and commercialize products for the same indications  the amount of revenue to be derived from the products  and appropriate discount rates to use in the analysis 
use of different estimates and judgments could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in materially different asset values and ipr d charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge to intangible assets of million as events and circumstances indicated impairment of our acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of atrix laboratories  inc  or atrix  in see discussion under comparison of years ended december  and as of december   after the impairment charge to intangible assets  there was million of net acquired intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet  all of which relates to the acquisition of atrix 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives of years 
determining the economic lives of acquired intangible assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangibles  we are required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates were made at the time of acquisition of atrix specifically regarding product development  market conditions and cash flows that were used to determine the valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
during the quarter ended december   we performed an impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment of million related to our acquisition of atrix in  as the fair value of our reporting unit did not exceed its carrying amount 
our estimates of fair value are based upon factors such as projected future revenue  probability of success of our products in development  and other uncertain elements requiring significant judgments 
while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  actual results in the future could differ significantly 
impairment tests may be required in future periods before our next annual test as a result of changes in forecasts and estimates  and may result in impairment charges which could materially impact our future reported results 
see discussion under comparison of years ended december  and recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
the statement eliminates the alternative to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide service in exchange for the stock award 
we adopted this statement on january  using a modified prospective application as defined in sfas r see discussion under stock based compensation above 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion and fasb statement sfas 
this statement replaces apb opinion  accounting changes and fasb statement  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in an accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statement and sfas 
this statement simplifies accounting for certain hybrid financial statements by permitting fair value remeasurements for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  and eliminates the restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity spe may hold 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangibles  we are required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we look for the existence of facts and circumstances  either internal or external  which indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recovered

outlook for the statements and information contained in this section are forward looking 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements 
based on recent events and current trends in visudyne sales  we are projecting a decline in visudyne sales in as visudyne faces significant competitive pressure 
in the ongoing patent litigation brought by tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plaintiffs against qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo  inc in the united states  on february   an injunction was ordered by the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division which prohibits the manufacture  use  sale  offering for sale and promotion of eligard in the us until the expiry of the tap patent that is the subject of that litigation on may  the court of appeals has granted qlt usa a stay of that injunction pending the court of appeals decision whether to grant a permanent stay 
however  the marketing partner for eligard in the us  sanofi synthelabo  has suspended the promotion  marketing and sale of eligard in the us from early march until may  and initiated a voluntary withdrawal of eligard in the us if the court of appeal does not grant a permanent stay of the injunction  qlt usa will then be enjoined from the further manufacture and sale of eligard to its licensees and distributors worldwide until may  which may adversely affect the sales of eligard outside of the us we cannot predict at this time the impact of those events on or future sales of eligard 
we also expect significantly increased legal expenses in from those incurred in prior years in connection with the tap litigation 
a number of other factors can also impact sales of our products 
see item legal proceedings and in item business risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations  product development and capital expenditures primarily through proceeds from our commercial operations  public and private sales of equity securities  private placement of convertible senior notes  licensing and collaborative funding arrangements with strategic partners  and interest income 
the primary drivers of our operating cash flows during were cash receipts from product revenues  and royalties  and cash payments related to the following r d activities  sg a expenses  legal expenses related to various legal proceedings  raw materials purchases  contract manufacturing fees for the manufacture of visudyne  manufacturing costs related to the production of eligard  interest expense related to our convertible notes  income tax instalments and the share buyback program 
for the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operations as opposed to million for the same period in higher cash receipts from visudyne sales and contract research and development million as opposed to million in the same period in  cash receipts from qlt usa product sales  royalties  contract research and development and licensing and milestone payments million as opposed to in the same period in  and higher foreign exchange contract gains of million as compared to the same period in  lower income tax instalments million as opposed to million and higher interest income of million  were offset by increased operating and inventory related expenditures of million and a million milestone received from axcan pharma inc in for which no similar amount was received in we began paying cash income tax instalments in canada in the third quarter of when we started incurring liability for cash taxes having utilized most of our tax losses and other tax assets 
previously  our deferred tax assets tax losses and other deductions from prior periods were sufficient to eliminate cash taxes 
we are currently cash taxable in canada 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures  an increase in short term investments  and remaining acquisition costs related to the atrix acquisition in accounted for the most significant cash flows used in investing activities 
we used million on acquisition costs related to atrix and million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to our pilot manufacturing facility in vancouver 
for the year ended december  our cash flows used in financing activities consisted primarily of shares repurchased for million offset by cash receipts of million from stock option exercises 
interest and foreign exchange rates we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our current assets and liabilities 
at december   we had an investment portfolio consisting of fixed interest rate securities with an average remaining maturity of approximately days 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by of levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments approximately million denominated in us dollars and million of us dollar denominated debt 
of the million us dollar denominated balance  million was held by our canadian parent company  approximately offsetting our us dollar denominated debt 
if the us dollar were to decrease in value by against the canadian dollar  the decline in fair value of our us dollar denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would be mostly offset by the decline in the fair value of our million us dollar denominated long term debt  resulting in an immaterial amount of unrealized foreign currency translation loss 
as the functional currency of the us subsidiary is the us dollar  the us dollar denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments holdings of our us subsidiary do not result in foreign currency gains and losses in operations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage exposures to currency rate fluctuations related to our expected future net income and cash flows 
the net unrealized gain in respect of such foreign currency contracts  as at december   was approximately million and was included as part of the net foreign exchange gains in our results of operations 
we purchase goods and services primarily in canadian and us dollars and earn a significant portion of our revenues in us dollars 
foreign exchange risk is also managed by satisfying us dollar denominated expenditures with us dollar cash flows or assets 
at december   we have outstanding forward foreign currency contracts as noted below 
maturity period quantity millions average price us canadian dollar option dated forward contracts to sell usd usd per usd swiss franc canadian dollar option dated forward contract to sell chf chf per chf contractual obligations during august of  we completed a rule a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually beginning march  the convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders into common shares at the conversion rates referred to below only in the following circumstances i if our common share price  calculated over a specified period  has exceeded of the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes  ii if the trading price of the convertible senior notes over a specified period has fallen below of the amount equal to our then prevailing common share price times the applicable conversion rate provided that no notes may be converted pursuant to this condition after september   if  on any trading day during the specified period  the closing sale price of our common shares is greater than the conversion price in effect during such trading day and less than or equal to of such conversion price  iii if the convertible senior notes are called for redemption  or iv if specified corporate transactions were to occur 
the notes are convertible into our common shares  at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents a conversion price of approximately per share 
on or after september   we may at our option redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
we also have the option to redeem for cash all  but not less than all  of the notes at of their principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date  in the event of certain changes to canadian withholding tax requirements 
on each of september   and  holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  that date 
on the occurrence of certain events  such as a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued unpaid interest to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
the notes also become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default by us 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the notes are effectively subordinated to all of our future secured indebtedness and all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries  including trade payables 
in the normal course of business  we enter into product supply agreements with contract manufacturers which expire at various dates through as well as other purchase commitments related to daily operations 
in addition  we have entered into operating lease agreements related to office equipment and office space 
the minimum annual commitments related to these agreements and our long term debt are as follows in thousands of us dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt principal interest operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt relates to the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes described above 
the amounts in the table above include interest and principal payable to assuming holders of the notes redeem on the earliest permitted redemption date of september  if redemption does not occur until the due date in  total interest payable will be million 
operating leases comprise our long term leases of photocopiers  office space and postage meters 
purchase obligations comprise minimum purchase requirements of our product supply agreements with contract manufacturers million and other outstanding purchase commitments related to the normal course of business million 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of our business  we regularly provide indemnities with respect to certain matters  including product liability  patent infringement  contractual breaches and misrepresentations  and other indemnities to third parties under the clinical trial  license  service  manufacturing  supply  distribution and other agreements that we enter into in the normal course of our business 
in addition  under the agreement entered into between qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo  inc with respect to the marketing and sale of eligard in the us and canada  qlt usa has provided to sanofi synthelabo and its affiliates certain indemnities with respect to the matters including intellectual property infringement claims that may arise in connection with the litigation commenced by tap pharmaceuticals  inc and its co plaintiffs against qlt usa and sanofi synthelabo  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
except as described above and the contractual arrangements described in the contractual obligations section  we do not have any other arrangements that create risk for qlt and are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
general we believe that our available cash resources and working capital  and our cash generating capabilities  should be more than sufficient to satisfy the funding of ongoing product development programs and other operating and capital requirements  including the in licensing or acquisition of products and technologies for the reasonably foreseeable future 
the nature and form of any future in licensing or acquisition may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
depending on the overall structure of current and future strategic alliances  we may have additional capital requirements related to the further development  marketing and distribution of existing or future products 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the status of competitors  the outcome of legal proceedings see item legal proceedings and item business risk factors  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and r d programs  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  marketing and support capabilities  technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
we may require additional capital in the future to fund any damage awards resulting from legal proceedings against us  clinical and product development costs for certain product applications or other technology opportunities  and strategic acquisitions of products  product candidates  technologies or other businesses 
accordingly  we may seek funding from a combination of sources  including product licensing  joint development and new collaborative arrangements  additional equity or debt financing or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional funding will be available or  if available  on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate capital is not available  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
to focus our business on the research and development of proprietary products in our core therapeutic areas  we received approval early to proceed with divesting of our non core dermatology assets  including the generic dermatology business and our manufacturing facility in fort collins  colorado  that is associated with the dermatology business 
furthermore  we do not consider the ongoing revenue from the sales of our dental products to be material to our business and are planning to divest our interest in the dental business and technology 
the carrying values of the assets included as part of this divestiture as of december   are property  plant and equipment of million  product inventory of million  and intangible assets of million
