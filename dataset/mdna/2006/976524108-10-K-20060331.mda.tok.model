the financial information presented herein includes i consolidated balance sheets as of december  and ii consolidated statements of operations for each of the years ended december   and iii consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity for the years ended december   and iv consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts  including  without limitation  the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by  among other things  the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  plans  may  will  should  anticipates or continues or the negative thereof of other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  continued ability to maintain positive cash flow from results of operations  continued evaluation of goodwill for impairment and the company s development and production of competitive technologies in our market sector  among others 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  the company s press releases and in oral statements made by or with the approval of authorized personnel 
the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of the company s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that the company believes are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions are made by management to assess the overall likelihood that an accounting estimate or assumption may require adjustment 
management assumptions have been reasonably accurate in the past  and future estimates or assumptions are likely to be calculated on the same basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a key consideration in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts has been  and will continue to be  our customer s payment history and aging of its accounts receivable balance 
for example  each additional allowance required on our accounts receivable would reduce our income by approximately income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if the ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
our deferred tax asset at december   aggregates approximately  we must continue to be profitable in order to be able to utilize this asset in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets  subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment not less than annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any such asset may be impaired 
the company s management evaluates the recoverability of such assets by estimating future cash flows 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition  is less than the carrying amount of the assets  management will recognize an impairment loss to the extent of the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of the assets 
sfas no 
requires that the company perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired on an annual basis unless events or circumstances warrant a more frequent assessment 
the impairment assessment involves  among other things  an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit based on the discounted cash flow methodology 
significant assumptions used in our analysis include annual revenue growth rate from to and a discount rate of approximately 
if the assessment indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the goodwill would be subject to an impairment loss adjustment 
if the impairment review of goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization  and other long lived assets differ significantly from actual results  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for example  a impairment adjustment on goodwill and other intangibles would reduce income by approximately  and  respectively

the company s note is interest free through june and will bear interest at the annual rate of beginning july the note requires twelve half yearly payments beginning december until maturity at june as a result  the company is not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and will not be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company is in a borrowing mode 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has one foreign subsidiary in germany 
the company does business in more than fifty countries and currently generates approximately of its revenues from outside north america 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which the company does business 
the company s total assets in its foreign subsidiary was million at december   translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the company also acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and  as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates

industry risk the electronic test and measurement industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross profit margins and profits  from year to year
