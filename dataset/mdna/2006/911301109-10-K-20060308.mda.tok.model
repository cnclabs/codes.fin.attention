item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements  the accompanying notes to the financial statements  and the other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview we are a specialty finance company engaged in non prime automobile finance 
we provide financing to borrowers who typically have limited or impaired credit histories that restrict their ability to obtain loans through traditional sources 
financing arms of automobile manufacturers generally do not make these loans to non prime borrowers  nor do many other traditional automotive lenders 
non prime borrowers generally pay higher interest rates and loan fees than do prime borrowers 
we conduct our automobile finance business through our direct wholly owned subsidiary uacc 
we purchase and hold for investment non prime automobile installment sales contracts  or automobile contracts  originated by independent and franchised automobile dealers 
we fund our business through warehouse financing and periodic securitizations 
we have a warehouse line of credit with deutsche bank to fund our ongoing operations 
this facility was originally million  and was increased to million in the first quarter of in september  we closed our first securitization composed of a million offering of automobile receivable backed securities 
in april  we closed our second securitization composed of a million offering of automobile receivable backed securities 
in december  we closed our third securitization composed of a million offering of automobile receivable backed securities 
we plan to price a new securitization approximately every six months 
our business strategy includes controlled expansion through a national retail branch network and branches are generally located in proximity to dealers and borrowers 
the branch manager of each branch is responsible for underwriting and purchasing automobile contracts and providing focused servicing and collections 
the branch network is closely managed and supervised by our regional managers and divisional vice presidents 
we believe that our branch network operations enable branch managers to develop strong relationships with our primary customers  the automobile dealers 
through our branches  we provide a high level of service to the dealers by providing consistent credit decisions  typically same day funding and frequent management contact 
we believe that this branch network and management structure also enhances our risk management and collection functions 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
securitization transactions the transfer of our automobile contracts to the securitization trust is treated as a secured financing under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  also known as gaap 
for gaap 
table of contents purposes  the contracts are retained on the balance sheet with the securities issued to finance the contracts recorded as securitization notes payable 
we record interest income on the securitized contracts and interest expense on the notes issued through the securitization transactions 
as servicer of these contracts  we remit funds collected from the borrowers on behalf of the trustee to the trustee and direct the trustee how the funds should be invested until the distribution dates 
we have retained an interest in the securitized contracts  and have the ability to receive future cash flows as a result of that retained interest 
allowance for loan losses our loan loss allowances are monitored by management based on a variety of factors including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of nonperforming loans  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
management also undertakes a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of charge off trends by loan type  analysis of cumulative losses and evaluation of credit loss experienced by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the concentration of any credit tier  the level of nonperformance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analysis includes trends in charge offs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossession and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
for automobile contracts purchased prior to january   we contributed all or a portion of the original discount to allowance for loan losses to estimate the expected losses over the life of the loan 
we account for such contracts by static pool  stratified into six month pools  so that the credit risk in each individual static pool can be evaluated independently  on a periodic basis  in order to estimate the future losses within each static pool over the remaining life of the loans 
additional provisions for credit losses for these pools purchased prior to were recognized immediately for pools where the remaining amount of the initial discount set aside was determined to be insufficient to cover losses expected to be incurred based on an analysis of projected losses during the entire life of the loans 
for all contracts purchased on or after january   we established our allowance for loan losses by using the expected month charge off method which establishes allowances based on the incurred loss method that sums the expected charge offs for the next months in each static loss pool 
for all contracts purchased on or after january   we also allocated the purchase price entirely to automobile contracts and unearned income at the date of purchase 
the unearned income is accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses is established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses at each reporting date 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing an allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of further events 
our operating results and financial conditions are sensitive to changes in our estimate for loan losses and the estimate s underlying assumptions 
our operating results and financial condition are immediately impacted as changes in estimates for calculating loan loss reserves immediately pass through our income statement as an additional provision expense 
management updates our loan loss estimates quarterly to reflect current charge offs 
derivatives and hedging activities the automobile contracts purchased and held by us are written at fixed interest rates and  accordingly  have interest rate risk while such contracts are funded with warehouse borrowings because the warehouse borrowings accrue interest at a variable rate 
prior to closing our first securitization  while we were shifting the funding source of our automobile finance business to the public capital markets through securitizations and warehouse facilities  we entered into forward agreements in order to reduce the interest rate risk exposure on our 
table of contents securitization notes payable 
the market value of these forward agreements was designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we were able to effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread for our automobile contracts held in portfolio prior to the sale of the securitization notes payable 
losses related to these agreements were recorded on our consolidated statements of operations during the quarter we held the forward agreements  because the derivative transactions did not meet the accounting requirements to qualify for hedge accounting in order to amortize them over the life of the automotive contracts 
we are not currently utilizing interest rate hedging instruments because we plan to enter into a new securitization every six months and therefore will only fund the acquisition of approximately six months of automobile contracts at variable interest rates with our warehouse facility prior to locking a gross interest rate spread through the sale of securitization notes payable at fixed interest rates 
discontinued operations overview prior to september  we engaged in three reportable segments automobile finance  insurance premium finance and banking 
as a result of the changes in our funding sources and the cancellation of the bank s federal thrift charter  in september we discontinued our insurance premium finance business and our banking operations 
accordingly  our insurance premium finance business and certain of our banking operations have been treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
insurance premium finance from may through september  one of our primary business segments was insurance premium finance 
in september  following the sale of all of the branches of our retail banking operation  we decided to discontinue our insurance premium finance operations to concentrate our efforts on our automobile finance business 
because of our decision to discontinue our insurance premium finance operations  related operating activity for the insurance premium finance business was reclassified and reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements beginning with the quarterly period ended september  the bank subsequently sold its portfolio of insurance premium finance loans on november  we entered into the insurance premium finance business through a management agreement  as amended  originally dated may with bpn corporation  or bpn 
under the management agreement  the bank would finance automobile and small business insurance premiums and bpn would market this financing primarily to independent insurance agents in california and serviced such insurance premium loans for the bank 
on november   the bank sold the portfolio of insurance premium finance loans to classicplan premium financing  inc  or classicplan  pursuant to a loan sale agreement dated november  by and among the bank  classicplan and bpn 
the bank sold the portfolio of loans at a nominal premium over par 
as part of the loan sale agreement  the bank and bpn agreed that the management agreement was novated and that classicplan was substituted for the bank in the management agreement  except that any indemnification rights and obligations of each of the bank and bpn under the management agreement were preserved with respect to any act  error or omission occurring or arising before november  banking prior to its dissolution  the bank was a federally chartered stock savings bank which historically had been the primary funding source for our automobile finance business 
because of the increasing regulatory requirements associated with financing our non prime automobile finance business mainly with insured deposits of the bank  we announced a plan in for the bank to exit its federal thrift charter and we also reduced our reliance on insured deposits of the bank by shifting the funding source of our business to securitizations and warehouse funding 

table of contents in july  the bank adopted a plan of voluntary dissolution to dissolve and ultimately exit its federal thrift charter 
the office of thrift supervision  or the ots  conditionally approved the plan in august  subject to the bank satisfying certain conditions imposed by the ots 
pursuant to the bank s plan of voluntary dissolution  we completed the sale of the bank s three retail branches located in california in september  the sale of the bank s brokered deposits in september  and the sale of the bank s outstanding internet certificates of deposit in february we have included the net gain on these sales  net of costs associated with the sales  as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
on march   we received confirmation that the fdic terminated the insured status of the bank effective february  on march   we received confirmation from the ots that the bank s federal charter was cancelled effective february  in connection with the bank s plan of voluntary dissolution and to facilitate its dissolution  we irrevocably guaranteed all of the bank s remaining obligations 
the normal net operating costs and interest expense on deposits of the bank have not been reclassified as discontinued operations from prior periods because the associated loans funded by these deposits are not discontinued and the cost of the replacement funds from the securitization and the warehouse line are very similar to the net cost of deposits including operating costs 
results of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for the increase in net income was due primarily to a million increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses  which increased to million in from million in  and a million increase in non interest income  partially offset by a million increase in non interest expense  a million increase in the provision for loan losses  a million increase in income taxes and a million decrease in income from discontinued operations 
net interest income was favorably impacted by the continued expansion and growth of our automobile finance business 
automobile contracts purchased increased million to million in from million in  as a result of the growth of our automobile finance business 
interest income interest income increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million increase in average automobile contracts and a basis point increase in average interest on securities and short term investments  partially offset by a million decrease in average securities 
the increase in automobile contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of these operations 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from million in due to a basis point increase in weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the largest components of the decrease in interest bearing liabilities were repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements had an average balance of million in compared to an average balance of million in as a result of our decision to decrease the amount of securities funded with repurchase agreements 
securitization notes payable had an average balance of million in compared to million in because we closed two additional securitizations in warehouse borrowings had an average balance of million in compared to million in because of funding of new automobile contracts partially offset by the two securitizations in

while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio

table of contents annualized net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in net charge offs to average loans was due primarily to a million increase in average automobile installment contracts 
for more information  see critical accounting policies 
non interest income non interest income increased million to million in from million in  due principally to an increase in net gain on sale of securities of million 
non interest expense non interest expense increased million to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by an increase in salaries  employee benefit costs and occupancy expenses associated with the growth of our automobile finance business 
during  we continued with the planned expansion of our automobile finance operations  resulting in an increase to employees in branches as of december   from employees in branches as of december  during we recognized a loss in market value of million on derivative instruments used to hedge our interest rate risk in our fixed rate loan portfolio 
for more information  see critical accounting policies 
income taxes income taxes increased million to million in from million in this increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in taxable income from continuing operations before income taxes 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for during the third quarter of  we shifted the funding source of our automobile finance business from retail and wholesale deposits of the bank to the public capital markets through securitizations and warehouse facilities 
the effect of this change in our funding source on our balance sheet has been a decline in deposit liabilities and a corresponding increase in securitized borrowings and warehouse liabilities 
interest income in increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million in from million in gross automobile receivables were million at december  compared to million at december   accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
interest income interest income  including discontinued operations  increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets and a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile contracts  which increased million in  and investment securities  which increased million in the increase in automobile contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 

table of contents the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to a general increase in the market interest rates and the increase in the percentage of assets held in loans  which have higher yields compared to securities 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets for as part of our ongoing review and analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting for sarbanes oxley compliance  management discovered that  due to a programming error in the company s computer based accounting systems  the systems failed to properly reverse accrued interest on certain charged off accounts since also  management determined that the accretion of discount on purchased loans did not properly reflect the level yield method of reporting interest income and the methodology used to implement practice bulletin prior to january  was incorrect 
during those years  any expected credit loss over the life of a pool of loans in excess of the amount of discount on purchased loans was treated as an adjustment of interest income over the life of the loans  when it should properly have been charged to provision for loan losses 
consequently  this led to a decision to restate our financial statements for the years ended december   and and subsequent interim periods to correct the impact of unreversed accrued interest on these charged off accounts 
interest expense interest expense  including discontinued operations  increased to million in from million in  due to a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities 
the largest components of the increase in interest bearing liabilities were securitization notes payable  warehouse borrowings and repurchase agreements 
securitization notes payable had an average balance of million in compared to zero in because we closed our first securitization in september warehouse borrowings had an average balance of million in compared to zero in because we entered into our first warehouse facility in september repurchase agreements had an average balance of million in compared to an average balance of million in the increase in average repurchase agreements was due primarily to our increased use of wholesale borrowings to fund the purchase of investment securities to meet the qtl test under federal regulatory requirements during the first nine months ended september

financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets decreased million  to  million at december  from  million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in securities available for sale to million at december  from million at december  and a million decrease in assets of discontinued operations  partially offset by a million increase in loans to million at december  from million at december  and a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
securities available for sale decreased as a result of our decision to decrease the amount of securities funded with repurchase agreements 
the increase in loans principally resulted from the purchasing of additional automobile contracts in existing and new markets consistent with planned growth in our automobile finance business 
during  we opened new branches for a total of branches at december  premises and equipment increased million to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of opening new branches in consistent with planned growth in our automobile finance business

securitization notes payable increased to million at december  from at december  due to the completion of a million securitization in april and a million securitization in december  partially offset by payments on the automobile contracts backing the securitized borrowing 
repurchase agreements decreased million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease is the result of excess funds from pay downs and maturities in the securities portfolio  as well as the sale of a portion of the securities portfolio  which were used to repay repurchase agreements 

table of contents shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of net income of million in and million additional capital obtained as of result of stock options exercised  partially offset by million unrealized loss on securities available for sale 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets decreased million  to  million at december  from  million at december  the decrease occurred primarily as a result of a million decrease in securities available for sale  which decreased to million at december  from  million at december  partially offset by a million increase in loans  which increased to million at december  from million at december  securities available for sale decreased as a result of our decision to decrease the amount of securities funded with repurchase agreements

deposits decreased million  to million at december  from million at december  the deposit decrease is a result of our decision to exit the thrift charter and to fund our operations with commercial securitizations and warehouse borrowings 
securitization notes payable increased to million at december  due to the completion of our initial securitization of automobile contracts in the third quarter of as part of our plan to eliminate the reliance on insured deposits as our funding source and to discontinue the banking operations 
warehouse line of credit borrowing increased to million at december  due to the implementation of our first warehouse borrowing facility in the third quarter of as part of our plan to eliminate the reliance on insured deposits as our funding source and to discontinue the banking operations 
repurchase agreements decreased million to million at december  as compared with  million at december this decrease is the result of excess funds from pay downs and maturities in the securities portfolio  as well as the sale of a portion of the securities portfolio  which were used to repay repurchase agreements 
shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of our profit of million and a million increase from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits in  partially offset by a million increase in unrealized gain on securities 
management of interest rate risk the principal objective of our interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given our operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by our board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
our profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans which we originate and the interest rates paid on our financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 

table of contents the automobile contracts purchased and held by us are written at fixed interest rates and  accordingly  have interest rate risk while such contracts are funded with warehouse borrowings because the warehouse borrowings accrue interest at a variable rate 
prior to closing our first securitization  while we were shifting the funding source of our automobile finance business to the public capital markets through securitizations and warehouse facilities  we entered into forward agreements in order to reduce the interest rate risk exposure on our securitization notes payable 
the market value of these forward agreements was designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rate 
because of this inverse relationship  we were able to effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread for our automobile contracts held in portfolio prior to the sale of the securitization notes payable 
losses related to these agreements were recorded on our consolidated statements of operations during the quarter we purchased the forward agreements  because the derivative transactions did not meet the accounting requirements to qualify for hedge accounting in order to amortize them over the life of the automotive contracts 
we are not currently utilizing interest rate hedging instruments because we plan to enter into a new securitization every six months and therefore will only fund the acquisition of approximately six months of automobile contracts at variable interest rates with our warehouse facility prior to locking a gross interest rate spread through the sale of securitization notes payable at fixed interest rates 
all of our investments are in united states government or agency guaranteed debt and display minimal credit risk 
any price impairments are caused by movements in market interest rates  which can also cause variation in expected prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
liquidity and capital resources general we require substantial cash and capital resources to operate our business 
our primary funding sources are warehouse credit lines  securitizations and retained earnings 
our primary uses of cash include acquisition of automobile contracts  interest expense  operating expenses  and securitization costs 
the capital resources available to us include interest income on automobile contracts  servicing fees that we earn under our securitizations  releases of excess cash from the spread accounts relating to the securitizations  securitization proceeds  borrowings under our credit facilities  releases of excess cash from our warehouse facilities  commercial repurchase agreements  and equity in our securities portfolio in excess of corresponding repurchase agreements 
management believes that the resources available to us will provide the needed capital to fund purchases of automobile contracts  investments in our branch network and servicing capabilities and ongoing operations 

table of contents securitizations we completed our first securitization in the third quarter of  our second securitization in the second quarter of and our third securitization in the fourth quarter of these securitizations are structured as on balance sheet transactions  recorded as secured financings 
regular contract securitizations are an integral part of our business plan going forward in order to increase our liquidity and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we have developed a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of our automobile contracts to investors through the public issuance of aaa aaa rated asset backed securities 
upon the issuance of securitization notes payable  we retain the right to receive over time excess cash flows from the underlying pool of securitized automobile contracts 
in our securitizations to date  we transferred automobile contracts we purchased from new and used automobile dealers to a newly formed owner trust for each transaction  which trust then issued the securitization notes payable 
the net proceeds of our first securitization were used to replace the bank s deposit liabilities and the net proceeds of our subsequent securitization transactions were used to fund our operations 
at the time of securitization of our automobile contracts  we are required to pledge assets equal to a specific percentage of the securitization pool to support the securitization transaction 
typically  the assets pledged consist of cash deposited to a restricted account known as a spread account and additional receivables delivered to the trusts  which create overcollateralization 
the securitization transaction documents require the percentage of assets pledged to support the transaction to increase over time until a specific level is attained 
excess cash flow generated by the trusts are added to the spread account or used to pay down outstanding debt of the trusts  increasing the level of overcollateralization until the required percentage level of assets has been reached 
once the required percentage level of assets is reached and maintained  excess cash flows generated by the trusts are released to us as distribution from the trusts 
additionally  as the principal balance level of the securitization pool declines  the amount of pledged assets needed to maintain the required percentage level is reduced  thereby permitting additional excess cash to be released to us as distribution from the trusts 
to improve the achievable securitization advance rate from the sale of securitized automobile contracts  we have arranged for credit enhancement to improve the credit rating on the asset backed securities issued 
this credit enhancement for our securitizations has been in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies insuring the payment of principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
agreements with our financial guaranty insurance insurers provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency and net charge offs as a percentage of automobile contract outstanding in a trust s pool of automobile contracts exceed certain targets  the overcollateralization and spread account levels would be increased 
agreements with our financial guaranty insurance insurers also contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any trust whose securities are insured were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit our financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate our servicing right to the automobile contracts sold to that trust 
warehouse facility as of december  we were party to one million warehouse facility  which we use to fund our automobile finance operations to purchase automobile contracts pending securitization 
under the terms of the facility  our indirect subsidiary  ufc  may obtain advances on a revolving basis by issuing notes to the participating lenders and pledging for each advance a portfolio of automobile contracts 
ufc purchases the automobile contracts from uacc and uacc services the automobile contracts  which are held by a custodian 
we have provided an absolute and unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance  of all liabilities  agreements and other obligations of uacc and ufc under the warehouse facility 
whether we may obtain further advances under the facility depends on  among other things  the performance of the automobile contracts that are pledged under the facility and whether we comply with certain financial covenants contained in the sale and servicing agreement 
we were in compliance with the terms of such financial 
table of contents covenants as of december  the principal and interest collected on the automobile contracts pledged is used to pay the principal and interest due each month on the notes to the participating lenders and any excess cash is released to ufc 
the performance  timing and amount of cash flows from automobile contracts varies based on a number of factors  including the yields received on automobile contracts  the rates and amounts of loan delinquencies  defaults and net credit losses  and how quickly and at what price repossessed vehicles can be resold 
other sources of funds the collection of principal and interest from automobile contracts purchased and securitized and the release of cash from the securitization spread accounts are other sources of significant funds for us 
pursuant to the securitization documents  we receive cash released from a spread account for a securitization transaction once the spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
the amount released from a spread account over time represents the return of the initial deposits to such spread account as well as the release of the excess spread on the securitized automobile contracts in the related securitization transaction 
subordinated debentures in  we issued junior subordinated debentures in the amount of million to a subsidiary trust  upfc trust i  to enhance our liquidity
