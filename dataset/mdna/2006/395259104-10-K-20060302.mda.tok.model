merchant banking fund management  which currently consists primarily of management of greenhill s private equity funds  greenhill capital partners or gcp  and principal investments by greenhill in those funds 
historically  the majority of our revenues sources from our financial advisory business and we expect it to remain so for the near to medium term 
the main driver of the financial advisory business is overall mergers and acquisitions  or m a  and restructuring volume  particularly in the industry sectors and geographic markets in which we focus 
in addition  new managing director hires add incrementally to our revenue and income growth potential 
our merchant banking fund management revenues increased substantially in  primarily because of increased investments in merchant banking funds and increased participation in profit overrides derived from gcp investments made beginning in business environment economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
see risk factors 
net income and revenues in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory revenues were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
at the same time  worldwide completed merger and acquisition  or m a  volume increased by  from  billion in to  billion in  and aggregate advisory revenue reported by four leading investment banks that publicly disclose their advisory fee revenue increased by from billion in to billion in from a longer term perspective  our financial advisory revenues were higher than in  while the aggregate advisory revenue reported by those four leading firms was lower than in although we may benefit from any sustained increase in m a volume  we have been and will continue to be constrained by the relatively small size of our firm and we may not grow as rapidly as our principal competitors 
in addition  some of the benefits we expect to experience in connection with the recent increase in m a volume will be partially offset by the current decline in restructuring activity 
merchant banking and other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
merchant banking revenues principally consisted of realized and unrealized gains on investments in gcp  merchant banking profit overrides and management fees 
while the amount of management fees earned from our existing merchant banking funds are principally a function of the amount of capital invested in the case of gcp i or committed in the case of gcp ii  those portions of merchant banking revenues consisting of gains and profit overrides may vary considerably depending on economic conditions 
during  gcp s principal portfolio companies generated record earnings and profits  as well as revenue growth and margin improvement 
in addition  several gcp portfolio companies benefited from favorable conditions in the financing markets 
gcp s energy investments also benefited from strong commodity prices 
however  adverse changes in general economic conditions  commodity prices  credit and public equity markets could impact negatively the amount of merchant banking revenue realized by the firm

we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue  and each revenue generating engagement  which typically relates to only one potential transaction  is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  and our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we gain new clients each year through our business development initiatives  by recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
at the same time  we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
we earn a majority of our financial advisory revenue from completion fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a merger  acquisition  restructuring or similar transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing and failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
in certain client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  we earn a significant portion of our revenue in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment but are not necessarily linked to the end result 
we do not allocate our financial advisory revenue by type of advice rendered m a  restructuring or other because of the complexity of the assignments for which we earn revenue 
for example  a restructuring assignment can involve  and in some cases end successfully in  a sale of all or part of the financially distressed client 
likewise  an acquisition assignment can relate to a financially distressed target involved in or considering a restructuring 
finally  an m a assignment can be received from a relationship that derives from a prior restructuring assignment  and vice versa 
versus financial advisory revenues were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   which represents an increase of 
the increase reflected the benefit of an increase in m a market volume and our continued business development efforts  offset by the impact of a decline in the volume of financial distress related business

we began our merchant banking activities with the formation of our first fund  gcp i  in which had committed capital of million 
at the outset of that fund our managing directors committed capital to the fund and were awarded substantially all of the rights to receive overrides on profits that might be earned by the general partner of the fund 
for the period through our activities consisted principally of our management of the gcp i 
in we began to invest directly in gcp i by purchasing limited partnership interests 
in early our investment increased as a result of the assignment to us of a portion of the future commitments of our managing directors

also increased our economic share of the profit override of the fund to for all investments made on or after january  of the profit override is reflected in our revenues in accordance with our consolidation policy 
the remaining share of the profit overrides was retained by our employees and is reflected in compensation expense 
in aggregate we committed million to gcp i with a majority of our capital deployed for investments made subsequent to january  in march we expanded our merchant banking activities with the closing of our second fund  gcp ii 
we committed approximately million to gcp ii  or approximately of the committed capital of million  and our employees committed an additional million to gcp ii 
we are entitled to receive of the profit overrides for all investments made by gcp ii of the profit override  if any  is reflected in our revenues in accordance with our consolidation policy 
our employees are entitled to receive the remaining of the profit overrides 
see below for more information regarding our consolidation of the profit overrides 
we generate merchant banking revenue from i management fees paid by the funds  ii gains or losses on our investments in the merchant banking funds  and iii profit overrides 
we charge management fees in gcp i to all outside investors who are not employed or affiliated with us 
in gcp ii we charge fees to all investors except the firm 
management fees are charged based upon a percentage of committed capital generally during the year commitment period and as a percentage of invested capital generally after the termination of the commitment period 
as a result of the increase in committed capital to our funds following the closing of gcp ii our management fees increased substantially in to the extent we establish other funds we expect our management fee earnings to increase  notwithstanding the reduction in the fee percentage after the commitment period of each fund has been terminated 
our management fees also include portions of other transactions fees which may be paid directly to us by portfolio companies of the merchant banking funds 
we earned annual fees from gcp i of approximately million during the commitment period and for expect to earn approximately million in management fees from gcp i 
the amount of management fees earned from gcp i is dependent on the amount of invested capital and will decline over the remaining life of the fund as investments are liquidated a process which we expect will end by 
we currently earn annual fees from gcp ii of approximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
depending upon the performance of our funds  we will record investment income or losses based upon our allocable share of invested capital in our funds 
since we began investing in our funds in we have recognized realized and unrealized investment earnings from such funds 
prior to we realized investment earnings from our interest in barrow street capital  llc  a limited liability company that manages real estate merchant banking funds 
one of the managing principals of barrow street capital  llc is robert f 
greenhill  jr  son of robert greenhill  chairman and chief executive of greenhill 
the investment in barrow street capital  llc was sold to the managing principals of barrow street capital  llc in march for book value 
investment gains from the merchant banking activities are comprised of investment income  realized and unrealized gains from the firm s investment in gcp  and the consolidated earnings of the general partner in which we have a majority economic interest  offset by allocated expenses of the funds 
that portion of the earnings of the general partner which is held by employees of the firm is recorded as minority interest 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
we record our investments at estimated fair value 
investments in privately held companies are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value and generally adjusted after being held by the fund for one year to the estimated fair value as determined by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other financial data 
discounts are generally applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investment in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments 
significant changes in the fair value of our investments may have a material effect  positive or negative  on our revenues and thus the results of operations 
as the general partner of our merchant banking funds  we make investment decisions for the funds and are entitled to receive from the funds an override of the profits of the funds 
in aggregate  we and our employees are entitled to a profit override percentage of of the profits earned by unaffiliated investors in gcp i and generally for all investors except the firm in gcp ii 
we are deemed to have the majority of the economic interest in the managing general partner of gcp i and the general partner of gcp ii in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective for investments made beginning early 
under fin r we include as consolidated revenue all realized and unrealized profit overrides earned by the general partner of gcp 
from an economic perspective  profit overrides in respect of such investments are allocated to the firm and to employees of the firm 
the economic share of the profit overrides allocated to the employees of the firm is recorded as compensation expense 
for investments made prior to  we did not have a majority of the economic interest and only that portion of the profit override allocable directly to us  which ranges from  is included in our consolidated revenue 
because we include in our revenues all of the profit overrides earned from investments made on or after january   we expect that as the investments mature and depending upon market conditions  that the amount of our profit overrides could increase 
the amount of profit overrides we recognize as revenue will depend upon the underlying fair value of the portfolio company and is subject to the volatility referred to above 
versus in the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management other revenue compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of 
these increases are primarily due to higher asset management fees resulting from greater assets under management  higher dividend income and distributions of earnings from portfolio companies  higher realized and unrealized principal investment gains in the gcp portfolio  an increase in the recognized amounts of profit overrides associated with gains in the gcp portfolio and an increase in interest income 
gcp gains and losses relating to investments made in or later have a larger impact on firm revenue because of the firm s increased investment in  and increased participation in profit overrides relating to  gcp starting in early the firm had one investment that contributed more than to total revenues in and none in included in merchant banking fund management other revenue for the year ended december  is million related to the portion of the interests in the general partners of gcp which are held directly by employees of the firm  which is also deducted as minority interest 
versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking fund management other revenue compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of 
in  these revenues were principally comprised of asset management fees earned from greenhill capital partners of million  unrealized investment gains and profit overrides earned on investments made in greenhill capital partners of million and million  respectively  other unrealized investment income of million and interest income of million 
in comparison  in  the merchant banking fund management other revenue revenues were principally comprised of asset management fees of million and interest income of million 
the principal driver of growth in merchant banking fund management other revenue revenues in were unrealized investment gains and profit overrides on investments made in greenhill capital partners 
operating expenses our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  which compares to pro forma total operating expenses of million for the increase of million  or  relates primarily to compensation expense which is paid as a percentage of revenue and is described in more detail below 
the pre tax income margin for the year ended december  was compared to for on a pro forma basis 
we classify operating expenses as compensation and benefits expense and non compensation expenses 
management does not separately evaluate operating expenses by financial advisory and merchant banking activities 
the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
because we were a limited liability company prior to our initial public offering in may  payments for services rendered by our managing directors prior to our initial public offering were generally accounted for as distributions of members capital or minority interest expense rather than as compensation expense 
as a result  our pre initial public offering compensation and benefits expense did not reflect a large portion of payments for services rendered by our managing directors and therefore understates our operating costs as a public company 
as a corporation  we now include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors in compensation and benefits expense 
operating expenses apart from compensation have been modest in proportion to revenues  as a result of the relatively small number of staff and related costs including travel  office space  communications  information services  depreciation and professional services that greenhill bears 
a portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements 
in addition  barrow street capital reimburses us for certain occupancy related costs  health care premiums and other costs incurred by us 
the following table sets forth information relating to our actual and pro forma operating expenses  which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients and merchant banking portfolio companies

amounts for the year ended december  reflect pro forma expenses 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information on the pro forma adjustments 
compensation and benefits the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
it is our policy that our total compensation and benefits  including that payable to our managing directors and senior advisors  will not exceed of total revenues each year although we retain the ability to change this policy in the future 
because we were a limited liability company prior to our initial public offering  payments for services rendered by our managing directors generally were accounted for as distributions of members capital or minority interest expense rather than as compensation expense 
as a result  our pre initial public offering compensation and benefits expense did not reflect a large portion of payments for services rendered by our managing directors and understates the expected operating costs to be incurred as a public company 
as a corporation  we include all payments for services rendered by our managing directors in compensation and benefits expense 
one factor in determining the compensation expense ratio in and was the accounting impact of the introduction into our compensation packages of equity related compensation in the form of restricted stock units 
as a public company  the compensation we pay to our employees consists of base salary and benefits  cash bonus awards and the award of restricted stock units 
base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year 
cash bonuses  which are accrued each period  are discretionary and dependent upon on number of factors  including the performance of the firm 
discretionary cash bonus payments are paid annually in february following year end 
awards of restricted stock units are also discretionary and amortized to compensation expense based upon the value of the award at the time of grant during the service period over which the award vests  which is generally five years 
as we expense these awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
in january  our employees were granted  restricted stock units in conjunction with the compensation 
versus our total compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year 
this compares against million of pro forma total compensation and benefits expense  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year ended december  this represents an increase of in total compensation and benefits expense  and is principally related to the increase in revenues for the year and the increase in the compensation ratio resulting from the amortization charge for awards of restricted stock units 
as restricted stock unit awards vest over future years  it is expected that the compensation ratio will gradually increase 
our actual compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million 
versus our pro forma total compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  was million  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year 
this compares against million of pro forma total compensation and benefits expense  which reflects a compensation ratio for the year ended december  this represents an increase of in total compensation and benefits expense  and is related to the increase in revenues for the period 
our actual compensation and benefits expense for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
non compensation expense our non compensation expense includes the costs for occupancy and rental  communications  information services  professional fees  recruiting  travel and entertainment  insurance  depreciation and other operating expenses 
reimbursable client expenses are netted against non compensation expenses 
as a public company  our costs for such items as insurance and professional fees  principally accounting and legal advice have increased 
we also expect that our non compensation costs will increase as we grow our business and make strategic investments 
for  our occupancy expenses and depreciation expenses will increase for new office space in new york  london and dallas 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase is related principally to a third party fee related to the fundraising for greenhill capital partners ii million  greater travel million and information services million as a result of additional personnel and business development activity  increase in occupancy costs million  the net write off of uncollectible accounts million and increases in professional fees primarily associated with operating as a public company million  offset in part by lower depreciation expense million primarily due to full depreciation of the airplane in and the absence of a one time transaction specific consultancy expense reflected in expenses million 
non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  was 
this compares to for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in as compared to reflects a small increase in actual non compensation costs spread over greater revenue 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of revenue was principally related to the expansion of our office space million  increases in recruiting efforts million  the costs of being a public company million  an increase in net travel expense million and a transaction specific consultancy expense million in conjunction with a client engagement 
in addition  non us operating costs increased approximately million due to the decline in the relative value of the us dollar compared to the comparable period in non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  was 
this compares to for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  primarily related to an increase in the aforementioned costs 
the firm s non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue can vary as a result of a variety of factors  including fluctuation in quarterly revenue amounts  the amount of recruiting and business development activity  the amount of reimbursement of engagement related expenses by clients  currency movements and other factors 
accordingly  the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
provision for income taxes as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in may  we are subject to federal  foreign and state corporate income taxes 
prior to our initial public offering  greenhill was a limited liability company and was generally not subject to us federal or state income taxes and its us controlled affiliate greenhill co 
international llp  as a limited liability partnership  was generally not subject to uk income taxes 
however  greenhill was subject to local taxes on its us earnings 
in addition  certain of greenhill s non us subsidiaries have been subject to income taxes in their local jurisdictions 
versus for the year ended december   our provision for taxes was million  at an effective tax rate of 
for the year ended december   the pro forma provision for taxes of million reflected an assumed tax rate of 
the pro forma provision for taxes for the year ended december  includes assumed federal  foreign  state and local income taxes as if we were a c corporation for the period january  to the date of the public offering at an assumed effective rate of combined with the actual tax provision for the period after the public offering 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to reflects the benefit of a higher proportion of investment income and uk based advisory income  which generally are taxed at lower rates than us based advisory income 
our actual effective tax rate for was reflecting our status as a c corporation for the period between our public offering and december  
actual tax expense for the year ended december  was million 
versus for the year ended december   our pro forma provision for taxes was million  or a rate of 
the pro forma provision for taxes for the year ended december  includes assumed federal  foreign  state and local income taxes as if we were a c corporation for the period january  to the date of the public offering at an assumed effective rate of combined with the actual tax provision for the period after the public offering 
for the year ended december   the pro forma provision for taxes of million reflected an assumed tax rate of 
the decrease in the pro forma effective tax rate in resulted principally from an increase in investment earnings  which are taxed at lower rates 
our actual effective tax rate for was reflecting our status as a c corporation for the period between our public offering and december  
actual tax expense for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the relative amounts of advisory and merchant banking income earned in the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates and invests 
accordingly  the effective tax rate in any particular period may not be indicative of the effective tax rate in future periods 
geographic data for a summary of the total revenues  income before minority interest and tax  net income and total assets of greenhill by geographic region  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position is monitored by our management committee  which generally meets monthly 
the management committee monitors cash  other significant working capital assets and liabilities  debt  principal investment commitments and other matters relating to liquidity requirements 
as cash accumulates it is invested in short term liquid investments 
we generate cash from both our operating activities in the form of advisory fees and our merchant banking investments in the form of distributions of investment proceeds and profit overrides 
we use our cash primarily for operating purposes  compensation of our employees  payment of income taxes  investments in merchant banking funds  payment of dividends  repurchase of shares of our stock and leasehold improvements 
our cash balances generally accumulate from our operating activities during the year 
in general  we collect our accounts receivable within days except for certain restructuring transactions where collections may take longer due to court ordered holdbacks 
our liabilities typically consist of accounts payable  which are generally paid monthly  accrued compensation  which includes accrued bonuses that are paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees  and taxes payable 
in the first quarter of  cash bonuses of million relating to compensation were paid to our employees 
in addition  we expect to pay approximately million in early related to income taxes owed for the year ended december  a large portion of our liabilities are associated with unrealized earnings ie  recorded on our books but for which cash proceeds have not yet been received from our merchant banking investments 
at december  approximately million of our bonus accrual related to profit overrides for unrealized gains of gcp and million related to deferred tax liabilities that are deferred until the gains from the gcp investments are realized 
these amounts may increase or decrease depending on the change in the fair value of the gcp funds and are payable  subject to claw back  at the time the funds realize cash proceeds 
since our initial public offering we have used a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock and make investments in our merchant banking funds 
our commitments to our merchant banking funds may require us to fund capital calls on short notice 
on the other hand  distributions from our merchant banking funds are generally made shortly after proceeds are received by the funds 
we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of share repurchase opportunities  capital call requirements or distribution of investment proceeds 
our merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies 
the ability of our merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds  including general economic and sector conditions  stock market conditions  the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities  among others 
as a result we consider our investments illiquid for the short term 
because it is not tax efficient  our foreign earnings are generally not available to fund our us working capital needs  including share purchases  dividend payments or merchant banking investments 
however  in december we elected to repatriate million of foreign earnings under a domestic reinvestment plan pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
these funds were repatriated to take advantage of a one time tax reduction that was available under the american jobs creation act of to increase our financial flexibility  on january   we obtained from a us commercial bank an unsecured million revolving loan facility to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of merchant banking investments and other general corporate purposes 
interest on borrowings is based on libor plus 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on august  as of december   we had total commitments not reflected on our balance sheet relating to future principal investments in gcp and other merchant banking activities of million excluding million repaid to the company related to interim financings and expenses which may be recalled 
these commitments are expected to be drawn on from time to time and be substantially invested over a period of up to five years from the relevant commitment dates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
during  the firm repurchased  shares of its common stock in open market purchases at an average price of per share 
in august  the firm purchased  of our common shares at a price of per share from a former employee pursuant to a previously announced agreement 
in addition  in december  we agreed to repurchase  shares of our common stock from a former employee at a discount to market price 
we completed these repurchases early in in january  the board of directors of greenhill co  inc authorized the repurchase an additional million of common stock in open market transactions 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and funds available from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  commitments to our merchant banking activities  build out costs of new office space  tax obligations  share repurchases and common dividends 
in the event that our needs for liquidity should increase as we expand our business  we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased by million in we generated million from operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to the non cash items and by a net increase in working capital of million principally from the accrual of compensation expense  accounts payable and accrued expenses and taxes payable 
we generated million from investing activities  including million from the net sale of securities and million from distributions from our merchant banking investments  partially offset by million in new investments in merchant banking funds 
we used million for financing activities  including million for the payment of dividends and million for the repurchase of our common stock 
cash increased million in cash of million was provided by operating activities  including million from net income after giving effect to non cash items and a net change in working capital of million principally from an increase in accrued compensation payable offset by the payout of the prior year s minority interest in the net assets of our uk affiliate of million 
we used cash generated from operations principally to fund distributions to members of earnings prior to the initial public offering of million  dividend payments of million  and million in purchases of property and equipment  primarily for the build out of additional office space in new york 
proceeds from our initial public offering of million were used to fund an investment of million in greenhill capital partners  net of a distribution received from greenhill capital partners of million  repay net borrowings under the credit facility of million  repurchase million of our common stock  invest million in highly rated short term auction rate securities and invest the remaining increase in cash in highly rated short term debt securities 
cash increased to million in cash of million was provided by operating activities  including million from net income  million from a decrease in accounts receivables and million from an increase in minority interest in the net assets of our uk affiliate 
cash of million was used for investing activities  primarily for the purchase from outside investors of a portion of greenhill capital partners limited partner interest and technology related expenditures 
financing activities used million of cash  reflecting distributions to members offset by a small increase in short term borrowings

a we may be required to substantially fund our merchant banking commitments at any time through  depending on the timing and level of investments by greenhill capital partners  although we do not expect these commitments to be drawn in full 
since the merchant banking commitments can be drawn at any time over the life of the commitment period  the amounts above are shown as if spread ratably over the life of the primary commitment period 
excludes million repaid to the company related to interim financings and expenses which may be recalled 
in addition  in december  we agreed to repurchase  shares of our common stock from a former employee 
we completed these repurchases early in at a total cost of million 
in  a subsidiary of gcp i entered into a credit agreement with morgan stanley mortgage capital  inc  as administrative agent  and pursuant to which they have borrowed million  secured by  shares of global signal inc common stock owned by it 
under the terms of a separate recourse agreement  the lenders will have recourse to greenhill capital partners  llc in the event of fraud or intentional or grossly negligent misrepresentations by the borrower or the institution of insolvency proceedings by or against the borrower  greenhill capital partners llc or the general partners of gcp i 
proceeds from the loans were used to fund distributions to gcp i s limited partners  which include executive officers of greenhill and the firm 
the credit agreement matures in august on january   the firm obtained from a us commercial bank an unsecured million revolving loan facility to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of short term investments and other general corporate purposes 
interest on borrowings is based on one month libor plus 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on august   but may be extended by a written agreement of lender and borrower 
market risk we limit our investments to short term cash investments  which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk  equity price risk or other market risk and principal investments in greenhill capital partners and other merchant banking funds 
we have invested our cash in short duration  highly rates fixed income investments including highly rated short term debt securities and money market funds 
changes in interest rates and other economic and market conditions could affect these investments adversely  however  we do not believe that any such changes will have a material effect on our results of operations 
our short term cash investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  uk sterling and euros  and we face modest foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in non us dollar denominated accounts 
to the extent that the cash balances in local currency exceed our short term obligations  we may hedge our foreign currency exposure 
with regard to our principal investments including our portion of any profit overrides earned on such investments  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which our merchant banking funds invest  which historically has been volatile 
significant changes in the public equity markets may have a material effect on our results of operations 
we have analyzed our potential exposure to general equity market risk by performing sensitivity analyses on our principal investments 
significant volatility in the general equity markets would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of our merchant banking investments that are publicly traded securities or are privately held securities owned for more than one year 
our analysis showed that if we assume that at december   the market prices of all public securities  and therefore  the general equity market  were lower  the impact on our operations would be a decrease in revenues of million 
we do not believe there would be any other material impact 
we meet on a quarterly basis to determine the fair value of the investments held in our merchant banking portfolio and to discuss the risks associated with those investments 
the investment committee manages the risks associated with the merchant banking portfolio by closely monitoring and managing the types of investments made as well as the monetization and realization of existing investments 
in addition  the reported amounts of our revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the euro and pound sterling in which of our revenues for the year ended december  were denominated and the dollar  in which our financial statements are denominated 
we do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates 
we analyzed our potential exposure to a decline in exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income 
we do not believe we face any material risk in this respect 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their footnotes  including investment valuations  compensation accruals and other matters 
management believes that the estimates used in preparing its consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses greenhill s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
basis of financial information the firm s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and related footnotes  including investment valuations  compensation accruals and other matters 
we believe that the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the consolidated financial statements of the firm include all consolidated accounts and greenhill co  inc formerly holdings and all other entities in which we have a controlling interest  including greenhill co 
international llp  after eliminations of all significant inter company accounts and transactions 
we adopted the revised financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  in the first quarter of fin r defines variable interests and specifies the circumstances under which the consolidation of entities will be required 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with fin r the firm consolidates the general partner of our merchant banking funds in which we have a majority of the economic interest 
the firm does not consolidate the merchant banking funds since the firm  through its general partner and limited partner interests  does not have a majority of the economic interest in such funds and under eitf no 
 accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights  is subject to removal by a simple majority of unaffiliated third party investors 
revenue recognition financial advisory fees we recognize advisory fee revenue when the services related to the underlying transactions are completed in accordance with the terms of the respective engagement letters 
retainer fees are generally recognized as advisory fee income over the period the services are rendered 
our clients reimburse certain out of pocket expenses incurred by us in the conduct of advisory engagements 
expenses are reported net of such client reimbursements 
merchant banking fund management revenues merchant banking fund management revenue consists of i management fees on our merchant banking activities  ii gains or losses on investments in our merchant banking funds and other principal investment activities and iii merchant banking profit overrides 
fund management fees are recognized over the period of related service 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
investments held by merchant banking funds are recorded at estimated fair value 
investments in privately held companies are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value and generally adjusted after being held by the fund for one year to the estimated fair value as determined by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other financial data 
discounts are generally applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any legal or contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investment in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments 
we recognize merchant banking profit overrides when certain financial returns are achieved over the life of the fund 
profit overrides are calculated as a percentage of the profits over a specified threshold earned by such funds on investments managed on behalf of unaffiliated investors of gcp i and all principally investors except the firm of gcp ii and are subject to clawback 
future losses in the value of the fund s investments may require amounts previously recognized as profit overrides to be reversed to the fund in future periods 
accordingly  merchant banking profit overrides are recognized as revenue only after material contingencies have been resolved 
restricted stock units in accordance with the fair value method prescribed by fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  restricted stock units with future service requirements are recorded as compensation expense and generally is amortized over a five year service period following the date of grant 
compensation expense is determined at the date of grant 
as the firm expenses the awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
the firm records dividend equivalents in stockholders equity on outstanding restricted stock units that are expected to vest 
the firm adopted statement r as of january   and it did not have a material effect on the accounting for restricted stock units in its consolidated financial statements 
provision for taxes after the initial public offering  the firm accounts for taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
prior to the initial public offering  the firm was primarily subject to local unincorporated business tax on business conducted in new york city  and income tax on current income realized by certain foreign subsidiaries
