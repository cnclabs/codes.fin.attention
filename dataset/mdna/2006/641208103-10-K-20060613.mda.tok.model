a forward looking statement may contain words such as plans  hopes  believes  estimates  will  continue to  expect to  anticipate that  to be  or can affect 
forward looking statements are based upon management expectations  forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
many factors may cause actual results to vary  including  but not limited to  the factors identified in this discussion

investors should carefully review the risk factors described in this document along with other documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission sec 
significant accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
such estimates and assumptions  which we evaluate on an on going basis  include  but are not limited to assumptions related to contracts that have multiple elements  the allowances for sales returns and potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  the valuation of inventory  warranty costs  the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  certain reserves and accruals  and assumptions related to stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products and services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
we recognize product revenue generally upon shipment  when all four of the following criteria are met we have a contract with our customer  when delivery has occurred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when our price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for transactions where we have not yet obtained customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
where product revenue has been deferred  we generally defer the associated cost of goods until the product revenue is recognized 
revenue for installation or other services such as training is recognized upon completion of the service 
maintenance contract revenue is typically recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all t he undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
allowance for sales returns a reserve for sales returns is established based on actual product returns 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and our operating expenses could be adversely affected 
credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable that were established 
inventory provisions inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to make adjustments to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
due to the decline in demand for our products in fiscal  we increased our inventory reserves for potential excess inventory to of gross manufacturing inventory at march  from at march  warranty accruals we generally provide a warranty for hardware product and software for twelve months 
the software warranty entitles the customer to bug fixes but not software upgrades during the warranty period 
we accrue warranty expense based on historical expense trends calculated as a percentage of new product sales 
actual expenses are charged against the accrual in the period they are incurred 
on a quarterly basis  the warranty accrual is analyzed for adequacy based on actual trends and subsequent adjustments are made to the liability balance 
if actual return rates or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
historically  all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  we do not record an expense for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
stock based compensation related to non employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis under fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of each individual award 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award rather than apply the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb the actual effects of adopting sfas r will depend on numerous factors and assumptions including the valuation model we choose to value stock based awards  the rate of forfeitures we assume  the method by which we recognize the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  which is usually the vesting period  and the transition method we choose for adopting sfas r 
we expect to use the modified prospective application method and the black scholes pricing model 
under the modified prospective application method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas we have not yet fully quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas r  but expect that the new standard may result in significant stock based compensation expense 
we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosure under sfas to mitigate the effect on the company s financial statements  on march   the board of directors approved accelerating the vesting of employee stock options that had exercise prices above 
the closing price of net s common stock on this date was 
as a result   shares became immediately vested  at a weighted average exercise price of 
these shares represented of the total unvested options immediately prior to the acceleration 
the accelerated options included certain options held by executive officers of net  but no options held by members of the board of directors 
deferred taxes we have incurred tax losses in prior fiscal years and  at march   we have an estimated million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state operating loss carryforwards available expiring in the years through we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  given the uncertainty as to their realization 
in future years  these benefits are available to reduce or eliminate taxes on future taxable income 
current federal and state tax laws include provisions that could limit the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards in the event of certain defined changes in stock ownership 
our issuances of common and preferred stock could result in such a change 
accordingly  the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited by these provisions  and this limitation may result in the loss of carryforward bene fits to the extent the above limit portion expires before it can be used 
we have not yet determined the extent of the limitation  if any 
changes to previously announced fiscal fourth quarter and annual results on april   we announced our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results 
subsequent to that date  our special accounting consultants completed their review of our compliance with our general services administration gsa schedule contract and provided an estimate of the company s potential liability arising under the contract 
the contract is presently up for renewal and as part of the renewal process the government performed a pre award audit  which identified a number of possible discrepancies regarding the company s compliance with the current contract 
in response  the company  with the assistance of special counsel and a big four accounting firm retained as special accounting consultants  conducted an internal review of compliance from january to december the internal review  which was completed in may  identified various compliance discrepancies throughout the review period  in cluding discrepancies regarding the pricing requirements of the contract 
based on the results of the internal review  which we have voluntarily reported to the gsa  we accrued a liability of  and reduced revenue by the same amount  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for an expected restitution payment to the government 
below is a reconciliation of the effects of this change on the reported results in our april  press release to amounts reported in this annual report on form k in thousands  except per share amounts quarter ended march  year ended march  k as previously reported increase decrease k as previously reported increase decrease revenue product service and other total revenue gross margin loss from operations loss before taxes net loss basic and diluted net loss per share results of operations the following table depicts selected data derived from our consolidated condensed statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented fiscal year ended percent of revenue march march march product service and other total revenue product gross margin service and other gross margin total gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructure and other costs total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense gain on sale of federal services business other income expense  net loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net loss overview and highlights promina product sales and sales to the government sector have declined but still account for the substantial majority of our revenue 
sales of our promina product have declined as the government and other customers continue to move to broadband  ip based communications and as the number of operational systems deployed in government programs that incorporate our promina systems declined 
our promina product provides ip capabilities but its reliance on circuit switching limits its use to narrowband networking 
we expect sales to the government sector will continue to decline over time as customers move from narrowband  circuit switched network products to high bandwidth systems based on ip 
our newer products  the nx and vx series  are aimed at these new ip based applications  but we do not expect to generate revenue from these products until the second half of fiscal  and then at low levels until these products are ordered and delivered in volume 
a comparison of revenue from our promina product and government customers is as follows year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy promina product revenue of product revenue revenue from government customers of total revenue our vx series products are targeted to advanced voip applications  principally in the enterprise and government markets 
the vx series  which leverages features of our shout product for a universal voice exchange platform  offers enterprise customers a voip solution that interoperates with existing pbx and ip pbx systems 
these products have been used for applications such as migration of existing pbx networks to voip technology and secure communications using voip 
the vx series can be deployed in distributed networks to reduce and consolidate pbx infrastructure 
the vx series is well suited for certain government applications that use more expensive bandwidth  such as satellite communications 
we continue to reduce costs and expenses 
total operating expenses in fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal included additional operating expenses of approximately  due to an additional week in fiscal as compared to the usual week fiscal year 
our cash position remains strong 
total cash  which includes cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  was million at march  this compares to million at march   which included  in long term restricted cash related to our fremont  california facility lease and performance guarantees on customer contracts  and million at march  revenue year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy product service and other total revenue the decrease in total revenue in each year is due primarily to a decrease in product revenue  although service and other revenue also declined each year 
the decrease in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to a decline in sales to the government  which decreased million 
the decrease in government product revenue is attributable to a decline in promina revenue as the networking equipment market continues to move to ip based communications and the number of operational systems deployed in government programs that use our promina systems has declined 
we do not expect revenue from the government sector  or total revenue  to return to the levels of previous years unless and until our newer products achieve broader market acceptance 
several of these products are not scheduled for release until the second half of fiscal until such time  government revenue is likely to remain flat or decrease 
a substantial portion of the revenue generated from our government customers is based on our contract with the gsa  which is currently up for renewal 
as part of the renewal process  the government performed a pre award audit  which identified a number of possible discrepancies regarding our compliance with the current gsa contract 
in response to the pre award audit  we conducted an internal review of our compliance with the contract  which provided an estimate of potential liabilities resulting from the discrepancies 
based on the results of the internal review  we accrued a liability of  and reduced revenue by the same amount  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for an expected restitution payment to the government 
if the gsa contract is renewed by the government  we expect the discount offered to government customers to be higher than it was for most of the term of the current contract 
the decrease in product revenue in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to decreased sales in international commercial markets 
international commercial sales decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the general decline in the market for circuit switched products 
product revenue is generated primarily from our circuit switched product line  promina 
several years ago  we introduced two product lines  shout and scream  aimed at the ip telephony and broadband equipment markets 
we also introduced a new network management system  netms 
product revenue from products other than promina  including shout and scream  was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  or   and of product revenue  respectively 
service and other revenue decreased in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal the reduction in service and other revenue is primarily due to a decline in the installed base of equipment held by non government customers as well as the cancellation in the second quarter of fiscal of a service order that accounted for annual revenue of approximately million 
in addition  a number of customers lowered their levels of service support in efforts to reduce their operating costs  which is enabled in part by the reliability of our promina products 
the decline in service and other revenue in fiscal due to these factors was partially offset by an increase in service revenue from government customers  as a number of these customers contracted directly with us for service rather than using our third party service provider 
the timing of recognition of revenue is also dependent on customer deployment schedules and the timing of contractual acceptance provisions being met  which could cause significant fluctuations in our revenue in the near term 
gross margin year ended march march march product gross margin service and other gross margin total gross margin product and total gross margin decreased in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from service and other gross margin increased in fiscal from fiscal after declining in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in product gross margin in fiscal from fiscal is due to lower product revenue on relatively fixed production overhead costs and the affect of the accrual for the expected restitution payment to the gsa 
the decrease in product gross margin in fiscal from fiscal is due to lower product revenue and a higher mix of shout and scream product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue 
the lower product revenue requires relatively fixed production overhead costs to be spread over less product revenue 
shout and the vx series and scream currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components 
production overhead in fiscal was affected by the transition of manufacturing from our own facility to a contract manufacturer  which we completed in fiscal during this transition  a small portion of manufacturing activity was performed at our fremont facility  such that our production overhead included the costs of activities at both locations until september the most significant of the additional manufacturing costs included in production overhead were fixed costs of the fremont facility of approximately  from april through august beginning in september  these facility costs have been recorded as general and administrative costs as we hold the facility for potential future uses 
the extra week in fiscal resulted in approximately  in additional fixed production overhead costs as compared to the prior years 
we also increased our inventory reserves for potential excess inventory at t he end of fiscal due to the decline in demand for our products in fiscal  which accounted for an additional  in cost of product 
product gross margin can be significantly affected by the mix of products sold  including the extent of third party  or oem  products sold 
we expect our sales of oem products to federal government customers to decline  partly as a result of newly restricted purchasing of open market items on orders issued under our gsa schedule and related contracts 
revenue from oem products  of which the majority have been sold to government customers  including the federal government  was million  million  and million  respectively  in fiscal   and  or   and of product revenue  respectively 
the introduction of new products  which typically have lower gross margins as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components  will affect margins as we transition from our established promina product to newer products 
the increase in service and other gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to decreased costs of our service operations as we aligned our cost structure with current service requirements 
the reductions in costs from realigning our service operations in fiscal were offset by  in additional costs as a result of the additional week in fiscal as compared to the prior years 
the decrease in service and other gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to predominantly fixed costs of providing service  spread over a lower amount of service and other revenue 
a decline in the installed base of our equipment  coupled with the reliability of our promina product  has resulted in a reduction in service contracts and an overall decline in service revenue 
service and other gross margin is affected primarily by the level of service contracts and the mix of service between our commercial and government customers 
our government customers primarily contract service from a third party  but sometimes directly from us 
in the event government customers contract directly with us  we must still incur third party costs to deliver the service  which adversely affects our service margin 
additionally  service gross margin will typically vary over time due to changes in the mix of services  whether fixed cost or time and materials based  for example  and the timing of service contract initiations and renewals 
operating expenses year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructure and other costs total operating expenses total operating expenses decreased or million in fiscal from fiscal  and or million in fiscal from fiscal the decreases are due to cost cutting efforts across all functions as a result of management s intent to realign the business with revenue levels 
the primary changes in operating expenses in fiscal versus fiscal are we reduced non production headcount to approximately employees at march  from at march   which accounted for reductions in compensation and benefits costs totaling million across all functions 
we reduced office space or closed offices in the field reducing non manufacturing facility and rent costs by million 
this reduction was offset by a net increase in general and administrative expenses of  due mainly to the inclusion since september of all expenses  totaling approximately million  related to our former fremont manufacturing facility as we hold the facility for potential future uses 
prior to september  most of these facility costs were recorded as costs of product revenue and expenses of functional areas other than general and administrative 
we also reduced travel and entertainment expenses by  and trade shows and marketing communications expenses by  we benefited from reductions in depreciation of approximately million as capital spending decreased and as more fixed assets became fully depreciated 
restructure and other costs were million less 
these reductions were offset by approximately  in additional costs as a result of the additional week in fiscal the primary changes in operating expenses in fiscal versus fiscal are we reduced non production headcount to employees at march  from at march   which resulted in a decrease of million in compensation and benefits costs across all functions 
these reductions were offset by restructure costs totaling million and third party costs to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act totaling  detail of restructure and other costs is as follows year ended march march march employee separation costs lease write offs  office closure costs  and other expired employee benefits adjustments to previous lease restructure estimates fiscal restructure and other costs in fiscal consisted mainly of million related to the severance agreement executed with our former chief executive officer and other employee separation costs resulting from reductions in the international sales and service organization  as well as other cost cutting efforts across all functions including  for terminating a contract for employee training 
these amounts were offset by reversals of  resulting from expiration of employee benefits accrued for previous restructurings and  related to the sublease of our dallas  texas office necessitating an adjustment to previous lease restructuring estimates 
fiscal restructure and other costs in fiscal included employee separation costs of million and lease write offs and office closure costs of  offset by a benefit of  the employee separation costs resulted from two separate reorganizations of our international sales organization in the first and third quarters of fiscal  the second of which also involved research and development and other areas 
the lease write offs and office closure costs resulted from a consolidation of sales and service offices in virginia and closure of the research and design facility in ottawa  canada 
the benefit of  resulted from  due to expiration of certain employee benefits from previous restructurings and  due to adjustments to our previous lease restructuring estimates 
fiscal restructure and other costs in fiscal consisted of  for a lease write off and fixed assets write offs due to the closure of a sales office in dallas  texas  offset by  in adjustments to previous lease restructuring estimates 
non operating items year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy interest income interest expense gain on sale of federal services business other income expense the increase in interest income in fiscal from fiscal and  is due to improved returns on our short term investments as a result of higher yields 
the increase in interest income in fiscal was also the result of an increase in total cash 
total cash was million at march  compared to million as of march  and million at march  total cash at march  included long term restricted cash of  included in other assets on our balance sheet  related to our fremont  california facility lease and performance guarantees on customer contracts 
interest expense in fiscal  and consisted primarily of the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures 
also included in interest expense in fiscal and is interest related to a million note payable to our landlord for building repairs related to our former headquarters 
the note was entered into in january and was payable in monthly installments over years with interest at 
we repaid this note in full in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal and  we recorded gains on the sale of our federal services business the federal services business of million in each year 
these gains resulted from certain milestones being met as part of the sale of the federal services business to caci  which was completed in fiscal other income expense was comprised of year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy gain loss on foreign exchange realized gain loss on investments gain loss on sales of assets other income expense income tax provision benefit income tax benefit was million in fiscal  of which  related to the reversal of a reserve resulting from the final resolution of a german tax matter  and  related to the reversal of a reserve upon completion of tax inspections in the united kingdom 
income tax benefit was million in fiscal  related to the reversal of a reserve upon completion of tax inspections in the united kingdom 
income tax provision was  in fiscal due to taxes on our international business 
each year  we evaluate the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash balances of million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the balance includes cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the balance includes cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  and long term restricted cash included in other assets on our balance sheet of  related to our fremont  california facility lease and performance guarantees on customer contracts 
net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million and million in fiscal non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million  million and million  respectively  offset by a gain on the sale of our federal services business of million in fiscal and fiscal we expect to continue to incur charges for depreciation and amortization but will not have any future gains from the sale of our federal services business 
the other items that affect our cash flow from operations are changes in our assets and liabilities accounts  including accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
days sales outstanding dso for the quarter ended march  was days as compared to days for the quarter ended march  credit lines we maintain a million line of credit that is available both for cash advances and for standby letters of credit 
the line bears interest at the bank s prime rate for cash advances and at prime minus for letters of credit at march  
the line expires on october  and is secured by our accounts receivable 
the agreement requires immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding if our cash balance  defined as the sum of unrestricted cash and short and long term investments  declines by more than million from the previous quarter or million during the preceding twelve months 
as of march   million in letters of credit were outstanding under the line 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million compared to net cash used in investing activities in fiscal of million and million in fiscal net cash provided by used in investing activities was in each year affected primarily by the difference between purchases of short term investments and proceeds from maturity of such investments 
proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments exceeded purchases of short term investments by million in fiscal the increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments in fiscal resulted from the need for cash to fund current operations and our stock repurchase program 
purchases of short term investments exceeded proceeds from maturities of short term investments by million in fiscal as we invested cash generated from operations 
purchases of short term investments exceeded proceeds from mat urities of short term investments by million in fiscal as we turned short term investments more quickly to maximize returns 
net cash provided by used in investing activities in fiscal  and also included investments in property  plant and equipment of million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we also invested million in license and development costs as a result of a license and development agreement executed in october with a third party technology supplier 
we will pay an additional  to this supplier under this agreement during the next twelve months 
we expect future investments in property  plant and equipment to be slightly larger than the amount invested during fiscal as we anticipate adding additional equipment as part of our product development activities 
in fiscal and  net cash used in invested activities included million in each year in proceeds from the sale of our federal services business  which was completed in fiscal  and we will receive no further cash from this sale 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily due to repurchases of common stock totaling million under our stock repurchase program  offset by million from the issuance of common stock in connection with activity under employee stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and was million and million  respectively  and resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock in connection with activity under employee stock plans  offset in fiscal by million in repayments on our note payable to our landlord  which was repaid in full 
our stock price was at march   at march   and at march  the stock repurchase plan approved in april continues up to twenty four months and allows for an additional million to be repurchased  subject to changes by the board of directors 
proceeds from the issuance o f common stock from activity under employee stock plans are expected to fluctuate in relation to fluctuations in our stock price  although the employee stock purchase plan was suspended indefinitely effective with the december purchase 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands contractual obligations total to to after long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases license and development agreement total contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials  components and services from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
as of march   there were no such material commitments outstanding 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund operations through at least the next twelve months 
we believe the most strategic uses of our cash resources in the near term include strategic investments to gain access to new technologies  acquisitions  and working capital 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosure involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we use foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
market value gains and losses on these hedged contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
at march   our primary net foreign currency exposures were in japanese yen  british pounds  and euros 
the net financial impact of foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in other income 
our policy is to not use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we believe our hedging strategy will not have a significant effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
a adverse change in the foreign currency rates affecting the contracts as of their march  levels would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately  and if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts should increase or decrease by a similar amount 
however  we could have gains or losses in the future if our actual balances differ from the amounts hedged under foreign exchange contracts 
the amount of such gains or losses would depend in part on the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
a portion of our investment portfolio is composed of income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease of from levels at march  and march  indicated the fair value of the portfolio would change by approximately  at both march  and march  at march   the fair value of the short term investments was million compared to million at march  the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  therefore the interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with interest rates 
at march   the fair value of the trading debt securities was approximately million  unchanged from march
