private container programs cronos manages containers pursuant to agreements negotiated directly with corporations  partnerships and private individuals located in europe  the united states and south africa 
the terms of the agreements vary but do not exceed years and take two principal forms 
under the first form of agreement  cronos generally earns compensation equal to gross lease revenue less direct operating expenses less the payment to the managed container programs  computed in accordance with the terms of each individual agreement 
in certain cases  cronos may also earn an incentive fee 
under the second form of agreement  the container owner is entitled to a fixed payment for a specified term 
cronos earns compensation equal to the excess of gross lease revenue less direct operating expenses less the fixed payment to the managed container program 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
owned containers cronos uses cash  bank loans and capital leases to finance the acquisition of equipment for its own fleet 
from time to time  cronos also owns containers on a temporary basis until such time that the containers are sold to the managed container programs 
most containers identified for sale to the managed container programs are purchased new by cronos  and sold to owners of the managed container programs within six months 
this strategy allows cronos more flexibility to negotiate and buy containers strategically  based on market conditions 
in addition  cronos may on occasion own equipment that has been acquired specifically for resale to third parties under equipment trading transactions 
equipment acquired under equipment trading transactions does not enter the cronos managed fleet 
assets that are funded by capital leases are initially reported at the fair value of the asset categorized within container equipment  with an equivalent liability reported as capital lease obligations 
container equipment is depreciated over its expected useful life 
finance charges are reported over the lease term in accordance with the effective interest method and are recorded as interest expense 
financial information about geographic areas the operations of the group are subject to the fluctuations of world economic and political conditions 
such factors may affect the pattern and levels of world trade 
the group believes that the risks associated with leases to non us customers are generally the same as for leases to us customers 
lease revenue is deemed to be earned based on the physical location of the containers while on lease 
almost all of the group s lease revenue is earned on containers used by its customers in global trade routes 
accordingly  the group believes that it does not possess discernible geographic reporting segments 
see additional discussion in operating segments and in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a risk factors an investment in the common shares of the company involves a high degree of risk 
the principal risks that attend the company and its business include the following market for common shares 
the market for the company s outstanding common shares is not liquid 
the company s four largest groups of shareholders control approximately of its outstanding common shares 
for  the average daily trading volume in the company s shares was  political  economic business risks 
the group may be adversely affected by business  economic and political risks which generally are beyond the control of the group and include political instability  fluctuations in world trade demand for leased containers is dependent upon levels of world trade and the supply of containers relative to demand 
future fluctuations in world trade could negatively affect the group s container leasing operations  fluctuations in inflation  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  import and export tariffs and restrictions  restrictions on the movement of capital  terrorist attacks and the risk of terrorist attack  economic conditions in the shipping and other industries  the supply and cost of new containers for example  lease rates can be impacted by the over supply of new containers into the market  fluctuations in supply and demand for containers resulting from  among other things  obsolescence  changes in the methods or economics of a particular mode of transportation or changes in governmental regulations or safety standards  fluctuations in shipping lines fleet mix demand for leased containers is largely dependent on the decision of shipping lines to lease  rather than purchase  containers to supplement their own operating fleets 
any significant changes in the composition of the shipping lines leased and owned container fleets could adversely affect the demand for leased containers  increases in maintenance expenses  taxes  insurance costs  third party fees and other expenses attributable to the operation and the maintenance of the containers that cannot be offset by increased lease revenues from the containers  the risk of uninsured losses with respect to the containers or insured losses for which insurance proceeds are inadequate  and  the effects of strikes  labor disputes and foreign political unrest 
competition 
the container leasing industry is highly competitive 
some of cronos competitors have greater financial resources than cronos and may be more capable of offering lower per diem rates on a larger fleet 
in addition  the barriers to entry for the container leasing industry are relatively low 
if the supply of available equipment increased significantly as a result of new companies entering the industry  demand for cronos equipment could be adversely affected 
requirement for third party capital 
cronos is heavily dependent upon third parties to supply it with the capital required for container acquisitions 
such capital may not be available to the group to enable it to expand its fleet of containers 
defaults by lessees 
a default by a customer may result in lost revenue for past leasing services and additional operating expenses 
the repossession of containers from customers that have defaulted can prove 
table of contents difficult and  when containers are recovered  the group may not be able to re lease the equipment at comparable rates and on favorable lease terms 
residual value of containers 
the majority of containers that are at the end of their useful economic life are sold in the non maritime secondary market for use as temporary or permanent storage facilities 
the proceeds realized on the disposition of such containers depends on a variety of factors including the location of the container at the time of disposition  foreign currency exchange rates  the lease market for marine cargo containers  the cost of new containers  the quantity of used containers being supplied to the secondary market  technological advances in container construction and in techniques of ocean transportation  and developments in world trade 
a reduction in container residual values could adversely affect the long term returns generated by containers resulting in reduced profitability and reduced capital availability 
specialized containers 
specialized containers include refrigerated containers and tanks 
refrigerated containers are subject to inherent risks of mechanical breakdown and technological obsolescence 
tanks  which can be used to transport hazardous materials  include additional risks of environmental and tort liability 
environmental 
countries that are signatories to the montreal protocol on the environment agreed in november to restrict the use of environmentally destructive refrigerants  banning production but not use of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs beginning in january since then  the environmental impact of cfcs has become increasingly prominent 
on january   it became illegal for environmentally destructive refrigerants to be handled  other than for disposal  in most of the countries that are members of the european union 
all of cronos refrigerated containers purchased since june use non cfc refrigerant gas in the operation and insulation of the containers  although a reduced quantity of cfcs are still used in the container manufacturing process 
at december   of the  refrigerated containers that were operated by the group used the cfc refrigerant gas 
all of the containers are currently on lease and the group will dispose of each unit upon its redelivery 
the replacement refrigerant used in the group s new refrigerated containers may also become subject to similar governmental regulations 
in the past  the group has retrofitted certain refrigerated containers with non cfc refrigerants 
cronos has decided not to retrofit any additional containers 
in the unlikely event that any such further retrofitting expenses should be required  they would not be material to the financial position or results of operations of the group 
key personnel 
the senior management team at cronos has significant industry experience 
the continued growth and profitability of the group depends on the ability to retain senior management 
the loss of certain key personnel could have an adverse impact on the future of the business 
the group is subject to other risks in the operation of its business

see the report on form k filed with the sec on january  by the ordinary application  the liquidator seeks a declaration pursuant to section of the uk insolvency act of  as amended the insolvency act  that the respondents were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of the two toemts with the intent to defraud the creditors of the two toemts and or for other fraudulent purposes  by assisting stefan m 
palatin  a former chairman and chief executive officer of the group  in diverting assets from toemt uk to himself  to entities in which he was interested  and or to his associates  otherwise than for proper purposes and otherwise than for full consideration 
by his ordinary application  the liquidator alleges that the respondents knowingly were parties to the carrying on of the business of the two toemts to defraud the creditors of toemt uk by reason of the transfer on or about november   to toemt uk of  ordinary shares of the group in consideration of the contribution of shares in trans ocean limited by toemt uk to the group worth approximately million  which  ordinary shares were then redeemed and or transferred to mr 
palatin and or his nominee for no or no proper consideration  the transfer on or about december   to toemt uk of  preference shares worth approximately million which were then transferred to barton holding limited a company allegedly controlled by palatin for no or no proper consideration  and a loan which the liquidator alleges not to have been repaid  the making of various payments amounting to approximately million between approximately april and february by cnv to third parties  including mr 
palatin or entities in which he was interested and or his associates  which payments were made otherwise than for any legitimate commercial purpose or any other purpose of toemt uk s business or interests  the making of improper cash withdrawals amounting to in excess of million  between approximately february and june from toemt uk s bank accounts  with the assistance of cnv  which withdrawals were allegedly for the benefit of mr 
palatin and or his wife rather than for any legitimate commercial purpose or other purpose of toemt uk s business or interests  and  the diversion between and with the assistance of cnv of toemt uk s container business to toemt isle of man  for no or for no proper consideration 
the liquidator further seeks a declaration pursuant to section of the insolvency act that the respondents and each of them is liable to contribute to the assets of toemt uk the amount of the deficiency as regards the creditors of toemt uk  which the liquidator currently estimates to be at least million  or  alternatively  that the respondents make such contributions to the assets of toemt uk as the court thinks fit 
the liquidator seeks an order from the court that the respondents and each of them pay to the liquidator any sums found to be due to him by reason of the conduct alleged above  plus interest and costs 
on may   the respondents filed their application the strike out application or application with the court to set aside the court s order granting the liquidator permission to serve his ordinary 
table of contents application on the respondents and  alternatively  for an order granting the respondents summary judgment against the liquidator on his claims 
by their application the respondents asserted that the liquidator s complaint  and the evidence he submitted in support thereof  provided no reasonable grounds for bringing the lawsuit and or that the liquidator has no real prospect of succeeding on his lawsuit and therefore no reason to proceed to trial of his claims against the respondents 
a hearing on the respondents strike out application was heard between july and   at the conclusion of which the court struck out from the liquidator s application his claim of diversion of toemt uk s container business to toemt isle of man claim no 
above  but otherwise set over the hearing until october   pending the liquidator s filing of a comprehensive specification of his claims against the respondents 
the hearing on the respondents strike out application continued on october through  on november   the court rendered its judgment  granting the respondents application as to claim nos 
and above  but denying the respondents application as to claims nos 
and in addition  the court allowed the liquidator to restate his claim no 
to allege that the respondents knowingly participated in mr 
palatin s concealment of his fraudulent diversion of assets from toemt uk 
with respect to the liquidator s claim nos 
and  the court denied the respondents application on the grounds that the liquidator had presented an arguable case and should be allowed to proceed to trial on these claims 
because cay had not been in existence prior to march  the date of the commencement of the toemt uk liquidation proceedings  the court dismissed the liquidator s claims in their entirety against cay 
on november   the liquidator applied to the court to file a new and superseding ordinary application against the respondents to restate claim nos 
  and above and to add three additional instances of alleged knowing participation by the respondents in toemt uk s fraudulent trading 
the three instances involve the sale of approximately refrigerated containers to cnv or an affiliate of the company in may and december of and june of for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the liquidator alleges that the consideration for the containers was not paid or  alternatively  if paid  that the payments were misappropriated from toemt uk by mr 
palatin 
at the hearing held on november  in which the court rendered its judgment on the respondents strike out application  the court awarded the liquidator reimbursement of one half of his costs for the hearing on respondents application estimated to be ninety thousand british pounds  denied the application of the company and cnv the remaining respondents for leave to appeal the court s judgment  and granted the liquidator leave to file his new and superseding ordinary application against the remaining respondents 
the liquidator filed his new and superceding ordinary application against the remaining respondents on february  on november   the remaining respondents filed their notice with the court of appeal seeking leave to appeal that portion of the court s judgment denying their strike out application  on the ground that the court s ruling on the claims it did not strike out is incorrect as a matter of law 
with respect to the liquidator s three additional instances of alleged knowing participation by the remaining respondents in toemt uk s fraudulent trading  the remaining respondents believe the allegations to be without merit and time barred 
on march   the court of appeal granted in part and denied in part the remaining respondents application to appeal the court s judgment

the limit of the guarantee is million 
the guarantee shall remain open until the liquidation proceedings of the two toemts are completed and the two toemts are struck off the uk and isle of man companies registers 
with the purchase of the claims of the only known creditors of both toemts  the company intends to pursue an end to the litigation brought by the toemt liquidator against the respondents

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the group s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the segment information presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements relates to the containers in the group s fleet owned by the group itself owned containers and by managed container programs 
owned containers include containers held for resale 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as a single fleet 
the group has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the group s agreements with the owners of managed container programs meet the definition of leases within the scope of sfas no 
accounting for leases sfas  they are accounted for in the group s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the group is lessee 
in  of payments to owners of managed container programs represented agreements which generally provided that the amounts payable to container owners were based upon the rentals to ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and the compensation earned by cronos for managing the equipment 
the remaining of payments to managed container programs represented agreements under which there were fixed payment terms 
minimum lease payments on the agreements with fixed payment terms are included in item under contractual obligations and in note c to the group s consolidated financial statements 
overview of primary revenue and expense items gross lease revenue is generated by leasing containers  both owned by the group and by managed container programs  to ocean carriers under operating leases and exclude billings in advance 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the group at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally billed and payable on a monthly basis 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon changes in fleet size  utilization rates and per diem rates 
equipment trading revenue and expenses represent revenue earned from the sale of equipment and the cost of the equipment sold 
in equipment trading transactions  the group enters into an agreement in which it undertakes to supply equipment to a third party 
simultaneously  cronos enters into a separate agreement with a container manufacturer for the acquisition of the equipment 
the group acts as principal in such transactions and accordingly the revenue and expenses are reported gross 
this equipment does not enter the cronos fleet of managed containers 
commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the group s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases  fees earned in connection with equipment consultancy and design services  licence fee income earned in connection with the patented cpcs see item business  fees earned on the disposal of containers owned by managed container programs  foreign exchange gains or losses  and miscellaneous other fees and income 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are recognized in the statement of income on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
this item is affected by the size of managed programs and the contracted acquisition fee  the quantity of consultancy and design projects undertaken and the profit margins earned in each transaction  the quantity of cpcs acquired by third parties  the quantity and value of direct financing leases  the proceeds realized on the 
table of contents disposition of used containers and the fee earned in each case and changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other major currencies 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing both owned and managed containers 
management analyzes direct operating expenses as a percentage of gross lease revenue 
direct operating expenses may be categorized as follows activity related expenses include agents costs and depot costs  such as repairs  maintenance and handling  inventory related expenses relate to off hire containers and comprise storage and repositioning costs 
these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered  legal and other expenses include legal costs related to the recovery of containers  insurance and provisions for doubtful accounts 
payments to managed container programs reflect the amounts due to the owners of containers in managed container programs computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  all professional fees  including audit  legal and other professional fees  business insurance and information technology costs 
segment profit or loss for reported segments  comprises items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the group s operating segments  including gross lease revenue  direct operating expenses  payments to managed container programs  direct financing lease income  container interest expense  container depreciation expense and certain impairment charges 

table of contents funding the ability of the group to add new equipment to both its owned and managed fleets was one of the main reasons for the growth in profitability in recent years 
cronos recognizes that its ability to secure funding from third parties in order to expand its container fleet is crucial to its future growth and profitability 
traditionally  cronos has utilized funding from each of its operating segments to expand its container fleet 
in more recent years  the majority of the growth has been generated by the owned container segment  through debt and capital leases  and by the joint venture program 
each of these sources provides a flexible financing structure with competitive pricing 
restructure of funding sources 
on august   the group completed the first phase of a funding restructuring program 
this involved a series of transactions that were closed in june and august of the key features of this program to date are on june   as reported by the group in its report on form k of the same date the maximum debt commitment available to the joint venture program increased from million to million 
on august   as reported by the group in its report on form k of the same date the group increased its aggregate equity contribution commitment to the joint venture program from million to million  the group sold million of equipment that had been financed in its revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility to the joint venture program 
this equipment was sold at book value  which approximated fair value  and accordingly no gain or loss arose on the sale  the group utilized part of the proceeds from the sale to fund an equity contribution of million to the joint venture program to finance the fixed asset acquisition  the group repaid a debt facility with a then outstanding balance of million  the group repaid million of revolving credit facility debt reducing the balance outstanding to million on august   the maximum debt commitment available under the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million  and  the interest rate on the revolving credit facility declined by basis points 
the ultimate objective of the funding restructuring program is to securitize the indebtedness of the joint venture program in this should result in a further reduction in the cost of funding and allow the group to be more competitive when bidding for leasing transactions 
the sale of the container assets to the joint venture program will assist it to achieve the minimum level of indebtedness required for a securitization within the target timeframe and has generated sufficient cash to allow cronos to fund the increased equity contributions required from the group for the expansion of the joint venture program 
the group will earn a fee for managing the equipment sold to the joint venture program and is entitled to of the net income generated by the equipment sold 
in the long term  the securitization of the indebtedness of the joint venture program should result in increased growth and profitability for cronos 
while the group expects the indebtedness of the joint venture program to be securitized in  there can be no assurance that its debt can be securitized or that the expected interest cost savings will materialize 

table of contents funding for owned containers 
the primary debt facilities include financial covenants tested on a quarterly basis including minimum tangible net worth  the maximum level of debt and capital lease obligations to tangible net worth and interest expense coverage 
at december   the group was in compliance with these covenants 
the breach of a covenant constitutes an event of default 
at december   the group had million of available container borrowing facilities under which million was outstanding 
in addition  the group had million of short term credit facilities under which million was outstanding 
the short term credit facilities are available  if required  for operating activities 
the primary source of debt funding available to the group is its revolving credit facility 
as discussed herein  on august   the revolving credit facility was amended to reduce the commitment of the lenders from million to million 
under the terms of the amended facility the revolving credit period was extended until july   and unless the revolving credit period is extended on that date  the balance outstanding as of july   will be repaid over three years 
the interest rate under the amended facility declined to one month london inter bank offered rate libor plus basis points from one month libor plus basis points 
the amendment to the facility removed the requirement to hold a minimum restricted cash balance and as a result the level of restricted cash balances related to debt facilities declined by million since the beginning of the group utilizes the revolving credit facility to fund the acquisition of new equipment and to refinance existing debt and capital lease facilities 
new equipment is funded by debt and by cash provided by the group 
the group usually makes monthly repayments under the revolving credit facility and  from time to time  may sell equipment that has been financed by the facility to managed container programs 
any such reductions to the facility may be redrawn to fund the acquisition of additional equipment subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to the maintenance of minimum collateral levels 
it is anticipated that the balance of funds available under the revolving credit facility will be utilized primarily to purchase new equipment 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million 
an additional amount of million was available for immediate drawdown against the collateral provided by the group under the facility 
the ability of the group to expand its owned container fleet may be constrained if the revolving credit period is not renewed on a periodic basis or if the group cannot provide the cash required for new container acquisitions 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  the group finances the acquisition of equipment with term debt and capital lease facilities 
in  the group secured million of funding under such facilities representing an increase of million when compared to the group enters into annual discussions with lenders in order to renew the amounts available under existing facilities and to add new facilities 
the group expects that the amount of funding provided by these lenders in will approximate the level raised in joint venture program 
the joint venture program has been a major source of funding for the group since its inception in at december  the joint venture program had capacity for an additional million of new equipment 
as discussed herein  the lenders to the joint venture program increased their maximum debt commitment from million to million on june  under the amended facility  there will be a one year revolving line of credit which will be renewed annually 
the first renewal date will be june  and  if the facility is not renewed  the debt balance outstanding on that date will be repaid over a period of ten years with the repayments equalling per annum of the outstanding balance 
the future growth of the joint venture program may be constrained if the revolving line of credit is not renewed on an annual basis  if increases in equity and debt funding are not approved when required or if the 
table of contents group cannot provide the cash required for its equity contribution 
see further discussion in material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations herein 
at december   the joint venture program had fixed assets and direct financing leases with a book value of million  partly funded by debt of million 
in the twelve months ended december  the group earned million as compensation for the management of containers owned by the program  recorded million in equity in earnings of the program and contributed million of capital to the joint venture program 
private container programs 
the growth experienced in global container trade in recent years has attracted capital to this segment 
private container programs acquired over million of new container equipment in see further discussion in material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations herein 
us limited partnership programs 
the objectives of the partnerships are to invest in marine cargo containers  to generate continuing income for distribution to the limited partners  and to realize the residual value of the container equipment at the end of its useful economic life or upon the liquidation of a partnership 
at december   the us limited partnership programs had total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
on july   the offering period for the latest us limited partnership program program closed 
this program raised million of proceeds and acquired million of new container equipment since its inception in the group organized a new program on september  this program is designed to raise a maximum of million of proceeds  in an offering conducted pursuant to regulation d of the securities and exchange commission  from accredited limited partners and may also seek to augment the size of its container investments by borrowing under loan facilities secured from commercial lenders

table of contents market overview average utilization for the combined cronos fleet was in compared to in the prior year 
utilization at december  declined by from the beginning of the year 
approximately of this decline was due to the addition of new container equipment that had not yet been placed on lease 
the following table summarizes the combined utilization of the cronos fleet utilization at december average utilization during the year the following table summarizes the composition of the total fleet at december   by reportable segment  based on original equipment cost 
us limited joint private partnership venture container owned total programs program programs containers fleet dry cargo containers specialized containers refrigerated containers tank containers dry freight specials total cronos operates a highly diversified fleet of dry cargo and specialized containers 
cronos believes that a diversified fleet produces higher profit  more growth opportunities  a wider customer base and allows it to broaden its business base with its existing customers by supplying a wide range of their equipment requirements 
in addition  demand for certain of these containers is less likely to be affected by global economic downturns due to the nature of their markets and customer base 
the lease market for dry cargo containers is sensitive to the demand for consumer goods and the levels of investment by shipping lines as they procure dry cargo containers for their own fleet 
during  the demand for leased dry cargo containers moderated from the levels in when demand often exceeded supply 
in the first half of  container manufacturers reported that the total level of new dry cargo container inventories in china exceeded market requirements 
cronos believes that this imbalance was due  in part  to the fact that shipping lines were more successful at moving their own container equipment into demand locations in than in  allowing them to manage their container inventories more efficiently  and also due to an easing in the level of port congestion that was reported in the united states and europe in manufacturers currently report that leasing company inventories of new dry cargo containers have returned to normal levels 
the excessive inventories reduced requirements for new dry cargo container production in and placed downward pressure on new dry cargo container prices and the related lease rates 
in addition  steel prices declined during the year 
the price for a new twenty foot dry cargo container declined to  in early from  early in cronos experienced strong growth in specialized containers in  purchasing a total of million of refrigerated  tank and dry freight special equipment 
refrigerated containers  representing the biggest category of specialized containers  were the fastest growing equipment type in the cronos fleet in  representing million of new production 
the demand for containerized food cargos  such as frozen fish  frozen meat and fresh fruit  continues to grow 
in addition  the conversion of food cargos from non containerized break bulk shipping methods to refrigerated containers is also contributing to the increasing demand for refrigerated containers by cronos customers 
cronos expects these trends to continue in future years 

table of contents tank containers also represent a significant share of the specialized container fleet  with their growth driven by the demand for chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food products 
in  cronos invested million in tank containers 
the demand for tank containers is strong due to increased volumes of transported bulk liquid and also changing trends in the method of transportation for bulk liquids from drums to tank containers 
tank containers offer users greater safety  reduced cargo damage and increased economies of scale 
the size of the cronos tank fleet has doubled in the last three years 
the market for dry freight specials has been buoyed by the increase in investment in heavy equipment and project cargo  as well as an increase in investment by car carriers in the form of roll on roll off ships 
cronos acquired million of new dry freight special equipment in cronos expects the demand for specialized containers to increase even further in based on the following market observations increasing demand for transportation of food products such as frozen fish  frozen meat and fresh fruit  increasing demand for tank containers as a result of growth in the volume of bulk liquid transportation within the chemical  pharmaceutical and food industries  increasing levels of conversion of cargo from non containerized to containerized transportation in both the refrigerated and tank container markets  and  increasing levels of investment in heavy equipment and project cargo  particularly in asia  as well as increased investment in car carriers by major car transportation shipping lines 
cronos has set increased investment targets for specialized containers in in line with its growth and profit expectations for these products 
cronos expects that the leasing market for dry cargo containers will slow further in based on the following market observations shipping lines are experiencing increased pressure on operating margins due to increased fuel prices and lower freight rates 
as new container ships continue to be added to the world s fleet  the pressure on operating margins will continue as shipping lines are forced to lower their freight rates in order to utilize their increased capacity  the growth in demand for consumer goods in the united states  europe and other developed economies has slowed  and most forecasts are uncertain as to when this trend will reverse  and  recent mergers among major shipping lines will most likely result in further fleet consolidations  allowing shipping lines to operate more efficiently in certain locations and trade routes 
this will have a further dampening effect on the demand for leased containers 
in  cronos experienced a strong market for used container sales 
used containers are typically sold in the non maritime secondary market for use as temporary or permanent storage facilities 
the group sold approximately  containers from the owned and managed fleets in resulting in a profit of million on the disposition of cronos owned containers 
cronos believes that the decline in new container prices and the increase in container inventories at non factory locations will reduce the sales price of used containers 
cronos has increased its disposal targets for and will dispose of off hire inventories in locations where sales prices equal or exceed internal economic targets

the fleets of both the private container programs and the us limited partnership programs have declined as the quantities of equipment disposed at the end of its useful economic life exceeded new container additions 
at december   the owned container fleet included approximately  teu of equipment that was held for resale to managed container programs 
excluding equipment held for resale  the owned container fleet declined by as a result of the sale to the joint venture program

the impact of these charges was partially offset by the following income of million recognized on the recovery of amounts owed by a related party  the recovery of million payable to a private container program  and  the reversal of a taxation provision of million which had been provided against potential withholding taxes on the unremitted retained earnings of certain subsidiaries 
the overall effect of these items was to reduce net income by million  or approximately cents per diluted share 
analysis discussion gross lease revenue glr of million for the year ended december   was million  or  higher than for the prior year 
of the increase  million was due to the increase in fleet size and million was due to the effect of the increased utilization during the year 
glr increased for almost all product types  with the exception of refrigerated containers where glr declined by million due to the disposal of older equipment at the end of its economic life 
direct operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to due primarily to reductions in inventory related and activity related costs repositioning expense declined by million as the group moved fewer containers from low to high demand locations reflecting the low volume of off hire inventories and the strong market for container disposals  and  activity related expenses declined by million as the level of handling and repair work undertaken decreased in line with the reduced volumes of container redeliveries and off hire inventories

container interest expense of million in was million higher than in the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to increased us interest rates 
in addition  the group incurred million of breakage costs that resulted from the restructure of the revolving credit facility 
the increase in interest was partially offset by the effect of the repayment of million of debt utilizing part of the proceeds generated by the container fixed asset sale to the joint venture program

commissions  fees and other operating income of million in was million higher than the prior year 
the main changes were attributable to an increase of million in the level of gains recorded on the disposal of fixed assets 
this was due in part to the increased disposal proceeds realized on the sale of equipment at the end of its economic life see discussion in market overview above  a million increase in design and consultancy fee income reflecting a project undertaken with a european customer  a million increase in fees earned on the disposal of containers owned by managed container programs that again reflected the strong market for used containers  and  a million increase in finance lease income due to an increase in the value of direct financing leases held by the group 
gain on settlement of litigation in january  the group completed the sale of an estate located in amersham  england the amersham estate in which stefan m 
palatin  a former chairman of the group  held a beneficial interest 
the order for the sale of the amersham estate had been directed by the uk courts so that the proceeds of the sale could be applied to discharge two charging orders that the group had secured against mr 
palatin and his beneficial interest in the amersham estate 
the group received a total of million in respect of the two charging orders and related interest 
the first charging order secured by cronos was in respect of the remaining principal balance of million owed under a loan note by mr 
palatin and related interest of million 
the second charging order was secured in respect of an additional amount of million owed by mr 
palatin and related interest of million 
in december  the group conducted a review of the million proceeds expected on the sale of the amersham estate 
the group concluded that the loan note subject to the first charging order was recoverable and accordingly  the million reserve that had previously been recorded against the principal balance of the loan note in was reversed and the receivable reinstated in december the remaining proceeds of million expected on the sale of the amersham estate  comprised the second charging order and interest due in connection with the first and second charging orders 
a receivable had not previously been recorded for these items 
the group concluded that as these items represented contingent gains  they should not be recognized until the consummation of the sale of the amersham estate and the settlement of all contingencies requisite to the distribution of funds to the group 
accordingly  the million of additional proceeds were recognized in the first quarter of on the completion of the sale of the property and the distribution of the amounts due to cronos under the charging orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  when compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in legal costs for toemt and palatin litigation  and  million of charges in respect of one time termination benefits relating to involuntary employee terminations pursuant to reorganizations of the marketing and operations structures 
these increases were partly offset by a million decline in the expense recognized for a stock appreciation rights plan reflecting a smaller increase in the group share price in than in recovery of amount payable to a managed container program in the group entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with a group of austrian investment entities collectively known as contrin 

table of contents the settlement agreement provided for cronos to pay contrin a total of million if the group was unable to foreclose the charging orders against the amersham estate by the third anniversary of the effective date of the settlement december  
in addition  had the net proceeds of foreclosure of the amersham estate in satisfaction of the charging orders and any charging order obtained by the group to enforce an austrian judgment totalled less than million  then the group agreed to make up the difference 
in  the company calculated that the present value of the total million future cash payments under the settlement agreement installment payment plan  discounted using an appropriate risk free interest rate  was million 
in addition  the group had previously recorded a reserve of approximately million against the contrin claims 
interest has been charged to the company s income statement over the period for performance of the settlement agreement using the effective interest rate method 
under the settlement agreement installment payment plan  cronos paid contrin million in november and million in february cronos made an additional payment of million on the completion of the sale of the amersham estate and the distribution to cronos of the amounts due to cronos under the two charging orders in the first quarter of the balance of million was originally due on or before november  in the first quarter of  the group  contrin  and the toemt liquidator settled their differences with respect to the allocation of the proceeds remaining from the sale of the amersham estate after discharging the cronos charging orders the amersham surplus proceeds  agreeing to an allocation of such proceeds between contrin and the liquidator 
this agreement was approved by the court supervising the toemt liquidation in april under the agreement  contrin was allocated amersham surplus proceeds in an amount sufficient to fully discharge the group s remaining payment obligations to contrin under the terms of settlement agreement 
in march  the total payable to contrin in the cronos financial statements of million  comprising the balance of the reserve of million and interest accrued since the date of the settlement agreement of million was recognized as income 
provision for legal claims as discussed in item legal proceedings  the liquidator acting on behalf of the two toemt companies has made a number of claims against cronos 
the group understands that the liquidator has identified two creditors mkb and the contrin creditors of the toemt companies and to date has acknowledged the claims of mkb 
mkb bases its claim against the toemt companies on one or more loan notes the loan notes purportedly issued by the toemt companies 
in december  the group entered into an agreement the agreement with an independent third party the third party under which it contracted to pay a maximum amount of million inclusive of related transaction costs to the third party to acquire the loan notes  in the event that the third party were to purchase the loan notes from mkb

recovery of related party loan note of million in represented the reversal of a provision against the principal balance due under a loan note between the group and mr 
palatin 
the group had previously established a reserve against the principal balance of million in in december  the group entered into a contract for the sale of the amersham estate 
the order for sale of the amersham estate had been directed by the uk courts so that the proceeds of the sale could be applied to discharge two charging orders that the group had secured against mr 
palatin and his beneficial interest in the amersham estate 
the first charging order secured by cronos was in respect of the remaining balance  and related interest  owed under the loan note by mr 
palatin 
the second charging order was secured in respect of additional amounts owed by mr 
palatin for which the group had not recorded a receivable 
in december  the group conducted a review of the amount due under the loan note and concluded  that in light of the fact that a 
table of contents contract for the sale of the amersham estate had been executed and that no other creditor of mr 
palatin had secured an equal or better charge over the proceeds from the amersham estate  that the loan note was recoverable 
accordingly  the million provision that had previously been recorded against the principal balance of the loan note was reversed and the receivable reinstated 
the group also conducted a review of additional proceeds of million expected on the sale of the amersham estate  comprising the second charging order and interest due in connection with the first and second charging orders 
a receivable had not previously been recorded for these items 
the group concluded that as these items represented contingent gains  they should not be recognized until the consummation of the sale of the amersham estate and the settlement of all contingencies requisite to the distribution of funds to the group 
the sale of the amersham estate was completed in january  and the group received million in respect of its charging orders and related interest

the effective tax rate after adjusting for the non operating recovery of the related party loan note was 
in  the tax benefit of million included tax charges of million which were more than offset by a credit of million that was recorded in connection with an asset refinancing transaction 
the million reduction in the amount of tax charges in was due primarily to the fact that the increased profit reported in has been earned in jurisdictions with relatively low tax rates 
in addition  the group recorded a million tax benefit in one of its european entities that arose as a result of transactions involving the transfer of container equipment 
liquidity and capital resources the group uses cash from a number of sources in order to meet its operating and other cash flow commitments 
the primary sources of cash generated by operating activities are gross lease revenue provided by the group s container fleet  fee revenues from its managed container programs and other parties and income earned on equipment trading and direct financing lease transactions 
cash flow is utilized to meet costs relating to day to day fleet support  payments to managed container programs  selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  servicing the current portion of long term borrowings  financing a portion of owned container acquisitions  providing equity contributions to fund of the capital expenditure requirements of the joint venture program and making payments to container manufacturers on equipment trading transactions 
cash flows relating to gross lease revenue are largely dependent upon the timely collections of lease revenues from shipping lines and other customers 
at december   the amount due from lessees was million representing an increase of million from the position at december  this increase is entirely due to the increase in the amounts billed for gross lease revenue and disposal proceeds in based on loss experience for the last fourteen years  bad debts have approximated of lease revenues 
the group monitors the aging of lease receivables  collections and the credit status of existing and potential customers 
there is always a risk that some shipping lines may experience financial difficulty 
any resultant material increase in the level of bad debts could potentially affect the ability of the group to meet its operating and other commitments 
the group utilizes the proceeds arising from the transfer of equipment held for resale to managed container programs to pay the related amount due to container manufacturers 
at december   the group held million of container equipment for resale to managed container programs  including the joint venture program 
this represented a million increase over the position at december   and 
table of contents was due to the increase in the level of container acquisitions by the group due to the strong demand for specialized containers and the continued growth of the joint venture program 
proceeds generated by the sale of owned containers at the end of their economic life are utilized in the first instance to repay any related outstanding balance under debt or capital lease facilities 
the group utilizes surplus cash balances to pre pay debt under the revolving credit facility and thereby reduces interest expense 
such amounts may be redrawn at a later date for the purchase of containers and other purposes 
cash flow statements for the years ended december   and operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during was million 
cash collections increased by million when compared to due to the combined effect of the increase in the amounts billed and collected for gross lease revenue and container disposals 
a significant portion of the increased cash collections were in turn utilized to make the related payments to managed container programs 
during  the group sold million of container equipment  which had been held for resale  to managed container programs 
the proceeds from these sales have been used to make the related payments to the container manufacturer 
other receipts in included million relating to the distribution of proceeds from the sale of the amersham estate 
the net cash provided by operating activities in was million  or  lower than in the decline in the net cash generated in was primarily due to the following a million increase in payments for selling general and administrative payments including legal costs incurred for palatin and toemt litigation  and  the cash generated by operating activities in included additional receipts totaling almost million related to payments received for an equipment trading transaction and the release of cash that had previously been held as a security deposit 
net cash provided by operating activities during was higher than in the increase in net cash generated in was primarily due to the following increased collections of gross lease revenue  reduced payments for direct operating costs  and  increased receipts for equipment trading transactions 
these were partially offset by increased distributions to managed container programs  and  increased payments for selling  general and administrative expenses 
investing activities include the acquisition of containers for the group s owned container fleet  the purchase of other assets related to the operation of the worldwide cronos office network and equity investments in the joint venture program 
net cash provided by investing activities for was million and included the following the receipt of proceeds realized on the disposal of equipment amounting to million 
of this  million related to the sale of equipment to the joint venture program  and the balance related to equipment sold at the end of its useful life

table of contents material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations joint venture program 
the joint venture program has been a major source of managed container program funding since its inception in and is owned by a subsidiary of the group and owned by a lender to the group  a major international financial services provider 
the purpose of the program is to acquire and lease marine cargo containers to third party lessees with several lenders  including the joint venture owner  providing up to of the cost of acquiring the containers and the joint venture partners each providing one half of the equity to fund the balance of the capital requirements of the program 
the joint venture entity is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose company organized under the laws of bermuda 
the group has determined that the joint venture program falls within the scope of fin r  however it is not a variable interest entity 
the maximum exposure for cronos to losses as a result of its involvement with the joint venture program at december   was million  representing the total of its equity investment in the joint venture program and the management fees due to cronos from the program 
the joint venture program is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the operative documents governing the joint venture program  certain changes in control of the group constitute an event of default  permitting the lenders to the joint venture program to accelerate repayment of the joint venture program s indebtedness 
in addition  whether or not a change of control constitutes an event of default  one of the agreements governing the joint venture program provides that upon a change in control of the group  the parent of the group s joint venture partner and lead lender to the joint venture program may cause the group to purchase the container assets of the joint venture program at a purchase price equal to their book value plus a premium of  and to purchase all other assets of the joint venture program at their book value

us limited partnership programs general partner 
the group has equity interests as a general partner in six us limited partnership programs 
the partnerships are all california limited partnerships managed by cronos capital corp  an indirect subsidiary of the company 
since  sixteen public limited partnerships and one private limited partnership have raised over million from over  investors 
eleven of the original seventeen partnerships have now been dissolved 
the general partner investments are accounted for using the equity method 
in accordance with fin r  the company has determined that the six limited partnerships qualify as variable interest entities 
in each case  the company has concluded that neither the company  nor any of its subsidiaries  is the primary beneficiary of any us limited partnership program 
the general partner is indemnified by the partnerships for any liabilities suffered by it arising out of its activities as general partner  except in the case of misconduct or negligence 
as limited partnerships  the limited partners may not be assessed for additional capital contributions  and it is possible that the general partner could be liable if the assets of the partnerships are not sufficient to pay their liabilities 
however  the group considers that the risk of any such loss is not material 
therefore  the maximum exposure for cronos to losses as a result of its involvement with the us limited partnership programs at december   was million  representing the total amount due to cronos for management fees and other items from the partnerships

table of contents parent guarantee under agreements with private container programs 
the company has provided parent guarantees for certain agreements between wholly owned subsidiaries of the company and private container programs 
the agreements are in the form of a master lease and provide that the subsidiary companies make payments to the private container programs based on rentals collected after deducting direct operating expenses and the income earned by the subsidiary company for managing the containers 
the subsidiary company is not liable to make payments to the private container program if the containers are not placed on a lease or if a lessee fails to pay the lease rentals 
at each financial statement date  the amounts due under each agreement are recorded as a liability and disclosed under amounts payable to managed container programs 
the amount payable at december  was million 
the terms of the guarantees generally obligate the company to ensure payments and other obligations of the subsidiary companies are performed on a timely basis and in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the agreements with the private container programs expire between and should a default occur  the company would be required to make the contracted payments on behalf of the subsidiary companies over the remaining term of the agreements or until such time as the default was remedied 
based on the million earned by the private container programs for the fourth quarter of  the company estimates that the maximum amount of future payments for rentals collected after deducting direct operating expenses and the income earned for managing the containers would be million 
the fair value of the estimated amount of maximum future payments is million 
guarantees under fixed non cancellable operating leases with private container programs 
certain subsidiaries of the group have fixed operating lease agreements for container equipment with private container programs 
the company has provided parent company guarantees for the million of minimum future lease payments outstanding under these agreements at december  the agreements provide that  in the event of a default by the subsidiary  the company will pay all amounts due under the agreements as they fall due 
the agreements contain purchase options  the majority of which allow the group to acquire the containers after a period of ten years 
see contractual obligations herein and note c to the consolidated financial statements for the minimum amount of future lease payments due under fixed operating and other lease contracts 
agreements with private container programs early termination options 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the agreements with private container programs contained early termination options  under which the container owner may terminate the agreement if certain performance thresholds are not achieved 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the containers subject to these agreements were eligible for early termination 
cronos believes that early termination of these agreements is unlikely 
agreements with private container programs change of control provisions 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of the containers subject to agreements with private container programs provided that a change in ownership of the group  without the prior consent of the container owner  may constitute an event of default under the agreement 
in substantially all of these agreements  the consent of the container owners may not be unreasonably withheld 
in the event that consent is not obtained  the container owners may require the group to transfer possession of of the containers under management to another equipment manager 
such transfer of possession may result in the group incurring certain costs 
the owners of the remaining of the containers under management may require the group to purchase the equipment from the container owners pursuant to the terms of their respective agreements  generally a stipulated percentage determined by age of the equipment of the original cost of the equipment

primary beneficiary 
in december  the group determined that it was the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in which it held a share 
the group had sold million of containers to the variable interest entity in a series of transactions in prior years 
the variable interests of the group in the entity comprised a management fee that the group earned in return for managing the containers of the entity  a non interest bearing loan note and an option to acquire of the container owning company for one us dollar  the exercise of which was subject to the repayment of certain of the indebtedness of the variable interest entity

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties 
management believes the following are the group s most critical accounting policies 
container equipment depreciable lives 
container equipment is carried at cost  adjusted for impairment  if appropriate  less accumulated depreciation 
containers  both owned by the group and acquired under capital leases  are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows refrigerated container equipment over years to a residual value of tanks  rolltrailers and flat racks over years to a residual value of dry cargo and all other container equipment over years to a residual value of on october   the group changed the straight line depreciation basis for tanks  rolltrailers and flat racks from a useful life of years with a residual value to a useful life of years with a residual value of 
this was in recognition of research conducted by the group which supported the change by providing additional information about the estimated future useful lives and future benefits of the assets 
as a result of the change  net income for the three month period ended december  increased by approximately million and each of basic net income and diluted net income increased by two cents per share 
container equipment valuation 
the group reviews owned container equipment when changes in circumstances require consideration as to whether the carrying value of the equipment has become impaired  pursuant to guidance established in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations undiscounted and without interest charges 
when impairment is deemed to exist  the assets are written down to fair value or to the projected discounted cash flows from related operations 
the group evaluates future cash flows and potential impairment of its fleet by container type rather than for each individual container 
therefore  future losses could result for individual container disposals due to various factors including age  condition  suitability for continued leasing  as well as geographic location of the containers when disposed 
deferred taxation 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the group is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of a deferred tax asset is unlikely 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or the amount of  any valuation allowance 
based on the recent history of operating losses in its us subsidiaries  the near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  the group has maintained a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards in the us since as of december   the group s valuation allowance aggregated million 
in the event the group were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  a reversal of part or all of the valuation allowance would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
cronos continually tracks its credit exposure to each customer using specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by local staff to assess credit quality 
cronos credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions to be taken in order to minimize credit risks 
over the last years  bad debts have approximated of gross lease revenues 
based on this information  cronos has calculated an allowance for doubtful accounts comprising specific amounts provided against known probable losses on certain customers plus an additional amount based on loss experience for other customers 
however  the group may be subject to unexpected loss in rental revenue from container lessees that default under their container lease agreements 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill must be tested at least annually for impairment 
the annual impairment test uses cash flow discounting techniques to determine the fair value of respective reporting units which are then compared to the carrying value of the asset 
management discounts the projected future net cash flows to 
table of contents be generated by the reporting units based on historic and projected trends for per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected remaining life of the unit 
although the projected trends are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values  cash collections and interest rates 
as of december  and  the group determined the carrying value of all its goodwill and indefinite lived assets had not been impaired 
gross lease revenue managed container programs 
cronos leases equipment to ocean carriers that is owned by its managed container programs 
cronos acts as principal in the lease arrangement with shipping lines based on the characteristics of these transactions in which cronos determines the ocean carrier to which the equipment is leased  sets the applicable lease rental rate  acts as primary obligor in the transaction and collects the lease rentals 
accordingly  cronos reports the resulting lease income on a gross basis  rather than net of its lease costs to the managed container programs 
us limited partnership programs fin r 
the group has determined that the us limited partnership programs are variable interest entities as defined in fin r 
cronos has performed an analysis of the expected losses and the expected residual returns of the us limited partnership programs and determined that the group is not the primary beneficiary of these programs 
although the assumptions used in the calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgment for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values and cash collections 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas revised share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments

sfas r is effective for the first annual period beginning after december  management does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the group 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change  the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  in june  fasb ratified the consensus reached in the emerging issues task force issue no

table of contents partnership or a similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited partners 
the consensus also provides additional guidance on substantive rights 
eitf must be applied no later than the beginning of the first quarter of  based on limited partnership agreements in place at the time of adoption 
management does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the group 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the group s results of operations 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table sets forth weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations outstanding at december   and based on effective rates as at that same date expected maturity date of debt and capital lease obligations and total thereafter us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations variable rate us dollar facilities average interest rate variable rate euro facilities average interest rate fixed rate us dollar facilities average interest rate interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december   of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the group conducted an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the balance outstanding as at december   leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase were applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk substantially all purchases of container equipment are in us dollars 
in  approximately of the group s revenues were billed and paid in us dollars and approximately of expenses were incurred and paid in us dollars 
for non us dollar denominated revenues and expenses  the group may enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk 
of the non us dollar expenses  approximately are individually small and unpredictable and were incurred in various denominations 
thus  such amounts are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
as exchange rates are outside of the control of the group  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every incremental decline in value of the us dollar against various foreign currencies  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any given year 
credit risk cronos sets maximum credit limits for all customers  limiting the number of containers leased to each customer according to established credit criteria 
cronos continually tracks its credit exposure to each customer 
cronos credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions to be taken in order to minimize credit risks 
cronos uses specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by local staff to assess credit quality
