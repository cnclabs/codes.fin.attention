introduction we are a leading information technology  or it  services company that provides a full range of specialized staffing and project implementation services and products 
the staffing services we provide allow our clients to focus their resources on their core businesses rather than on recruiting  training and managing it professionals 
in using our staffing services  our clients benefit from our extensive recruiting channels  providing our clients ready access to highly skilled and specialized it professionals  often within hours of submitting a placement request  
table of contents 
index to financial statements access to a flexible workforce  allowing our clients to manage their labor costs more effectively without compromising their it goals  and our knowledge of the market for it resources  providing our clients with qualified candidates at competitive prices 
we contract with our customers to provide both short and long term it staffing services at client locations throughout the united states 
our consultants assist our clients with a wide range of services  including website development and integration  application programming and development  client server development  systems software architecture and design  systems engineering and systems integration 
in addition to our core it staffing business  we also offer our customers services that complement our staffing activities  such as vendor management  in which we assist our clients in quantifying  consolidating  rationalizing and monitoring their procurement of temporary staffing and other services from multiple suppliers  project solutions  including software development and maintenance  network design and management and offshore application maintenance and development  and recruitment and permanent placement of it professionals 
these additional services provide us opportunities to build relationships with new clients and enhance our service offerings to our existing clients 
overview our business strategy is to become the leading provider of it staffing services in the united states and to expand on our complementary service offerings 
we intend to continue implementing our business strategy through a combination of internal growth and strategic acquisitions that complement or enhance our business 
industry trends that affect our business include rate of technological change  rate of growth in corporate it budgets  penetration of it staffing in the general workforce  outsourcing of the it workforce  and consolidation of supplier bases 
beginning in the second half of  the overall growth of the united states economy began to slow 
while this slowdown negatively affected most industry segments  it had a significant impact on the telecommunications and internet sectors 
the combination of the slowdown in the economy  which also resulted in business failures  and the uncertainty as to when an economic recovery would take place led many companies to postpone or cancel it projects 
as a result  our business declined as evidenced by a reduction in billable consultants from january through june during the economic downturn  however  we took steps to strengthen our operations and better position us to grow our business when the economic environment improved 
the steps we took included diversifying our client base  implementing consistent business practices across our organization and improving our front office and back office infrastructure 
since  we have seen signs of improvement in the industry  which can be attributed to an improvement in general economic conditions 
we believe that a continuation of the recent economic recovery will drive a renewed need for it investments and initiatives by corporate clients 
we expect this increase in it spending  combined with the need to maintain financial flexibility by using variable workforce strategies  to result in increased demand for our services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our billable consultant headcount increased from approximately  for old comsys at june  to approximately  for old comsys prior to the merger on september  our billable headcount was approximately  at january  and approximately  at january  the january  headcount included approximately consultants that we added with the acquisition of pure solutions  inc in october our consultant headcount declined in january due to normal seasonal project terminations that occur at the end of most calendar years 
we anticipate that our growth will be primarily generated from greater penetration of our service offerings with our current clients  introducing new service offerings to our customers and obtaining new clients 
our strategy for achieving this growth includes expanding our geographic presence  cross selling our vms and project solutions services to existing it staffing customers  aggressively marketing our services to new clients  expanding our range of value added services  enhancing brand recognition and making strategic acquisitions 
the success of our business depends primarily on the volume of assignments we secure  the bill rates for those assignments  the costs of the consultants that provide the services and the quality and efficiency of our recruiting  sales and marketing and administrative functions 
our brand name  our proven track record  our recruiting and candidate screening processes  our strong account management team and our efficient and consistent administrative processes are factors that we believe are key to the success of our business 
factors outside of our control  such as the demand for it services  general economic conditions and the supply of qualified it professionals  will also affect our success 
our revenue is primarily driven by bill rates and billable hours 
most of our billings for our staffing and project solutions services are on a time and materials basis  which means that we bill our customers based on pre agreed bill rates for the number of hours that each of our consultants works on an assignment 
hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications 
general economic conditions  macro it expenditure trends and competition may create pressure on our pricing 
increasingly  large customers  including those with preferred supplier arrangements  have been seeking pricing discounts in exchange for higher volumes of business 
billable hours are affected by numerous factors  such as the quality and scope of our service offerings and competition at the national and local levels 
we also generate fee income by providing vendor management and permanent placement services 
our principal operating expenses are cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services is comprised primarily of the costs of consultant labor  including employees  subcontractors and independent contractors  and related employee benefits 
approximately of our consultants are employees and the remainder are subcontractors and independent contractors 
we compensate most of our consultants only for the hours that we bill to our clients  which allows us to better match our labor costs with our revenue generation 
with respect to our consultant employees  we are responsible for employment related taxes  medical and health care costs and workers compensation 
labor costs are sensitive to shifts in the supply and demand of it professionals  as well as increases in the costs of benefits and taxes 
the principal components of selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  selling commissions  advertising  lead generation and other marketing costs and branch office expenses 
our branch office network allows us to leverage certain selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising and back office functions 
our back office functions  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  are consolidated in our shared services center in phoenix  arizona  which operates on a peoplesoft platform 
we also have a proprietary  web enabled front office exchange fox that facilitates the identification  qualification and placement of consultants in a timely manner 
we also maintain a national recruiting center  a centralized call center for scheduling sales appointments and a centralized proposals and contract services department 
we believe this scalable infrastructure allows us to provide high quality service to our customers and will facilitate our internal growth strategy and allow us to continue to integrate acquisitions rapidly

index to financial statements the merger on september   old comsys completed a merger transaction with venturi  a publicly traded it and commercial staffing company  in which comsys holding  inc was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of venturi 
concurrent with the merger  we sold venturi s commercial staffing business for million in cash and the assumption of approximately  in liabilities 
at the effective time of the merger  we changed our name to comsys it partners  inc and issued new shares of our common stock to the stockholders of old comsys  resulting in such stockholders owning approximately of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
since former old comsys stockholders owned a majority of our outstanding common stock upon consummation of the merger  old comsys was deemed the acquiring company for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
the key elements of the integration of the legacy businesses of old comsys and venturi are substantially complete  resulting in consolidation of all duplicate branch offices  deployment of our proprietary front office exchange fox information system to the venturi branch offices  standardization of compensation plans for all account managers  recruiters and managing directors  implementation of common health care and k programs  transition of the old comsys back office information system to venturi s peoplesoft system and transition of legacy venturi back office and accounting processes to our shared services operation located in phoenix  arizona  together resulting in the consolidation of all of our back office operations for comsys  including payroll  billing  accounts payable  collections and financial reporting  and elimination of a substantial number of duplicative staff positions 
in connection with the integration of the information systems  we continue to refine processes related to billing  collections and financial reporting  which we expect to complete in until such processes are fully refined  we may experience a delay in billing our customers and collections of accounts receivable

effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap 
the swap agreement and cap agreement are contracts to effectively exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments over the life of the instruments 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure to credit loss

both the senior credit agreement and second lien term loan credit agreement contain customary covenants and events of default  including the maintenance of a minimum ebitda requirement  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  as defined 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements and we believe that we will be able to comply with these covenants throughout these agreements also place restrictions on our ability to enter into certain transactions without the approval of the lenders  such as the payment of dividends  disposition and acquisition of assets and the assumption of contingent obligations

change in accountants although there were no disagreements or reportable events required to be reported pursuant to the exchange act  a change of accountants occurred during fiscal in connection with the merger 
on october   we dismissed pricewaterhousecoopers llp as our independent registered public accounting firm effective upon completion of services related to the review of our form q for the quarter ended september   and engaged ernst young llp as our new independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of our company following the merger 
these matters were approved by the audit committee of our board of directors 
prior to such engagement  ernst young llp served as the independent registered public accounting firm for old comsys  which was deemed the accounting acquirer in the merger 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  also referred to as gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates include the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves for medical costs  tax related contingencies and realization of deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our operations and include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues under time and materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of time 
table of contents 
index to financial statements incurred to total estimated time to complete the project 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recorded in the period the losses are determinable 
estimated losses on incomplete projects are determined by comparing the revenues remaining to be recognized on fixed price contracts to judgments as to estimated time and cost required to complete the projects 
if the estimated cost to complete a project exceeds the remaining revenue to be recognized  the excess cost is recorded as a loss provision on the contract 
we report revenues from vendor management services net of the related pass through labor costs 
we also report revenues net of payrolling activity 
payrolling is defined as a situation in which we accept a client identified it consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee 
revenues generated by payrollees are recorded net of labor costs 
permanent placement fee revenues are recorded when employment candidates accept offers of permanent employment 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets comsys assesses recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested annually for impairment  unless an event occurs or circumstances change during the year that reduce or may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value  in which event an impairment charge may be required during the year 
the annual test requires estimates and judgments by management to determine valuations for each reporting unit 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
different assumptions related to future cash flows  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates could result in an impairment charge  which would be recognized as a noncash charge to operating income and a reduction in asset values on the balance sheet 
at january   january  and december   total goodwill was million  million and million  respectively 
our intangible assets other than goodwill represent a customer base and  in and  contract costs  and are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer base  ranging from two to eight years 
at january   january  and december   net intangible assets were million  million and million  respectively 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets 
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets are compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary 
we believe that all of our long lived assets are fully realizable as of january  collectibility of accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
for  we also considered the impact on collections of the integration of the old comsys and venturi back office systems 
further  we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
additional allowances may be required if the economy or the financial condition of our customers deteriorates 
if we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of january   january  and december   the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements income tax assets and liabilities we record an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these deferred tax items represent expenses or operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes  which will result in tax deductions over varying future periods 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income  timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
we record an estimated tax liability or tax benefit for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we use our best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent upon various matters  including resolution of tax audits  and may differ from amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded as a provision or benefit to income tax expense in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability or benefit differs from the recorded amount 
derivatives we are a party to an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap that mature in september as discussed above  until december the swap and cap were designated as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
the combined net fair value of the swap and cap is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  as an asset in the amount of  the offsetting amount for the net fair value of our interest rate swap and cap was recorded in other comprehensive income within the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet until the repayment of our debt on december  effective with this repayment  the expected cash flows that the swap and cap were designated to hedge against were no longer probable and the swap and the cap are no longer designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with changes in fair value of the hedges were reversed to interest expense 
changes in fair value of the swap and cap are recorded in the statement of operations subsequent to december  the company recorded  as a reduction of interest expense in the fourth quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk outstanding debt under our senior and term loan credit agreements at january  was million 
interest on borrowings under the facility is based on the prime rate or libor plus a variable margin 
based on the outstanding balance at january   a change of in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
because our borrowings have variable interest rates  we have historically been subject to market risk on all or a part of our borrowings under our credit agreements 
effective february   we entered into an interest rate swap and an interest rate cap 
the swap agreement and cap agreement are contracts to effectively exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed rate payments of the life of the instrument 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure to credit loss

the interest rate swap and cap are recorded at fair value  based on an amount estimated by merrill lynch capital  which represents the amount that merrill lynch capital would have paid us at january  if the swap and cap had been terminated at that date
