throughout fiscal  the company continued to struggle with declining sales performance 
challenged with how to increase customer traffic and differentiate itself from the growing competition  the company implemented several key initiatives 
to regain its position as a unique specialty retailer  the company is focusing on merchandising and marketing strategies as well as prudent management of the business through cost reductions and other restructuring plans throughout the organization 
through market research and customer feedback  the company determined that the stores needed an updated look  complete with new merchandise lines and a redesigned store format 
market research showed that customers are looking for a less is more style of home furnishings  with more efficient and convenient shopping options 
as a result  the company has introduced a new line of merchandise with more contemporary designs  updated color palettes and a modern look 
in addition to shelf displays  customers entering pier stores will now find merchandise arrangements designed to fit into particular areas of the home such as the living room  dining room  bedroom or patio 
the new merchandise is displayed in a manner that allows the customers to imagine what it would look like in their own homes  as well as showing them how to incorporate different accessories into their living areas 
this simplified  less cluttered visual presentation was partially achieved by reducing the total number of skus at the stores 
in addition  the company recently implemented a new rapid replenishment process in its stores where more merchandise is now held at the distribution centers rather than in stores and is restocked as merchandise sells 
this new process has removed at least a week from the restocking time in stores and helped to maintain the clean  contemporary look of the stores 
also  during the fourth quarter the company doubled 
table of contents its number of outlet stores to help with the flow of merchandise and to keep the stores from appearing cluttered as the company transitions merchandise throughout the year 
in addition to the new merchandise initiatives  the company has implemented new marketing strategies including new television advertisements  catalog mailings  magazine advertisements  and direct mail and internet marketing 
the company has returned to television advertising after discontinuing this form of advertising in the latter half of fiscal and has discontinued the use of newspaper inserts for now 
the company began test marketing its catalog through limited mailings late in fiscal and again in early fiscal and decided to expand the mailings of catalogs with two nation wide distributions during the fall and holiday season of fiscal customer response was positive and the company has decided to continue to expand this form of marketing and discontinue the use of newspaper inserts 
the catalog offers an opportunity to show product to its best advantage  to suggest its use in home settings and to demonstrate the value proposition 
in march  the company circulated ten million copies of the spring catalog 
in april  the company circulated a late spring edition of the catalog and will follow it with a summer catalog in may 
in all  the company plans to distribute nine direct mail catalogs throughout fiscal the company s management feels that the catalogs will play an increasingly important role in the overall marketing plan as well as provide the company with future business opportunities 
almost all items available through catalogs and internet shopping are also available in stores 
in an effort to reduce costs and focus on the core business  the company has made several key changes throughout the year  as follows the company s management reviewed and identified key areas of the company where cost reduction and cost restructuring would be beneficial 
as a result  the company made the decision to integrate pier kids operations within pier more fully by moving its administrative functions to pier s corporate headquarters and utilizing the savannah distribution center for distribution to pier kids stores 
in addition  the company centralized the field administration function  reduced the number of regions and districts and eliminated associated support functions  and reduced the staffing of the real estate function 
also  overall information technology spending was reduced where practical and a number of corporate administrative positions were eliminated 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s management began a comprehensive evaluation of its real estate portfolio of pier and pier kids stores 
as a result of this evaluation  the company s management decided to close stores in fiscal  compared to the original plan to close  and expects to close in fiscal the increase in closures is an effort to focus on the stores in the higher performing markets and not continue to invest resources in marginal or underperforming stores 
lastly  management decided to sell the pier stores located in the united kingdom and ireland 
managing operations in distant locations was a management distraction  and the company has chosen to focus on operations in north america 
additionally  the stores opened in north america have historically provided a higher return on investment than those opened in the united kingdom  and the company determined that it would be a better use of its capital to focus its expansion efforts in north america 
despite a difficult year  the company s management continues to focus on managing inventory levels and controlling operating expenses prudently 
the company plans to continue to monitor customer preferences as they shift each season  and to adjust the company s marketing and merchandising strategies to meet the needs of its customers 
customers have responded favorably to the new merchandising and marketing strategies and management believes that the steps it is taking will help to increase customer traffic and sales

a summary of the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of february  is listed below in thousands amount of commitment per period less than to to more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations convertible debt standby letters of credit industrial revenue bonds interest on convertible debt interest on industrial revenue bonds interest and related fees on secured credit facility other long term obligations total liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  commitments not recorded on the balance sheet  total  as of february   the company had approximately million of outstanding purchase orders  which were primarily related to merchandise inventory 
such orders are generally cancelable at the discretion of the company until the order has been shipped 
the table above excludes certain immaterial executory contracts for goods and services that tend to be recurring in nature and similar in amount year over year and includes million in merchandise letters of credit 
the company s convertible debt is subject to redemption in part or full on february   and the above amounts assume the notes will be repaid at that time 
if all notes remain outstanding until maturity  the total interest paid would be million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s convertible senior notes 
the company also has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million related to the company s industrial revenue bonds 
this amount is excluded from the table above as it is not incremental to the company s total outstanding commitments 
the interest rates on the company s industrial revenue bonds are variable and reset weekly 
the estimated interest payments included in the table were calculated based upon the rate in effect at fiscal year end 
represents estimated commitment fees for trade and standby letters of credit  and unused fees on the company s million secured credit facility  which expires in november and were calculated based upon balances and rates in effect at fiscal year end 

table of contents other long term obligations represent the company s liability under various unfunded retirement plans and certain deferred compensation agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s employee benefit plans 
the above amounts do not include payments that may be due under post employment consulting agreements with certain employees 
the terms and amounts under such agreements are disclosed in the proxy statement for the company s annual meeting of shareholders 
the present value of total existing minimum operating lease commitments discounted at was million at fiscal year end 
the company plans to fund these commitments from cash generated from the operations of the company and from borrowings against lines of credit 
during fiscal  the company plans to open new pier stores and close approximately stores as leases expire or are otherwise ended 
in addition  the company plans to close five pier kids stores 
new store locations will be financed primarily through operating leases 
additionally  the company began operating its new distribution center in tacoma  washington in march   which is leased under an operating lease 
total capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
of this amount  the company expects to spend approximately million on store development  million on information systems enhancements and approximately million primarily related to the company s distribution centers 
in summary  the company s primary uses of cash in fiscal were to fund operating expenses  provide for new and existing store development  fund capital additions related to distribution centers and information systems development  and pay dividends and repurchase common stock of the company 
historically  the company has financed its operations primarily from internally generated funds and borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
in recent months the company has also received proceeds from a convertible debt offering and from the sale of its subsidiary  the pier  and may also consider other strategic alternatives such as the sale of its credit card business 
the company believes that the funds provided from operations  available lines of credit  proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt and sales of its proprietary credit card receivables will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditure requirements throughout fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases and letters of credit discussed above  the company s only other off balance sheet arrangement relates to the securitization of the company s proprietary credit card receivables 
on a daily basis  the company sells its proprietary credit card receivables that meet certain eligibility criteria to a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary  pier funding  llc funding  which transfers the receivables to pier imports credit card master trust the master trust 
the master trust has issued million face amount of debt securities the class a certificates to a third party 
this securitization of receivables provides the company with a portion of its funding 
however  neither funding nor the master trust is consolidated in the company s financial statements  and the company has no obligation to reimburse funding  the master trust or purchasers of class a certificates for credit losses from the receivables 
during fiscal  the company s securitization agreements were amended to  among other things  extend the expiration date until september and to increase the amount of class b certificates required to be held by funding for the benefit and protection of class a certificate holders from approximately million to approximately million if the company s credit ratings fall below certain required minimums 
the company s credit rating fell below this minimum and in february   the class b certificates were increased to million raising the minimum amount of receivables necessary to avoid repayment of the class a certificates 
should the balance of the underlying credit card receivables held by the master trust decline to a level that the class a certificates become insufficiently collateralized  the master trust would be contractually required to repay a portion of the class a certificates from daily collections  thereby reducing funds available for purchases of newly generated proprietary credit card receivables 
at the end of fiscal  the underlying credit card receivables held by the master trust were million and would have had to fall below million before a repayment 
table of contents would have been required 
this repayment would only be to the extent necessary to maintain the required ratio of receivables to the class a certificates as set forth in the securitization agreement 
in addition  the failure of the master trust to comply with its required performance measures  such as payment rate  dilution rate  portfolio yield and minimum transferor s interest  the failure of the company to meet the minimum credit rating requirement  or other material adverse changes in the company s credit quality  would trigger an early amortization event 
such an event would eliminate the securitization as a source of funding for the company 
the performance measures would have to deteriorate significantly from their current levels  or the credit rating would have to fall more than one notch to result in such an early amortization event 
if either an early amortization event had occurred  or the company had been required to consolidate the master trust due to a change in accounting rules  the company s statement of operations for fiscal would not have been materially different from its reported results 
an early amortization event would require the repayment of the class a certificates by the master trust  thereby reducing funds available for purchases of newly generated proprietary credit card receivables 
the consolidation of the master trust would result in an increase of approximately million in both the company s assets and liabilities as of february  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the beneficial interest in securitized receivables 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates that affect the reported value of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for the company s conclusions 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as the business and the economic environment changes 
historically  actual results have not varied materially from the company s estimates  with the exception of impairments as discussed below  and the company does not currently anticipate a significant change in its assumptions related to these estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
unless specifically addressed below  the company does not believe that its critical accounting policies are subject to market risk exposure that would be considered material and as a result  has not provided a sensitivity analysis 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the consolidated financial statements  but the accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from retail sales  net of sales tax  upon customer receipt or delivery of merchandise  including sales under deferred payment promotions on its proprietary credit card 
typically  credit card receivable deferral programs offer deferred payments for up to days or monthly installment payments over months 
historically these payment deferral programs have not resulted in significant increases in bad debt losses arising from such receivables 
the company records an allowance for estimated merchandise returns based on historical experience and other known factors 
should actual returns differ from the company s estimates and current provision for merchandise returns  revisions to the estimated merchandise returns may be required 
gift cards revenue associated with gift cards is deferred until redemption of the gift card 
gift card breakage is estimated and recorded as income based upon an analysis of the company s historical redemption patterns and represents the remaining unused portion of the gift card liability for which the likelihood of redemption is remote 
if actual redemption patterns vary from the company s estimates  actual gift card breakage may differ from the amounts recorded 
beneficial interest in securitized receivables the company securitizes its entire portfolio of proprietary credit card receivables 
during fiscal  and  the company sold all of its proprietary credit card receivables  except an immaterial amount of those that failed certain eligibility 
table of contents requirements  to a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary  pier funding  llc funding  which transferred the receivables to the pier imports credit card master trust the master trust 
neither funding nor the master trust is consolidated by the company  and the master trust meets the requirements of a qualifying special purpose entity under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the master trust issues beneficial interests that represent undivided interests in the assets of the master trust consisting of the transferred receivables and all cash flows from collections of such receivables 
the beneficial interests include certain interests retained by funding  which are represented by class b certificates  and the residual interest in the master trust the excess of the principal amount of receivables held in the master trust over the portion represented by the certificates sold to third party investors and the class b certificates 
gain or loss on the sale of receivables depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
the beneficial interest in the master trust is accounted for as an available for sale security and is recorded at fair value 
the company estimates fair value of its beneficial interest in the master trust  both upon initial securitization and thereafter  based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of key assumptions including credit losses and payment rates 
as of february  and february   the company s assumptions used to calculate the present value of the future cash flows included estimated credit losses of and  respectively  of the outstanding balance  expected payment within a six month period and a discount rate representing the average market rate the company would expect to pay if it sold securities representing ownership in the excess receivables not required to collateralize the class a certificates 
a sensitivity analysis performed assuming a hypothetical adverse change in both interest rates and credit losses resulted in an immaterial impact on the fair value of the company s beneficial interest 
although not anticipated by the company  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the company s credit card holders  interest rates or other economic conditions could result in other than temporary losses on the beneficial interest in future periods 
inventories the company s inventory is comprised of finished merchandise and is stated at the lower of average cost or market  cost being determined on a weighted average inventory method 
cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the company s warehouse using actual vendor invoices  the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores and other direct costs associated with purchasing products 
carrying values of inventory are analyzed and to the extent that the cost of inventory exceeds the expected selling prices less reasonable costs to sell  provisions are made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and uses merchandise markdowns to sell such merchandise 
markdowns are recorded to reduce the retail price of such slow moving merchandise as needed 
since the determination of carrying values of inventory involves both estimation and judgment with regard to market values and reasonable costs to sell  differences in these estimates could result in ultimate valuations that differ from the recorded asset 
the company recognizes known inventory losses  shortages and damages when incurred and makes a provision for estimated shrinkage 
the amount of the provision is estimated based on historical experience from the results of its physical inventories 
inventory is physically counted at substantially all locations at least once in each month period  at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements 
physical counts were taken at substantially all stores and distribution centers during fiscal although inventory shrink rates have not fluctuated significantly in recent years  should actual rates differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the inventory shrink expense may be required 
most inventory purchases and commitments are made in united states dollars 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets such as buildings  equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements are reviewed at the store level for impairment at least annually and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows  the asset is impaired 

table of contents expected cash flows are estimated based on management s estimate of changes in sales  merchandise margins  and expenses over the remaining expected terms of the leases 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows 
impairment  if any  is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurred and the company recorded million in impairment charges in fiscal as the projection of future cash flows requires the use of judgment and estimates  if actual results differ from the company s estimates  additional charges for asset impairments may be recorded in the future 
insurance provision the company is self insured with respect to medical coverage offered to eligible employees except that claims in excess of  per occurrence per year are covered by a purchased insurance policy 
the company records a provision for estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
such claim amounts are estimated based on historical average claims per covered individual per month and on the average historical lag time between the covered event and the time it is paid by the company 
the liability for estimated medical claims incurred but not reported at february  was million 
during fiscal  the company maintained insurance for workers compensation and general liability claims with a deductible of  and  respectively  per claim 
the liability recorded for such claims is determined by estimating the total future claims cost for events that occurred prior to the balance sheet date 
the estimates consider historical claims development factors as well as information obtained from and projections made by the company s insurance carrier and underwriters 
the recorded liabilities for workers compensation and general liability claims at february  were million and million  respectively 
the assumptions made in determining the above estimates are reviewed continually and the liability adjusted accordingly as new facts are revealed 
changes in circumstances and conditions affecting the assumptions used in determining the liabilities could cause actual results to differ from the company s recorded amounts 
pension costs the company maintains supplemental retirement plans the plans for certain of its executive officers 
the plans provide that upon death  disability or reaching retirement age  a participant will receive benefits based on highest compensation and years of service 
these benefit costs are dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates 
benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
income taxes the company records income tax expense using the liability method for taxes 
the company is subject to income tax in many jurisdictions  including the united states  various states and localities  and foreign countries 
at any point in time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various jurisdictions and the company records reserves for estimates of probable tax exposures of foreign and domestic tax audits 
the results and timing of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
the process of determining tax expense by jurisdiction involves the calculation of actual current tax expense or benefit  together with the assessment of deferred tax expense resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
if different assumptions had been used  the company s tax expense or benefit  assets and liabilities could have varied from recorded amounts 
if actual results differ from estimated results or if the company adjusts these assumptions in the future  the company may need to adjust its deferred tax assets or liabilities  which could impact its effective tax rate 
the company is relying on future taxable income to utilize the majority of the net deferred tax asset of  based upon the company s earnings history  its earnings projections and length of time within which to utilize the asset the tax loss carryforward period of years  management believes it is more 
table of contents likely than not that the tax benefits of the asset will be realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided on deferred taxes related to continuing operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company during the preceding three years 
impact of new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including stock options  at fair value 
the statement will be effective for public companies no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year commencing after june   which for the company is the beginning of fiscal in march  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab summarizes the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and is intended to assist in the initial implementation of sfas r 
the company will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method and is currently evaluating the effect that sfas r and sab will have on its consolidated balance sheets and its statements of shareholders equity and cash flows 
the company estimates equity compensation costs to be in the range of million to million for fiscal depending on the timing and number of stock options and restricted shares granted during fiscal sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions for the years ended february   february  and february  were not material 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies terminology within sfas no 
and requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces apb no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas will have no impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows unless at a future date the company has a change in accounting principle or correction of an error 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
this guidance 
table of contents requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
this guidance was effective for interim reporting periods beginning after june   and is applicable only to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after the effective date 
the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
the guidance requires rental costs for operating leases during the construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
the guidance permits either retroactive or prospective treatment for periods beginning after december  the company currently complies with this guidance and  therefore  the application of fsp is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments  does not use them for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
collectively  the company s exposure to market risk factors is not significant and has not materially changed from february  foreign currency risk the company periodically enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
the company uses such contracts to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies  primarily euros 
the company also uses contracts to hedge its exposure associated with repatriation of funds from its canadian operations 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as such contracts are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
forward contracts that hedge merchandise purchases generally have maturities not exceeding six months 
changes in the fair value and settlement of these forwards are included in cost of sales 
contracts which hedge the repatriation of canadian funds have maturities not exceeding months and changes in the fair value and settlement of these contracts are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
at february   there were no outstanding contracts to hedge exposure associated with the company s merchandise purchases denominated in foreign currencies or the repatriation of canadian funds 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt 
the interest rate exposure on the company s secured credit facility and industrial revenue bonds is based upon variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of february   the company had million in borrowings outstanding on its industrial revenue bonds and no cash borrowings outstanding on its secured credit facility 
a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rates applicable to either or both of these variable rate instruments would have a negligible impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
additionally  the company has million in convertible senior notes  which mature in february the notes pay a fixed annual rate of for the first five years and a fixed rate of thereafter 
changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt instruments  but would not affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows related to these notes
