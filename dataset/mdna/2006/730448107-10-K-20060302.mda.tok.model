item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s financial results are most directly affected by changing prices for its production 
changing prices can influence not only current results of operations but the determination of the company s proved reserves and available sources of financing  including the determination of the borrowing base under its bank credit facility 
the company s results depend not only on hydrocarbon prices generally  but on its ability to market its production on favorable terms 
on a longer term basis  the company s financial condition and results of operations are affected by its ability to replace reserves as they are produced through successful exploration  development and acquisition activities 
the company s results could also be adversely affected by adverse regulatory developments and operational risks associated with oil and gas operations 
for further discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s results  see risk factors and the discussion below 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations reflects the recasting as discontinued operations of the company s thailand and hungary operations 
see executive overview closed sale of thailand 
except where noted  the following discussion relates to the company s continuing activities only 
executive overview the company s objective is to explore for  develop  acquire and produce oil and gas in select locations 
in pursuit of that objective  the company s goal for each year is to add more oil and gas reserves than it produces 
the year marked the fourteenth consecutive year of reserve replacement for the company 
the company pursues a balanced approach in core areas located in major oil and gas provinces in the united states and internationally 
the company follows a strict set of criteria when selecting areas of the world in which to explore 
areas selected are viewed as having proven oil and gas resources  having reasonable economic terms and possessing low political risk 
following these criteria  the company operates internationally in onshore canada and also conducts exploration activities in offshore new zealand 
the company also seeks to maintain a balanced mixture of the gas oil ratio of its proven reserves base 
over the last several years  the company has transitioned from a predominately offshore focused company to a company with the majority of its reserves located in the onshore regions of north america 
as of december   approximately of the company s reserves are located onshore 
as a result of this transition  the company has lengthened its reserves to production index to over years 
at the end of  proven reserves reached  bcfe and production for the year averaged more than  boe per day  mcfe per day 
oil and gas pricing and production volumes are important components of an exploration and development company s growth in net income and cash flow 
in  oil and gas pricing for the company was strong  with the average price increasing over on an equivalent barrel basis 
oil and gas capital and exploration cash expenditures for were approximately billion 
exploration and development operations were allocated approximately million  and approximately billion was spent on selective acquisitions in the company s core areas of operations 
for  in the company s continuing operations  wells were drilled with successfully completed  a success rate 
during  approximately bcfe of proven reserves were added to the company s reserves ledger 
closed acquisition of northrock resources on september   the company completed the acquisition of northrock resources ltd 
for approximately billion in cash 
the purchase price of northrock was funded using available cash on hand  the net proceeds from the company s offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in september and additional borrowings under the credit facility 
as of december   northrock owned bcfe of estimated proven reserves on approximately  net acres  plus approximately  net acres of undeveloped leasehold 
northrock s exploitation and development activities are concentrated in saskatchewan and alberta with key exploration plays in canada s northwest territories  british columbia and the alberta foothills 
the company expects to have an active drilling program in canada in  allocating approximately million of capital to drill wells 
by allocating significant resources and capital  the company anticipates growth in both reserves and production from this important new area 
closed sale of thailand on august   the company closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary thaipo ltd 
and its interest in b partners ltd  effectively a sale of all of its thailand operations  for a purchase price of million 
the company recognized an after tax gain from discontinued operations of approximately million on the transaction 
hurricanes katrina and rita on august   after passing through the gulf of mexico  hurricane katrina made landfall near new orleans  louisiana and caused one of the worst natural disasters in us history 
on september   hurricane rita  one of the strongest measured hurricanes to have entered the gulf of mexico  made landfall between sabine pass  texas and johnson s bayou  louisiana 
due to the hurricanes  substantially all of the company s gulf of mexico production was shut in and  as of february   approximately  bbls of oil and mmcf of natural gas of the company s net daily production remain shut in as a result of the storms 
one of the platforms the company operates  located in main pass block  sustained major damage and significant damage to platforms and pipelines operated by others occurred  including facilities that are located in viosca knoll block  eugene island block  and south marsh island block the company expects production to come back on line by the end of the first quarter of also  damage to processing plants and other onshore infrastructure owned and operated by others will likely continue to delay some of the shut in production from coming back on line 
the company maintains business interruption insurance on some of its blocks in the gulf 
senior subordinated notes issuances in march  the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the offering were used to reduce outstanding senior indebtedness under the company s revolving credit facility 
in september  the company issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due proceeds from the offering were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the northrock acquisition 
share repurchases during  the company announced a share repurchase plan 
the company is authorized to expend up to a maximum of million dollars to effect the repurchases 
as of february   million shares of company stock have been repurchased for million  which represents approximately of the company s outstanding shares as of january  results total revenue for was  million and net income from continuing operations totaled million  or per share 
cash flow from continuing operations totaled million 
as of december   long term debt was  million  increasing from december  by million 
the company s debt to total capitalization ratio  an indicator of a company s financial strength  was at december  and cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to approximately million at december  the increase in debt and the decrease in cash are both due primarily to the closing of the northrock acquisition 
capital budget the company has established a million exploration and development budget excluding property acquisitions 
the company expects to spend approximately million on exploration and million on development activities 
the capital budget calls for the drilling of approximately wells during  including wells in the united states and canada 
production outlook update the company currently expects its production volumes to average approximately  boepd during in addition  the company currently expects its production volumes to exit at approximately  boepd 
these estimates are subject to change  and actual results could differ materially  depending upon the amount of gulf of mexico production that remains shut in  the timing of any such production coming back on line  the availability of oilfield services  acquisitions  divestitures and many other factors that are beyond the company s control 
please read forward looking statements 
exposure to oil and gas prices and availability of oilfield services oil and natural gas prices have historically been seasonal  cyclical and volatile 
prices depend on many factors that the company cannot control such as weather and economic  political and regulatory conditions 
the average prices the company is currently receiving for production are higher than historical average prices 
a future drop in oil and gas prices could have a serious adverse effect on cash flow and profitability 
sustained periods of low prices could have a serious adverse effect on the company s operations and financial condition 
additionally  the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells and installing facilities and pipelines is often uncertain and have each increased substantially during the market for oil field services is currently very competitive and shortages or delays in delivery or availability of equipment or fabrication yards could impact the company s ability to conduct oil and gas drilling and completion operations 
results of operations oil and gas revenues the company s oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for  which were an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for the following table reflects an analysis of variances in the company s oil and gas revenues expressed in thousands between years compared to compared to increase decrease in oil and gas revenues resulting from variances in natural gas price

the increase in the company s natural gas production during  compared to  was primarily related to acquisitions made during and late and  to a lesser extent  increased production from the success of the company s exploration program at its los mogotes field in south texas 
these production gains were partially offset by shut in production resulting from the infrastructure damage caused by hurricane ivan in the final months of and natural production declines at other properties 
crude oil and condensate production 
the decrease in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to  resulted primarily from the shut in of gulf of mexico platforms due to the effects of hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita including main pass block during and  to a lesser extent  natural production declines 
this decrease was partially offset by the addition of production from the northrock acquisition made on september  the decrease in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to  resulted primarily from shut in production related to the infrastructure damage caused by hurricane ivan in the final quarter of and natural production declines at the company s main pass blocks field in the gulf of mexico

the increase in lease operating expenses for  compared to  is due primarily to increased expenses incurred on the properties acquired by the company during and the latter part of  increased maintenance expenses on several of the company s significant offshore properties related to the effects of hurricane ivan and also to increased expenses incurred as the company continues to expand production in the los mogotes field in south texas 
on a per unit of production basis  the company s total lease operating expenses were per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the increased unit costs in were primarily related to the increased expense and the decreased production volumes discussed above 
general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for  compared with  is primarily related to increases in the size of the company s workforce due to acquisitions  increased benefit expenses and normal increases in compensation 
the company currently expects general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods with the addition of northrock related expenses for an entire reporting period

on a per unit of production basis  the company s general and administrative expenses were per mcfe in  per mcfe in and per mcfe in exploration expenses exploration expenses consist primarily of exploratory geological and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred and rental payments required under oil and gas leases to hold non producing properties delay rentals 
the increase in exploration expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from increased seismic operations in the company s new zealand and canadian operations  which were partially offset by decreased d seismic acquisition activities in the gulf of mexico and decreased seismic operations in the company s gulf coast region 
the increase in exploration expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from increased d seismic acquisition activities in the gulf of mexico and increased seismic operations in the company s gulf coast region 
dry hole and impairment expenses dry hole and impairment expenses relate to costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled and impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the company drilled gross unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest for a total cost of approximately million  in the company drilled unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest for a total cost of million  and in the company drilled unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest for a total cost of million 
generally accepted accounting principles require that if the expected future cash flow of the company s reserves on a proved property fall below the cost that is recorded on the company s books  these costs must be impaired and written down to the property s fair value 
depending on market conditions  including the prices for oil and natural gas  and the results of operations  a similar test may be conducted at any time to determine whether impairments are appropriate 
depending on the results of this test  an impairment could be required on some of the company s proved properties and this impairment could have a material negative non cash impact on the company s earnings and balance sheet 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
the evaluation of unproved properties requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of leasehold and exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn unproved properties 
as a result of its review of proved and unproved properties  the company recognized impairments to oil and gas properties of approximately million during  approximately million during and million during depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses the company s provision for dd a expense is based on its capitalized costs and is determined on a cost center by cost center basis using the units of production method 
the company generally establishes cost centers on the basis of an oil or gas trend or play for its onshore oil and gas activities 
the company generally creates cost centers on a field by field basis for oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico 
the increase in the company s dd a expense for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increased dd a rate caused by a decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are lower than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate principally properties in the gulf of mexico which were shut in due to hurricane downtime and a corresponding increase in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are higher than the company s recent historical composite rate principally increased production from properties acquired by corporate acquisitions

accretion expense increased in compared to due to increased estimates of future liabilities due to rising service costs and the acquisition of northrock in the third quarter of gas inventory purchases are related solely to the company s canadian operations and were therefore not present in and interest interest charges 
the increase in the company s interest charges for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt during the company incurred approximately million in additional debt in connection with the northrock acquisition  which had a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
the decrease in the company s interest charges for  compared to  resulted primarily from a decrease in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt during the first eleven months of the year and the repayment of higher cost debt during the year  resulting in a lower weighted average cost of debt 
the company incurred million in additional debt during december primarily related to acquisitions  but this did not have a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
interest income 
the increase in the company s interest income for  compared to and resulted from an increase in the amount of cash and cash equivalents temporarily invested 
the cash and cash equivalents invested during increased primarily due to the sales proceeds from the sale of the thailand entities 
these proceeds were subsequently used to fund a portion of the northrock purchase 
capitalized interest 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are required to be capitalized until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if projects are evaluated as successful 
the increase in capitalized interest for  compared to  resulted from an increase in the average amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately 
the decrease in capitalized interest for  compared to  resulted from a decrease in the weighted average rate on borrowings incurred by the company discussed above under results of operations interest charges and applied to such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest  partially offset by an increase in the average amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately 
commodity derivative expense commodity derivative expense for represents losses on derivative contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
although all of the company s collars are effective as economic hedges  the forecasted shut in hydrocarbon production from the company s gulf of mexico properties resulting primarily from hurricane activity during the third quarter of caused certain of the gas and crude oil collar contracts to lose their qualification for hedge accounting under sfas the forecasted hydrocarbon production used to identify those derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting is subject to change based on the condition of third party infrastructure including pipelines  onshore facilities and many other factors 
if hydrocarbon production is deferred beyond the currently forecast schedule  additional contracts may lose their qualification for hedge accounting and further adjustments may be necessary 
no such expense was incurred during either or  as all of the company s derivative contracts qualified for hedge accounting at that time 
loss on debt extinguishment the loss on debt extinguishment for is related to redemption premiums paid and or unamortized debt issuance costs which were expensed due to the redemption of the notes and the replacement of the company s previous bank credit facility with a new credit facility 
the loss on debt extinguishment for is related to redemption premiums paid and unamortized debt issuance costs which were expensed due to the redemption of the notes and notes

the company s consolidated effective tax rate for  and was   and  respectively 
the company currently expects its effective tax rate to decrease approximately to percentage points over the next two years  based on current earnings levels 
this reduction is expected due to the favorable impact of cross border financing related to the acquisition of northrock resources  reductions in the statutory federal income tax rates in canada from approximately to  the phase in of a deduction in canada for crown royalties  and the phase in of the deduction for qualified domestic production activities in the united states 
discontinued operations the thailand entities and pogo hungary are classified as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements

the decrease in revenues and expenses was primarily caused by the absence of thailand revenues and expenses after the sale date 
the decrease in income from discontinued operations for  compared to  primarily relates to dry hole and impairment costs incurred in hungary and to increased special remunitory benefit srb costs incurred in the kingdom of thailand  which were only partially offset by increased revenues in the kingdom of thailand 
the company recognized no tax benefit for its costs in hungary  resulting in a high effective tax rate for each of the periods presented 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the company adopted sfas no

upon initial application of sfas  the company recorded an after tax charge to recognize the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  this charge was required in order to recognize a liability for any existing aros adjusted for cumulative accretion  and also to increase the carrying amount of the associated long lived asset and its accumulated depreciation 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development  acquisition and production of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of income taxes 
the company funds its exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budgets capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
the company adjusts capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition results and cash flow 
the company has historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities  available cash  debt  and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all other cash needs 
the company s cash flow provided by operating activities for was  this compares to cash flow from operating activities of  in and  in the resulting changes are attributable to the reasons described under results of operations above 
cash flow from operating activities during was more than adequate to fund  in cash expenditures  for continuing operations and  for discontinued operations for capital and exploration projects and property acquisitions  excluding corporate acquisition transactions

a summary of the company s known contractual obligations as of december  are set forth on the following table payments due by period in millions less than more than total year years years years long term debt a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c asset retirement obligations d other obligations e total a includes interest on fixed rate debt  but excludes variable rate interest expense on the company s bank credit facility 
b operating leases principally include the company s office lease commitments  gas storage fee commitments and various other equipment rentals  including gas compressors 
where rented equipment such as compressors is considered essential to the operation of the lease  the company has assumed that such equipment will be leased for the estimated productive life of the reserves  even if the contract terminates prior to such date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
c this represents i the company s share of the contractual commitments for drilling rigs that have a term greater than six months or which cannot be terminated at the end of the well that is currently being drilled and ii firm transportation agreements representing ship or pay arrangements whereby the company has committed to ship certain volumes of gas for a fixed transportation fee principally from the madden field in wyoming 
the company entered into these arrangements to ensure its access to gas markets and expects to produce sufficient volumes to satisfy substantially all of its firm transportation obligations 
d this represents the company s estimate of future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including the rate of inflation  changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
e this represents the company s estimate of retention bonus payments to be made to those persons employed by northrock as of september   if those persons remain employees of northrock on september  commitments under joint operating agreements 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  the company operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
the contractual obligations set forth above represent the company s working interest share of the contractual commitments that it has entered into as operator and  to the extent that it is aware  the contractual commitments entered into by the operator of projects that the company does not operate 
surety bonds 
in the ordinary course of the company s business and operations  it is required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies  primarily to cover self insurance  site restoration  equipment dismantlement  plugging and abandonment obligations 
as of december   the company had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain operations in the united states in the aggregate amount of approximately million that are not included in the table presented above 
in connection with their administration of offshore leases in the gulf of mexico  the mms annually evaluates each lessee s plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the mms reviews this information and applies certain financial tests including  but not limited to  current asset and net worth tests 
the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the company must annually provide the mms with financial information 
if the company does not satisfy the mms requirements  it could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  the company has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
the company cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto and therefore has not included them in the prior table  but the amount could be substantial 
guarantees and letters of credit 
as of february   approximately million in letters of credit had been issued on the company s behalf relating to its canadian operations

the company has a revolving credit facility the credit agreement that provides for a billion revolving loan facility terminating on december  the amount that may be borrowed under the credit agreement may not exceed a borrowing base determined at least semiannually using the administrative agent s usual and customary criteria for oil and gas reserve valuation  adjusted for incurrences of other indebtedness since the last redetermination of the borrowing base 
as of february   the borrowing base was billion 
the credit agreement provides that in specified circumstances involving an increase in ratings assigned to pogo s debt  pogo may elect for the borrowing base limitation to no longer apply to restrict available borrowings 
the next redetermination of the borrowing base is expected to occur by may  a significant decline in the prices that the company is expected to receive for its future oil and gas production could have a material negative impact on the borrowing base under the credit agreement which  in turn  could have a material negative impact on the company s liquidity 
if at a redetermination of the borrowing base  the lenders reduce the borrowing base below the amount then outstanding under the credit agreement and other senior debt arrangements  the company must repay the excess to the lenders in no more than four substantially equal monthly installments  commencing not later than days after the company is notified of the new borrowing base 
the credit agreement includes procedures for additional financial institutions selected by the company to become lenders under the agreement  or for any existing lender to increase its commitment in an amount approved by the company and the lender  subject to a maximum of million for all such increases in commitments of new or existing lenders 
the credit agreement also permits short term swing line loans up to million and the issuance of letters of credit up to million  which in each case reduce the credit available for revolving credit borrowings 
as of february   there was million outstanding under the credit agreement 
application of critical accounting policies and management s estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  on a periodic basis and bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but such costs are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
in most cases  a gain or loss is recognized for sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management s judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
on occasion  wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and in such instances an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within a productive oil and gas field are typically treated as development costs and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the proved reserve areas and therefore management must estimate the portion of seismic costs to expense as exploratory 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company enters a new exploratory area in hopes of finding oil and gas reserves 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and the associated costs will be expensed as dry hole costs 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves are later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the company had upward reserve revisions equivalent to  and of proved reserves during the years ended december   and  respectively 
these reserve revisions resulted primarily from improved performance from a variety of sources such as additional recoveries below previously established lowest known hydrocarbon levels  improved drainage from natural drive mechanisms  and the realization of improved drainage areas 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense would increase 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company s proved reserve estimate at december  of would result in an annual increase in dd a expense of approximately million 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows from its proved oil and gas properties and compares these future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to its fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
the company has recognized impairment expense in  and given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that will require the company to record an impairment of its oil and gas properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future nor that they will not be material 
fair values of derivative instruments the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
historically  substantially all of the company s derivative instruments have initially represented cash flow hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
therefore  while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated at the end of each reporting period  the related changes in such fair values are not included in the company s consolidated results of operations  to the extent they are expected to offset the future cash flows from oil and natural gas production 
instead  the changes in fair value of hedging instruments are recorded directly to shareholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
the estimation of fair values for the company s hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the company estimates the fair values of its derivatives on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
to utilize the option pricing model  the company uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using the company s current borrowing rates under its revolving credit facility 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
historically  the majority of the company s derivative instruments have been hedges of the price of crude oil and natural gas production 
the company is not involved in any derivative trading activities 
derivative contracts that do not initially qualify for hedge accounting treatment or lose their qualification for hedge accounting treatment such as those contracts that lost the qualification for hedge accounting treatment during due to curtailed production resulting from hurricane damage are carried at their fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company recognizes all changes in the fair value of these contracts in the company s consolidated results of operations in the period in which the change occurs in the caption commodity derivative expense 
business combinations acquisitions in  the company grew through the acquisition of northrock resources 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life are assessed for impairment at least annually 
the company has never recorded any goodwill in connection with its business combinations acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not do so in the future 
there are various assumptions made by the company in determining the fair values of an acquired company s assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired 
to determine the estimated fair value of both proved and unproved properties  the company prepares estimates of oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
these estimates are based on work performed by the company s engineers and outside petroleum reservoir consultants 
the judgments associated with the estimation of reserves are described earlier in this section 
the fair value of the estimated reserves acquired in a business combination is then calculated based on the company s estimates of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices 
the company s estimates of future prices are based on its own analysis of pricing trends 
these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics  such as economic growth forecasts 
they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability  drilling rig activity  changes in delivery capacity and trends in regional pricing differentials 
future price forecasts from independent third parties are also taken into account in arriving at the company s own pricing estimates 
the company s estimates of future prices are applied to the estimated reserve quantities acquired to arrive at estimated future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues are then discounted to derive a fair value for such reserves 
the fair value of proved reserves is then used to estimate the fair value of proved property costs acquired in a business combination 
the company also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination 
these unproved reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves 
the fair value of probable and possible reserves is then used to estimate the fair value of unproved property costs acquired in a business combination 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are less precise than those of proved reserves 
generally  in the company s business combinations  the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires more judgment than the estimates of fair values for other acquired assets and liabilities 
future development and abandonment costs future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the ultimate settlement amount  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the political  legal  environmental and regulatory environment 
the company reviews its assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of sfas sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
holding all other factors constant  if the company s estimate of future abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates were revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
it would require an increase in the present value of the company s estimated future abandonment cost of approximately million representing an increase of approximately to the company s december  asset retirement obligation to increase the company s dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  recognition of insurance recoveries the company recognizes estimated proceeds from insurance recoveries only when the amount of the recovery is determinable and when the company believes that the proceeds are probable of recovery 
when the amount of the estimated recoveries has been determined and when the company has concluded that the recovery is probable  the recoveries are recognized in the results of operations 
business interruption proceeds are recorded as a reduction of transportation and other expense and property damage recoveries are recorded as a reduction of lease operating expense 
pension and other post retirement benefits accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits involves several assumptions including the expected rates of return on plan assets  determination of discount rates for remeasuring plan obligations  determination of inflation rates regarding compensation levels and health care cost projections 
the company develops its demographics and utilizes the work of actuaries to assist with the measurement of employee related obligations 
the assumptions used vary from year to year  which will affect future results of operations 
any differences among these assumptions and the results actually experienced will also impact future results of operations 
an analysis of the effect of a change in health care cost trends on post retirement benefits is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company generally provides for taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
where the company s present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in its foreign operations  the company does not provide for us income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance the foreign operations of the company 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  commodity pricing and expenditures by tax jurisdiction for the company s operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
management also periodically assesses  by tax jurisdiction  the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the assessments are subject to revision in the future 
other matters inflation 
publicly held companies are asked to comment on the effects of inflation on their business 
as of february   annual inflation in terms of the decrease in the general purchasing power of the dollar is running well below the general annual inflation rates experienced in the past 
while the company  like other companies  continues to be affected by fluctuations in the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation  such effect is not considered significant as of february  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
in the past  the company has made limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
see business competition and market conditions 
interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
as of february   the company has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  thereafter total fair value long term debt variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk in addition to the us dollar  the company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct a substantial portion of their business in canadian dollars and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions conducted in canada 
as of february   the company is not a party to any foreign currency exchange agreement 
current hedging activity as of december   the company held various derivative instruments 
the company has entered into natural gas and crude oil option agreements referred to as collars 
collars are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
the company has designated a significant portion of these contracts as cash flow hedges designed to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to price volatility 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of derivatives also involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
currently  the company does not expect losses due to creditworthiness of its counterparties 
the gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
the oil derivative transactions are generally settled based on the average of the reporting settlement prices for west texas intermediate on the nymex for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the company if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction  and the company is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such transaction 
the estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  volatility and the time value of options 
further details related to the company s hedging activities as of december  are as follows contract period and nymex contract price fair value of type of contract volume floor ceiling liability natural gas contracts mmbtu a collar contracts january december january december january december january december january december january december january december january december january december january december january december crude oil contracts barrels collar contracts january december january december january december january december january december january december january december january december a mmbtu means million british thermal units 
although all of the company s collars are effective as economic hedges  the forecasted shut in hydrocarbon production from the company s gulf of mexico properties resulting primarily from hurricane activity during the third quarter of caused certain of the gas and crude oil collar contracts to lose their qualification for hedge accounting under sfas as a result  the company reclassified million of previously deferred losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to commodity derivative expense in the income statement during the third quarter of additionally  the company now recognizes all future changes in the fair value of these collar contracts in the consolidated statement of income for the period in which the change occurs under the caption commodity derivative expense 
as of december   the company had the following collar contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting contract period and nymex contract price fair value of type of contract volume floor ceiling liability natural gas contracts mmbtu collar contracts january november
