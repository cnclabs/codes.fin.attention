overview we have water transmission manufacturing facilities in portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto  california  parkersburg  west virginia  and saginaw  texas 
we have tubular products manufacturing facilities in portland  oregon  atchison  kansas  houston  texas  and bossier city  louisiana 
our fabricated products manufacturing facility is located in monterrey  mexico 
we believe the tubular products business and fabricated products business  in conjunction with the water transmission business  provide a significant degree of market diversification  because the principal factors affecting demand for water transmission products are different from those affecting demand for tubular products or fabricated products 
demand for water transmission products is generally based on population growth and movement  changing water sources and replacement of aging infrastructure 
demand can vary dramatically within our market area since each population center determines its own waterworks requirements 
demand for tubular products is influenced by construction activity and general economic conditions 
demand for fabricated products is influenced by weather patterns and residential heating needs  construction activity  and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranties  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission segment is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs of each contract 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all projects that are fifty percent or more complete except that major projects  usually over million  are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by greater than one percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue from our tubular products and fabricated products segments is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and from contract disputes 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit rating reports or financial information of a potential customer 
trade receivable balances are evaluated at least monthly 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us as a result of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s financial position  contract dispute  product claim or other similar events  a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the expected recovery amount given all information presently available 
a general allowance is recorded for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   the accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  we believe the reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded  which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we review for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit that includes goodwill  as measured by discounted cash flows  market multiples based on earnings  and other valuation methodologies  to the carrying value 
as required under sfas  we performed our annual assessment for impairment of the goodwill as of december   based on our analysis  we believe no impairment of goodwill exists 
long lived assets property and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
we assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverable value of long lived assets is determined by estimating future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about the expected future operating performance of the company 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
if we determine the carrying value of the property and equipment will not be recoverable  we calculate and record an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
finished goods are stated at standard cost  which approximates the first in  first out method of accounting 
raw material inventories of steel coil are stated at cost on a specific identification basis or at standard cost 
raw material inventories of coating and lining materials  as well as materials and supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 
product warranties our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for our products to be free of certain defects 
we record a general reserve for warranty claims based on historical experience 
if actual warranty claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the reserve would be necessary 
income taxes we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims at our west virginia facility 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent practical  the aggregate exposure to claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
pension benefits we have two defined benefit pension plans that are frozen 
we fund these plans to cover current plan costs plus amortization of the unfunded plan liabilities 
to record these obligations  management uses estimates relating to assumed inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  and discount rates 
management  along with third party actuaries  reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments 
year ended december  net sales water transmission tubular products fabricated products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales water transmission tubular products fabricated products year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased over the same period last year as a result of increased volume  which is attributable to stronger demand 
our water transmission business is impacted by infrastructure improvements  as municipal water agencies initiate improvements  we generally experience an increase in demand for our products 
in addition to increased sales  the stronger demand resulted in a consistently strong backlog at december  of  as compared to the backlog of million at the beginning of bidding activity  backlog and sales resulting from the award of new projects  or the production of current projects  may vary significantly from period to period 
tubular products sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net sales over the same period was expected  as the market conditions experienced in could not be sustained 
volume decreased in as we focused our efforts on products we believe offer the opportunity for sustainable profitability  and do not directly compete with low cost imports 
fabricated products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales is attributable to improved demand  which allowed for an increase in sales prices  and a small increase in market share 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our water transmission gross profit improved as our production continued to be strong throughout the year  and we were able to take advantage of consistent higher plant utilization 
gross profit from tubular products decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our tubular products gross margin percentage decreased from the same period last year primarily because  as selling prices stabilized  our cost of goods sold increased because of high cost steel  which reduced our margin 
fabricated products gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from  of segment net sales in fabricated products gross profit increased over the same period last year due to increased volume combined with better productivity in our operations  and higher selling prices during as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in while the increase is consistent with the increase in sales  specific factors affecting the increase in expenses include an increase in incentive compensation  and an increase in information systems costs due to our recently completed system upgrade 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in both our outstanding borrowings and the rates on those borrowings 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to changes in section manufacturing deductions  changes in state apportionment factors  and the resolution of previously uncertain tax matters 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased as a result of increased volume  which was attributable to stronger demand 
our water transmission business is impacted by infrastructure improvements  as municipal water agencies initiate improvements  we generally experience an increase in demand for our products 
in addition to increased sales  the stronger demand resulted in an improved backlog at december  of  as compared to the backlog of million at the beginning of tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales resulted primarily from our ability to pass on steel price increases to our customers 
during  we raised prices on our tubular products in order to pass along to our customers the steel surcharges and base price increases our steel vendors had included on steel purchased by us 
these price increases were designed to absorb the increase in the cost of steel  our principal raw material 
fabricated products sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was attributable to increased demand 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in our water transmission projects are obtained primarily through competitive bidding  which often occurs three to six months in advance of production of the projects 
at the time of the bidding  we attempt to accurately estimate the future price of steel that will be purchased for the project and include that in our bid 
our water transmission gross margin percentage decreased primarily because we experienced significant increases in the price per ton and the surcharges on steel  which comprises the majority of our cost of goods sold 
as this significant component of our cost of sales increases  our gross margin percentage is necessarily driven down  even if all steel cost increases are passed along to our customers 
to some extent  our water transmission gross profit also decreased because we did not fully anticipate nor include in our project bidding the full amount of the increase in the cost of steel early in gross profit from tubular products increased significantly to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in tubular products gross profit increased primarily as a result of the elimination of sales of low margin products and the sale of generally lower costing inventory at higher selling prices charged by the company in response to increasing steel costs 
fabricated products gross profit increased to  of segment net sales in from  of segment net sales in fabricated products gross profit increased primarily from improved efficiencies in our production facilities  as a result of the increased volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in incentive compensation and professional fees incurred to meet sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in both our outstanding borrowings and the rates on those borrowings 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in and in liquidity and capital resources we generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and available borrowings of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of our net income of million  non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  and a decrease in inventories of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in trade and other receivables  net of million 
the decrease in inventories and accounts payable resulted primarily from a decrease in steel shipments from our vendors at the end of as compared to the increase in trade and other receivables  net resulted from an increase in our shipments to customers to meet their installation schedules 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which primarily related to additions of property and equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to be between and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which resulted from proceeds received from a sale leaseback transaction of million  and from net borrowings under our credit agreement of million  offset in part by net payments of million on our long term debt agreements 
we had the following significant components of debt at december  a million credit agreement  under which million was outstanding  million of series b senior notes  million of senior notes  million of series a term note  million of series b term notes  million of series c term notes  and million of series d term notes 
the credit agreement expires on may  the balance outstanding under the credit agreement bears interest at rates related to libor plus to  or the lending institution s prime rate  minus to 
we had million outstanding under the line of credit bearing interest at a weighted average rate of  partially offset by million in cash receipts that had not been applied to the loan balance 
at december  we had an additional net borrowing capacity under the line of credit of million 
the series a term note in the principal amount of million matures on february  and requires annual payments in the amount of million that begin february  plus interest of paid quarterly on february  may  august and november the series b term notes in the principal amount of million mature on june  and require annual payments in the amount of million that begin june  plus interest of paid quarterly on march  june  september and december the series c term notes in the principal amount of million mature on october  and require annual payments of million that begin october  plus interest of paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the series d term notes in the principal amount of million mature on january  and require annual payments in the amount of  that begin january  plus interest of paid quarterly on january  april  july  and october the series b senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on april  and require annual payments of million that began april  plus interest at paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on november  and require annual payments in the amount of million that began november  plus interest of paid quarterly on february  may  august  and november the senior notes and series b senior notes together  the notes also include supplemental interest from to at december   based on our total minimum net earnings before tax plus interest expense net of capitalized interest expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense ebitda to total debt leverage ratio  which is paid with the required quarterly interest payments 
the notes  the series a term note  the series b term notes  the series c term notes  and the series d term notes together  the term notes and the credit agreement are collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and certain equipment 
we lease certain equipment used in the manufacturing process 
the aggregated interest rate on the capital leases is 
we have operating leases with respect to certain manufacturing equipment that require us to pay property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
under the terms of certain operating leases  we sold equipment to an unrelated third party the lessor who then leased the equipment to us 
these leases  along with other debt instruments already in place  and our credit agreement  best met our near term financing and operating capital requirements compared to other available options at the time they were entered into 
certain of our operating lease agreements include renewals and or purchase options set to expire at various dates 
if we choose to elect the purchase options on leases scheduled to expire during  we will be required to make payments of million 
in addition  certain of our operating lease agreements  primarily manufacturing equipment leases  with terms of years  contain provisions related to residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased equipment from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the equipment and an agreed value 
the maximum potential liability to us under such guarantees is million at december  if the proceeds from the sale of terminating equipment leases are zero 
consistent with past experience  management does not expect any payments will be required pursuant to these guarantees  and no amounts have been accrued at december  the following table sets forth our commitments under the terms of our debt obligations and operating leases total thereafter credit agreement the notes the term notes capital leases operating leases interest payments total obligations these amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations  excluding the credit agreement 
we also have entered into stand by letters of credit that total approximately million as of december  the stand by letters of credit relate to workers compensation  and general liability insurance 
due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience  we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements 
therefore  they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above 
the credit agreement  the notes  the term notes and operating leases all require compliance with the following financial covenants minimum consolidated tangible net worth  maximum consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio 
these and other covenants included in our financing agreements impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations  and place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances on assets and capital expenditures 
a failure by us to comply with the requirements of these covenants  if not waived or cured  could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
at december   we were not in violation of any of the covenants in our debt agreements 
we expect to continue to rely on cash generated from operations and other sources of available funds to make required principal payments under the notes during we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by operations and the sale of our riverside facility  and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent necessary  we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings  senior notes  term notes and capital and operating leases  if such resources are available on satisfactory terms 
we have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements other than non cancelable operating lease commitments  we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
related party transactions 
we have ongoing business relationships with certain affiliates of wells fargo company wells fargo 
wells fargo  together with certain of its affiliates  owns more than ten percent of our outstanding stock 
during the year ended december   we made the following payments to affiliates of wells fargo i capital and operating lease payments pursuant to which the company leases certain equipment from such affiliates  ii payments of interest and fees pursuant to letters of credit originated by such affiliates  iii payments of principal and interest on an industrial development bond  and iv payments of principal  interest and related fees in connection with loan agreements between the company and such affiliates 
payments made by us to wells fargo and its affiliates amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
balances due to wells fargo and its affiliates were and million at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations or financial position  but do not expect sfas to have a material effect 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph l b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas r commencing with the quarter ending march  we estimate the impact of adoption of sfas r will approximate the impact of the adjustments made to determine pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share under sfas  as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no

 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we use derivative financial instruments from time to time to reduce exposure associated with potential foreign currency rate changes occurring between the contract date and when the payments are received 
these instruments are not used for trading or for speculative purposes 
the company has entered into foreign exchange agreements agreements for million 
the agreements guarantee that the exchange rate does not go below the rate used in the contract bid amount and the amount ultimately collected 
as of december   million was still open and the agreements were expected to be completed by june  we believe risk exposure resulting from exchange rate movements to be immaterial 
we are exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to certain portions of our debt 
the debt subject to changes in interest rates is our million revolving credit line million outstanding as of december  
management believes our current risk exposure to interest rate movements to be immaterial
