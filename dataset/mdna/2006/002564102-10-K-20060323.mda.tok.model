item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the company is a supplier of mainly safety related products and tools to workers involved in the construction  manufacturing and homeland security markets 
from seven fully stocked distribution facilities sales offices in the western and southwestern part of the united states  and one temporary facility in louisiana to serve our customers helping with the aftermath of the hurricanes affecting the gulf coast region  the company primarily distributes equipment and commodity products to the local geographic areas surrounding its facilities 
iesi  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  imports disposable clothing from china 
iesi sells their product throughout the united states and the caribbean through the abatix distribution channels  as well as through other distributors 
the company s management believes that hiring additional sales staff  controlling costs  geographic expansion  diversification of customer base and responding effectively to competitive challenges are important to the long term success of the company 
sales staff we sell our products based on relationships  among other things 
our ability to hire  train and retain staff  especially in the sales and customer service area is critical to our long term success 
competitive compensation and benefits as well as a good work life balance are critical to this area 
controlling costs to maintain our competitive position by providing competitively priced products while also maintaining our profitability  we must control our costs and effectively utilize our assets 
we continuously review our general and administrative costs making adjustments where appropriate 
our ability to control costs can be affected by outside factors  such as the price of oil or other raw materials or increases in interest rates 
in addition  the cost to initially comply with section of sox is expected to total approximately  by december  this cost will negate much of our cost reduction efforts to date 
geographic expansion the company needs to leverage our infrastructure and knowledge over a larger revenue base 
while the company intends to focus on growing revenues in its existing locations  the company will also explore geographic expansion 
this expansion could come in the form of opening a new location in a new geographic market or acquiring an existing company in a market where we currently do not operate 
these possibilities require significant planning time and financial resources which could limit our ability to implement 
customer base while no customer represents or more of the company s revenues  there are several large customers  especially at iesi 
the loss of one or more of those customers would have an impact on our revenue and profitability 
the company intends to pursue additional customers in an attempt to lessen the impact of any one customer and improve on existing customer relationships 
while we intend to market our customer service in an attempt to obtain higher margins  obtaining market share generally has a negative effect on product margins 
competitive environment past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our products in all of our markets 
our competition ranges from small owner operator distributors to large national retail chains selling to the construction industry and large national companies selling to the construction and industrial industries 
typically  the smaller companies are built around very strong relationships which make it hard to penetrate  while the larger companies have a distinct geographic and price advantage 
in addition to the above mentioned critical success factors  the company needs to improve how it responds to catastrophic events like the hurricanes of and significant  short term boosts of revenue  while positively impacting the sales and net income lines of the income statement are very difficult for the company to handle for the following reasons non recurring revenues o comparisons of financial results between periods are not always evident without reading the financial statements as a whole 
o there is no reliable method to determine the amount of impact these events will have on the company  nor is there a reliable method to determine how long the impact may last 
accounts receivable o the sharp rise in non recurring revenues from these events can cause significant balances owed to the company by a few customers 
balancing this concentration risk with sales is a difficult process that involves significant judgment 
o much of the work performed by the company s customers is related to insurance claims 
occasionally  there is difficulty in getting the insurance company to pay the amount owed and can possibly delay when abatix is paid 
inventory o certain products can be in short supply because the company s vendors are unable to ramp up production to meet the demand in the required time frame 
o damage caused by catastrophic events can affect the manufacturing and transportation of inventory  including raw materials used by others to manufacture products sold by the company 
o products in demand in the affected areas can decimate inventory levels in other facilities and not allow us to serve all of our customers in a normal manner 
o potential shortages in product lead to advance purchasing and maintaining higher levels of safety stock 
if there is little or no damage caused by a catastrophic event or if advance purchasing is too aggressive in estimated needs  the company could be left with excess inventory 
cash o significant increases in revenues in a short period of time utilize the cash resources available to the company as the inventory is purchased and paid for generally between days  while the average collection period is generally more than days 
o advance purchases in anticipation of increased sales and possible shortages in supply elongates the cash cycle 
o as interest rates continue to rise  the higher borrowing levels normally associated with these events translate to higher interest expense 
human resources o there is significant planning time involved in responding to these events that would normally be spent on other areas of the business 
o immediate response to these disasters is handled by currently employed personnel which can detract from the service levels provided to our customer base in our other facilities 
o we have generally found a lack of human resource talent outside of the company to meet the short term needs demanded by our temporary facilities 
o significant amounts of time are spent managing and projecting the cash flows to ensure cash resources are available 
o fluctuations in financial results can result in extra requirements placed on the corporate staff as a result of comments  inquiries and compliance with regulatory agencies 
other than historical and factual statements  the matters and items discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results of the company may differ materially from the results discussed herein 
certain  but not all  factors that could contribute to such differences are discussed throughout this report 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by law or regulation

liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations during of  compared to cash used in operations during of  accounts receivable o gross accounts receivable increased since june  and since year end as sales in the third and fourth quarters of were higher than normal 
o a significant portion  approximately  of the receivables balance is held by ten companies  with the largest company comprising approximately of the receivables balance 
while these companies are long term customers of abatix and payment in full is expected  non payment or delays in payment of these balances owed would have a significant negative impact on the cash flows of the company 
gross inventory increased since june  and since year end 
this increase is a result of o an increase in stocking levels ahead of price increases on several products  and o inventory held in louisiana in anticipation of further hurricane related work to be done in the gulf coast region 
these uses of cash were mostly offset by the o net earnings  o increase in accrued expenses  and o non cash charges to earnings 
cash requirements for investing activities during of  increased by  when compared to these requirements were primarily the purchase of corporate and delivery vehicles  computer hardware and software  new furniture and warehouse equipment related to the move of a branch into a new facility and necessary items to make our temporary facility in louisiana operational

the company has a  working capital line of credit with its financial institution and a  capital equipment credit facility 
based on the borrowing formula calculated as of february   the company had the capacity to borrow up to a maximum of  on its working capital line 
as of march   there are advances of  outstanding on the working capital credit facility 
as of march  there are advances of  outstanding on the capital equipment credit facility 
both credit facilities expire in october and bear a variable rate of interest tied to the prime rate 
although  the company  at its option  can convert the loan to a libor rate loan 
the equipment facility is payable on demand 
the majority of the company s credit facilities are at one financial institution 
there is risk associated with having the majority of the company s relationship with one financial institution 
contractual obligations the following table presents the company s total contractual obligations as of december  for which cash flows are fixed or determinable in thousands 
total contractual obligations operating leases working capital line of credit equipment notes employment contracts open purchase orders office equipment leases total contractual obligations commentary even though the company s working capital line of credit agreement has a maturity date of october  there is no defined payment schedule 
therefore  this line of credit is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the above amount does not include a contractual obligation related to the interest since the interest rate is variable and the working capital line of credit balance fluctuates  therefore making the interest component not fixed and determinable 
the company s equipment notes are comprised of term notes of to months in length 
certain of these term notes also have a call feature  and are therefore classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the other term notes with no call feature are properly classified between the current liabilities and non current liabilities sections on the consolidated balance sheets 
the employment agreements with the chief executive  operating and financial officers were effective on january  and expire on december  the open purchase orders represent amounts the company anticipates will become payable within the next year for saleable product 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used 
the critical judgments by management relate to allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory  depreciation  amortization and impairment testing for property and equipment  deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments  and retained insurance risks 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has estimated the net realizable value of accounts receivable by evaluating the current pool of accounts receivable in light of past experience and current knowledge of its customer base 
the company believes the reserves recorded in the financial statements are adequate for potential credit losses 
it is possible the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time or if the health of the economy  its customers or the markets served by the company deteriorates 
excess and obsolete inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the financial statements 
depreciation  amortization and impairment testing for property and equipment estimating the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment  and actual lives may differ from these estimates 
changes to these initial useful life estimates would be made if and when appropriate 
property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines and facilities  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the use of long lived assets in assessing potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
since there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate the carrying value of long lived assets were impaired  the company recorded no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets 
the company does not expect events or circumstances to significantly change  thereby affecting the carrying value of long lived assets 
deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments as of december   the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset 
in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets  if any  the company considers many factors  including the specific taxing jurisdiction  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  the company concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company records liabilities in current income taxes for potential assessments resulting from tax audits 
any accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in  potentially  a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the ultimate resolution of these positions 
these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws  rulings by tax authorities  or the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the company s us federal income tax returns have been audited through and all federal assessments of additional taxes  interest and penalties have been paid through retained insurable risks the company has elected to self insure for health care related costs  but does have catastrophic coverage 
the accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events are based upon historical loss patterns and management s judgment 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb posted the final fasb staff position fsp no 
sop  terms of loan products that may give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
this fsp defines loan products that may give rise to concentrations of credit risk as being loan products whose contractual features may increase the exposure of the originator  holder  investor  guarantor  or service to risk of nonpayment or realization 
the company does not expect any impact to its financial statements from this fsp 
on january   the fasb issued an exposure draft  the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
this exposure draft would provide companies with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
this proposed standard seeks to reduce both complexity in accounting and volatility in earnings caused by differences in the existing accounting rules 
the company does not expect any impact to its financial statements from this exposure draft  if adopted in its current state 
on february   the fasb posted the final fsp no 
fas r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event

business outlook our goal for is to produce revenue growth  exclusive of the non recurring revenues in louisiana in  as it is vital to our long term success 
we are anticipating the industrial manufacturing and construction markets to remain steady or improve slightly as the general economy and  in particular  the real estate market  have stabilized 
however  recent increases in interest rates and the cost of materials for real estate projects could negatively impact those segments and the economy in general 
we anticipate growth in the environmental market  and in particular  the restoration subset of that market 
however  year over year growth in will be difficult because of the positive impact on our business  estimated at approximately  from the hurricanes in we do not expect much growth in the homeland security market 
however  we will continue to seek both public and private sector opportunities 
continued shortages in supplies of product  in particular the equipment necessary to respond to catastrophic events and plastic sheeting and bags used in environmental cleanup  could impact the company s ability to serve the customers 
in addition  i price increases attributable to increased raw materials cost  ii decrease in supply of product caused by damage from the weather events or iii increases in demand for product caused by the weather events could cause increases in product costs which could impact sales 
hiring of additional sales staff will be critical for long term growth of the company 
diversification of our customer base  especially at the iesi segment  will also help provide more consistent results 
although no customer is more than of our revenues  we have several large customers  the loss of which would impact our sales and profitability 
the growth at the iesi segment was primarily generated by two customers 
we are focused on helping all of our customers grow  as well as adding to our customer base 
new locations and acquisitions will most likely be critical for the long term growth of the company 
although we are not certain if and when we will open new locations  we are currently evaluating certain markets as possibilities 
we are not currently evaluating any acquisitions 
overall margins for are anticipated to be in the range 
we are utilizing certain tools and reporting from our new computer system in an effort to enhance margins 
in addition  these tools and reporting should allow us to identify issues that can be addressed more quickly  thereby minimizing possible margin erosion 
we continue to evaluate the consolidation of certain vendors to gain access to better pricing 
alternative methods for sourcing products are also being evaluated to enhance our purchasing process 
however  further competitive pressures or changes in the customer or product mix could negatively impact any and all efforts by the company to maintain or improve product margins 
the company will need to further reduce costs to stay competitive and improve on its profitability 
we intend to continue evaluating costs  including labor related costs  rent and freight which make up approximately of our selling  general and administrative costs  to ensure our cost structure is in line with our revenue stream and supports our business model 
in  the company began its work to comply with sox the company currently estimates that it will incur in excess of  in costs  most of which are external costs  related to this work 
as was the case in florida in february  if the revenue stream for the temporary office in ponchatoula does not support the continued operation of that facility  we are prepared to close it 
depending on the timing  a decision to close the facility could result in a charge to earnings 
unless revenues improve significantly and are sustainable  s  g a expenses are estimated to be in the range for the company s credit facilities are variable rate notes tied to the lending institution s prime or libor rates 
increases in these rates have already and could continue to negatively affect the company s earnings 
depending on many factors  including the timing of sales  cash flow from operations for the entire year of is expected to be positive as the company collects the receivables from the sales increase in the last half of  improvements are made to inventory and purchasing and there is further refinement in our cost structure 
unless the company employs a more aggressive growth strategy  management believes the company s current credit facilities  together with cash provided by operations  will be sufficient for its capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
the company s accounts receivable collection days have improved slightly over the past twelve months after increasing slightly in the previous year 
the company believes its allowance for bad debts is sufficient to cover any anticipated losses 
the company s inventory turns have declined slightly over the past twelve months after improving in the previous year 
the decline is primarily a result of the inventory levels in anticipation of continued sales in the areas impacted by the hurricanes in continued work in reducing inventory levels is still needed  however  the company believes its allowance for inventory obsolescence is sufficient to cover any lower of cost or market issues 
a new location would require approximately  in fixed asset purchases  comprised of computers  office furniture  warehouse racking and potentially a delivery vehicle 
in addition  cash will also be required to stock this location with product and to finance the customers purchases 
cash flow from operations and borrowings on our lines of credit would most likely be used to finance any new location 
unless the company s stock could be used as currency  any acquisitions would most likely require the raising of capital as the borrowing capacity on the lines of credit and the cash flow from operations would most likely not be sufficient to support an acquisition of reasonable size 
the company currently estimates that it will incur approximately  in additional costs through related to the implementation of sox information concerning forward looking statements certain statements contained herein  among other things  are of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future business performance of abatix 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the occurrence  timing and property devastation of disasters  global  national and local economic and political conditions  changes in laws and regulations relating to the company s products and the import of such products  market acceptance of new products  existence or development of competitive products the company represents that outperform current product lines or are priced more competitively  inability to hire and train quality people or retain current employees  changes in interest rates  the financial status of and relationships with key customers and vendors  efforts to control and or reduce costs  fluctuations in oil prices  or the company s success in the process of management s assessment and auditor attestation of internal controls  as required by the sox we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by law or regulation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s working capital and equipment lines of credit are variable rate notes  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s debt at december  and  an increase of basis points in the united states prime rate would have negatively impacted the company s net earnings for the years then ended by  and  respectively
