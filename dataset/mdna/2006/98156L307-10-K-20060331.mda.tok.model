results of operations general our itv business has historically accounted for substantially all of our revenue 
in the third quarter of  we completed a sale of significant assets  including our itv intellectual property rights and our membership interest in tvgateway  llc 
this transaction marked a shift in our business away from the itv business and toward a new video phone product and related business 
although we continued to support our remaining itv business into the first quarter of  the development of our video phone product became a primary business focus 
our video phone business has not produced significant revenues to date 
the extent and timing of future revenues for our business depends on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our products and the degree of competition from similar products 
we cannot predict to what extent our video phone product will produce revenues  or when  or if  we will reach profitability 
on april   we entered into a multi year agreement with general instrument corporation d b a the connected home solutions business of motorola  inc general instrument for the worldwide development and distribution of the ojo personal video phone 
this agreement provided for general instrument to be worldgate s exclusive distributor of its broadband video phone products and for worldgate to be general instrument s exclusive supplier of its broadband video phone products 
on february   we mutually agreed with general instrument to end this agreement 
the ending of this agreement immediately terminates exclusivity for both parties 
in addition to its current role for development and manufacture of ojo  worldgate will now have direct responsibility and control for the advertising  marketing  and distribution of its products 
under our development and distribution agreement with general instrument  general instrument was responsible for the distribution of our products and for the direct relationship with the distributors  dealers  and other resellers ultimately used to sell the products 
in addition  general instrument marketed our products and maintained an inventory of our products 
in performing these functions general instrument carried the associated risks  costs and expenses 
as a result of ending our agreement with general instrument  we are now directly assuming these responsibilities and the associated risks  costs and expenses  and this places increased demands on the cash which we have available 
although general instrument s price of our product to its reseller customers included a mark up from its cost of the product from us that was intended to reflect its risks  cost and expenses  plus its profit  we will be charging these reseller customers a lower price and we cannot be assured that the new price will include a sufficient mark up to cover the risks  costs and expenses that is now our responsibility going forward 
under its agreement with general instrument  worldgate had been active in marketing and promoting its products  and working with general instrument to distribute ojo 
worldgate intends to continue the rollout of ojo using many of the same distributors  retailers and service providers and plans to expand distribution to service providers and retailers around the world 
the company and general instrument will work together to ensure a smooth transition for existing customer accounts 
in addition to direct sales on our web site  we will continue to rely upon a distribution organization of dealers  distributors  original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers  service providers and other resellers to market and sell our video phone products  many of which will be the same as those used by general instrument 
to enable our own retail distribution efforts we have hired an experienced retail consumer electronics executive to direct our efforts in this area 
to create retail and consumer interest and build demand for the product  the company plans to lower the wholesale and suggested manufacturer suggested retail prices 
in addition  the company will offer time limited rebates to further spur interest and sales 
under its agreement with general instrument  worldgate s video phone products were required to be co branded with the ojo brand which worldgate continued to own and the motorola brand 
as the result of ending our agreement with general instrument  we will now be dropping the motorola brand 
general instrument also maintained the necessary infrastructure to handle distribution logistics  including customer ordering  inventory warehousing  billing  customer service  credit and accounts receivable functions multiple customers 
all of our revenue for the sale of our video phones was derived from general instrument  a single customer  and there were minimal administrative costs associated with billing and collecting this revenue 
the company will now have multiple customers and bear the associated increased administrative costs and risks of collection 
worldgate will also need to develop the necessary infrastructure to handle multiple customers and these other logistical functions 
as part of ending our agreement with general instrument  and in anticipation of worldgate inventory requirements as a result of taking full responsibility for product distribution  worldgate negotiated the right to buy back about two thirds of the units sold to general instrument  valued at approximately  based upon the original sales price to general instrument  for approximately  this is less than half of what it would cost the company to purchase the same inventory from its manufacturing sources 
for more details  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and the delivery and acceptance of the equipment has occurred or services have been rendered 
management exercises judgment in evaluating these factors in light of the terms and conditions of its customer contracts and other existing facts and circumstances to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
due to our limited commercial sales history  our ability to evaluate the collectibility of customer accounts requires significant judgment 
the company evaluates its equipment customer and service customer accounts for collectibility at the date of sale and on an ongoing basis 
until mid february  the company had only one customer for the purchase of its product and the agreement with this customer included several elements relevant to revenue recognition including a the customer had no general right to return the product  b the customer earned warrants upon the purchase of significant video telephony units and the value of these warrants would result in a reduction of recognized revenue the value of these warrants has been routinely monitored by the company and is currently deemed to be insignificant  however  should the value of these warrants become material an offset would be made against revenues  c penalties were payable to the customer if certain excessive field failure rates were exceeded  d the company and the customer shared in the benefit achieved by product cost reductions  e penalties were payable to the customer if the company failed to deliver shipments on a timely basis  f the company extended to the customer a limited product warranty for a term not to exceed three years the company maintains a warranty reserve based upon the percentage of product sales consistent with industry comparable failure rates and the warranty period provided by the agreement 
beginning in mid february  the company began selling its products to multiple customers and some of the above factors may change and need to be re evaluated 
revenues are also offset with a reserve for any price refunds and consumer rebates consistent with the emerging task force eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
as an incentive to promote delivery of the units  a special product launch discount was provided by the company to its sole customer as a quantity restricted reduction to the unit contract based price in effect 
for the twelve months ended december   this discount was in addition  the company offered a forward pricing program to this customer and a rebate program to consumers  as further incentives for the holiday season 
these incentive programs begin in the fourth quarter of and terminated during the first quarter of consistent with the eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  the company has offset the december  revenue by with a reserve for the total estimated liability for the forward pricing program 
the liability associated with the rebate   has been recorded in the twelve months ending december  the total of the product launch discount  rebate and refunds for the twelve months ended december  was as part of ending our agreement with general instrument  and in anticipation of our inventory requirements as a result of taking full responsibility for product distribution  we negotiated the right to buy back about two thirds of the units sold to general instrument  valued at approximately  based upon the original sales price to general instrument  for approximately  this is less than half of what it would cost us to purchase the same inventory from our manufacturing sources 
as a result we recorded a reserve for returns and reduced revenue in the amount of approximately  during the fourth quarter of in addition we will record no revenue for units shipped to general instrument in the first quarter and will record a gain on termination of this agreement of approximately  during the first quarter as a result of the lower purchase price of this inventory net of the cost of rework for rebranding the product 
inventories 
our inventory consists primarily of finished goods equipment 
the cost is determined on an average cost basis 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
factors related to current inventories such as technological obsolescence and market conditions are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have an impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
our inventory balance as of december  was  and related solely to our video phone business 
this balance includes  of inventory related to the accounting for product purchased in connection with the ending of the general instrument agreement which is being recorded as a reserve for returns 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined by using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
measurement of the impairment  if any  will be based upon the difference between carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
if useful life estimates or anticipated cash flows change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of  as of december   due to our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty as to the reliability of the asset 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in a benefit from income tax in the consolidated statement of operations

this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
beginning with our interim period that begins on january   we will be required to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
we have elected to utilize the modified prospective transitional method in accounting for share based employee payment transactions 
accounting for preferred shares 
the company accounts for preferred stock in accordance with eitf topic d classification and measurement of redeemable securities  and the redeemable preferred stock was recorded in the financial statements as temporary equity 
additionally  the fair value of warrants and preferred stock conversion options were recorded into the consolidated financial statements as liabilities as a result of their features that require accounting under fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at each reporting balance sheet date  an evaluation is made of these valuations and marked to market 
restatement of the financial statements 
the company has restated its financial statements for the year ended december  to include certain clarifications made in response to the sec s review of the company s registration statement on form sb registration no 
 and annual report on form k for the year ended december  these restatements include expanded explanations in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the company s accounting method and policy for redeemable preferred stock and warrants issued by the company in a private placement in june in addition  the company has restated its financial statements for the years ended december  and to amend and restate the accounting for the warrants and additional investments rights issued in private placements of the company s common stock during the fourth quarter of  and the first and fourth quarters of these security components were originally treated as non cash expenses and with this restatement are being restated as equity transactions

for more details  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we expect  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including among others  assumptions regarding our short term cash requirements and our projected revenue growth that we have sufficient cash on hand to meet our obligations into the fourth quarter of our ability to generate cash is dependant upon the sale of our ojo product and on obtaining cash through capital markets 
we began generating revenue from commercial shipment of our ojo product in april  and we expect revenues to increase as the product continues to roll out to the marketplace 
depending on the ramp up of sales  the increased level of sales activity is projected to have a positive impact on our cash flows from operations  which will support our ability to meet our obligations beyond given that our video phone business involves the development of a new product line with no market penetration  in an underdeveloped market sector  no assurances can be given that sufficient sales  if any  will materialize 
we  however  remain hopeful that sufficient sales will materialize and or that sufficient funding can be developed through ongoing operations or additional financings to continue our operations beyond our long term cash requirement obligations are primarily comprised of the items noted above 
we have no long term debt and our contractual cash requirements and obligations existing beyond the next twelve months are comprised solely of operating lease commitments and redemption of preferred stock  which are not considered material 
we have limited capacity to reduce our workforce and scale back on capital and operational expenditures to decrease our cash usage 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  and we limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were  which were securities having a maturity of less than three months 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  management believes a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the twelve months ended december  would have decreased by approximately this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on our total investments 
foreign currency exchange risk 
although we transact business in various foreign countries  the principal portion of our business is in the united states and substantially all of our revenues and costs to date have been denominated in us dollars 
although our agreement with mototech inc not an affiliate of general instruments or motorola  our contract manufacturer in taiwan  is denominated in us dollars  their material acquisition costs are subject to exchange rate changes that could impact our product costs
