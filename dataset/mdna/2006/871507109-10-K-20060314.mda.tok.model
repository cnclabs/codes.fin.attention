item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read item a 
risk factors found elsewhere in this report 
our actual results may differ materially from those estimated or projected in any of these forward looking statements 
executive overview our company we own and operate a network of surgery centers in states 
as of march   we owned and operated surgery centers and managed nine additional surgery centers 
we own a majority interest in of the surgery centers in which we own an interest  and consolidate of these centers for financial reporting purposes 
however  one of the majority owned and consolidated surgery centers was acquired after december  and one of our newly developed surgery centers began operations after december   therefore  the results of these two surgery centers are not included in our discussion of results 
our surgery centers include three facilities that are licensed as hospitals  two of which we own and one of which we manage 
in addition to our surgery centers  we also operate one diagnostic center and manage three physician networks  including two physician networks in markets in which we operate surgery centers 
much of our growth during occurred through acquisitions and same store growth 
since december   we have acquired six surgery centers and developed one additional surgery center 
of the newly acquired and developed surgery centers  we consolidate and have a majority interest in four of the seven facilities for financial reporting purposes 
we also began the initial development of three additional surgery centers 
we used a mixture of cash from operations and proceeds from our senior credit facility to acquire these interests 
we believe that our continued growth and success depends not only on acquiring surgery centers  but also on the improved performance of facilities that we already own and operate 
our same store facility revenues increased during as a result of increases in the number of cases and a shift to a more favorable payor mix 
however  during the third quarter of  our case volumes in louisiana  texas and north carolina were adversely impacted by several hurricanes 
facilities located in hammond  houma and metairie  louisiana and facilities located in texas and north carolina were temporarily shut down as a result of the hurricanes 
the facilities located in hammond and houma  louisiana and the facilities located in texas and north carolina reopened during the third quarter of and showed improved case volume during the fourth quarter our surgery center located in metairie  louisiana reopened late in the fourth quarter of we estimate that we lost approximately million in revenue during the year ended december   as a result of the closure of the facilities affected by the hurricanes during the third and fourth quarters 
we carry business interruption insurance that may compensate us for our losses related to the closure of facilities because of the hurricanes 
we anticipate acquiring about three to four centers and developing three to four centers annually during the next three to five years 
a typical surgery center costs us between million and million to develop and equip  excluding costs of real estate 
this cost varies depending on the range of specialties that will be provided at the facility and the number of operating and treatment rooms 
we typically fund about of the development costs of a new surgery center with borrowings under our senior credit facility  and the remainder with equity contributed by us and the other owners of the center 
our ownership interests in surgery centers that we have developed range from to  although we anticipate that we will own primarily majority interests in future developments 
the remaining owners are typically local physicians  physician groups or hospitals 
we expect that our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
in addition  the operations of our existing facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
we expect that our capital needs will be financed through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank debt and the issuance of debt and equity securities 

table of contents revenues we generate revenue and cash primarily through patient service revenues 
we also generate revenue and cash  although to a lesser extent  through physician service revenues and other service revenues 
patient service revenues are revenues from surgical or diagnostic procedures performed in each of the surgery centers that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
the fee charged for a procedure varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room  a recovery room  special equipment  supplies  nursing staff and medications 
the fee does not include professional fees charged by the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physician  which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third party payor 
patient service revenues are recognized on the date of service  net of estimated contractual adjustments and discounts for third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
changes in estimated contractual adjustments and discounts are recorded in the period of change 
physician service revenues are revenues from physician networks consisting of reimbursed expenses  plus participation in the excess of revenue over expenses of the physician networks  as provided for in our service agreements with our physician networks 
reimbursed expenses include the costs of personnel  supplies and other expenses incurred to provide the management services to the physician networks 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and in the period in which we have the right to receive a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
physician service revenues are based on net billings with any changes in estimated contractual adjustments reflected in service revenues in the subsequent period 
other service revenues consists of management and administrative service fees derived from the non consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method  management of surgery centers in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets 
the following table summarizes our revenues by service type as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  patient service revenues physician service revenues other service revenues total operating trends we intend to increase revenues by increasing the number of cases performed at each surgery center 
we also intend to increase revenues by acquiring additional surgery centers and developing new surgery centers 
as a result of the increased revenues  we expect our ebitda margin to increase due to operating efficiencies and economies of scale as a result of leveraged general and administrative expenses 
our success in the future will be determined by the continued success of our current surgery centers as well as our ability to acquire and integrate new facilities 
acquisitions  developments and divestitures acquisitions and developments during  we acquired six surgery centers and developed one additional surgery center 
we have a majority interest in and consolidate four of the surgery centers for financial reporting purposes 
we entered into management agreements with each of these centers 
in addition  we began the initial development of three additional surgery centers 
our investment related to these centers was about million we paid for these investments using cash from operations and funds available under our senior credit facility 

table of contents during  we acquired six surgery centers and two other surgery centers we intended to develop through syndication  renovation and expansion 
we also opened one imaging center and entered into a management agreement for one additional surgery center 
we entered into management agreements with each of these centers 
one of our newly developed surgery centers was developed through a partnership with one of our existing physician networks 
our investment related to these centers was about million 
we paid for these investments using cash from operations and funds available under our senior credit facility 
during  we acquired five surgery centers 
we entered into management agreements with each of these surgery centers and have a majority ownership interest in four of these centers 
our investment related to these centers was about million 
we paid for these investments using primarily funds available under our senior credit facility 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in addition  during  we acquired an additional ownership interest in dry creek imaging center  a diagnostic imaging center that is adjacent to our surgery center in the denver  colorado market  for about million in cash 
we now own of the center 
we also acquired an additional ownership interest in village surgicenter in erie  pennsylvania  for about million in cash 
as of december   we own a interest in the center 
divestitures during  the company sold its ownership interest in the erie imaging center  located in erie  pennsylvania  to touchstone medical imaging  llc touchstone for  in cash and a million promissory note payable to the company by touchstone on august  the company received payment in full for the promissory note during the third quarter of the company recorded a loss of approximately  related to the sale 
before the sale  touchstone was the minority partner and manager of the erie imaging center 
also during  the company closed a surgery center located in edmond  oklahoma and sold the surgery center s land and building 
the company evaluated the current market and growth opportunities of the surgery center and decided the best strategy for the company was to close the surgery center 
patient service revenues for the edmond facility were less than of the company s consolidated patient service revenues for each of the twelve months ended december   and in connection with the closure of the surgery center  including the sale of the real estate  the company recorded a net pre tax loss of approximately  during during  after purchasing the outstanding ownership interests from our prior physician and hospital partners  we restructured our physicians surgicenter of houston partnership in houston  texas  creating a joint venture with the american institute of gastric banding  ltd 
a privately held single procedure focused surgical company based in dallas  texas aigb 
in connection with the restructuring  we retained a ownership in the surgery center and we no longer managed or consolidated the surgery center for financial reporting purposes 
during  we sold our remaining ownership in the surgery center to aigb for an immaterial gain 
effective may   the surgery center we managed in knoxville  tennessee closed following the opening of the new surgery center in this market that we developed with the same organization  university health system  inc we have a ownership interest in the new surgery center 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from our current judgments and estimates 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations  and require our management s subjective or complex judgment because of the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates used 
this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
consolidation and control our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries  as well as our interests in facilities that we control through our ownership of a majority voting interest or other rights granted to us by contract as the sole general partner or manager to manage and control the business 
the rights of the limited partners or minority members in these surgery centers are generally limited to those that protect their ownership interests  including the right to approve of the issuance of new ownership interests  and those that protect their financial interests  including the right to approve the acquisition or divestiture of significant assets or the incurrence of debt that physician limited partners or members are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests or that exceeds of the fair market value of the center s assets 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions  including management fees from consolidated centers  are eliminated in consolidation 
we also hold non controlling interests in some surgery centers over which we exercise significant influence 
significant influence includes financial interests ranging from to and duties  rights and responsibilities for the day to day management of the surgery center 
these non controlling interests are accounted for under the equity method 
in addition  on december   as a result of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vies  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin  we consolidated for financial reporting purposes a surgery center in which we do not own an interest 
under fin  the surgery center is considered a vie and we are the primary beneficiary 
therefore  under fin we are required to consolidate this surgery center for financial reporting purposes 
the consolidation of this surgery center does not have a material impact on our results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenues are comprised of patient service revenues  physician service revenues and other service revenues 
our patient service revenues relate to fees charged for surgical or diagnostic procedures performed at facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
these fees are billed either to the patient or a third party payor 
our fees vary depending on the procedure  but usually include all charges for usage of an operating room  a recovery room  equipment  supplies  nursing staff and medications 
our fees do not include professional fees charged by the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physician  which are billed directly by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
we recognize patient service revenues when the related procedures are performed 
our physician service revenues relate to fees we derive from managing physician networks for which we also have a contractual obligation to provide capital and additional assets 
currently we have such an obligation to only one group of six physicians included in one of the three physician networks we manage 
we expect our physician service revenues to decline as a percentage of our total revenues as we continue to focus on our surgery center business 
physician service revenues consist of reimbursed expenses and a percentage of the amount by which each physician network s revenues exceed its expenses  as defined by our management agreement with each physician network 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and the period in which we have rights to a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
our other service revenues are comprised of management and administrative service fees we derive from non consolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method  management of surgery centers in which we do not own an interest and management services we provide to physician networks for which we are not required to provide capital or additional assets 
the fees we derive from these management arrangements are based on a pre 
table of contents determined percentage of the revenues of each surgery center and physician network 
we recognize other service revenues in the period in which services are rendered 
allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts our patient service revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances from third party payors  which we estimate based on the historical trend of our surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  relationships with payors and procedure statistics 
we use established fee schedules  historical payment rates  relationships with payors and procedure statistics to record receivables from third party payors 
while changes in estimated reimbursement from third party payors remain a possibility  we expect that any such changes would be minimal and  therefore  not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
we estimate our allowances for bad debts using similar information and analysis 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debts are adequate  if the actual write offs are significantly different from our estimates  our results of operations may  in turn  be significantly impacted 
because we have the ability to verify a patient s insurance coverage before services are rendered and because we have entered into contracts with third party payors which account for a majority of our total revenue  the out of period contractual adjustments are minimal 
our net accounts receivable reflected allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we derive all of our physician service revenues from physician networks with which we have service agreements 
physician service revenues from physician networks consist of reimbursable expenses plus participation in the excess of revenue over expenses of the physician networks as provided for in the service agreements 
reimbursed expenses include the costs of our personnel  supplies and other expenses incurred to provide the management services to the physician networks 
we recognize physician service revenues in the period in which reimbursable expenses are incurred and in the period in which we have rights to a percentage of the amount by which a physician network s revenues exceed its expenses 
the participation component of physician service revenues is based on net billings of the physician network 
changes in estimated contractual adjustments and bad debts are reflected in physician service revenues in subsequent periods 
our physician service revenues would be impacted by changes in estimated contractual adjustments and bad debts recorded by the physician networks 
the following table summarizes our day s sales outstanding as of the dates indicated as of december  day s sales outstanding our target for day s sales outstanding related to patient service revenues ranges from days to days 
our day s sales outstanding for the dates presented in the table above are within the target range 
our collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor  size of claim and estimated collection percentage for each patient account 
the operating systems used to manage our patient accounts provide for an aging schedule in day increments  by payor  physician and patient 
each surgery center is responsible for 
table of contents analyzing accounts receivable to ensure the proper collection and aged category 
the operating systems generate reports that assist in the collection efforts by prioritizing patient accounts 
collection efforts include direct contact with insurance carriers or patients  written correspondence and the use of legal or collection agency assistance  as required 
at a consolidated level  we review the standard aging schedule  by facility  to determine the appropriate provision for doubtful accounts by monitoring changes in our consolidated accounts receivable by aged schedule  day s sales outstanding and bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
at a consolidated level  we do not review a consolidated aging by payor 
regional and local employees review each surgery center s aged accounts receivable by payor schedule 
these employees have a closer relationship with the payors and have a more thorough understanding of the collection process for that particular surgery center 
furthermore  this review is supported by an analysis of the actual net revenues  contractual adjustments and cash collections received 
if our internal collection efforts are unsuccessful  we manually review patient accounts with balances of or more 
we then classify the accounts based on any external collection efforts we deem appropriate 
an account is written off only after we have pursued collection with legal or collection agency assistance or otherwise deemed an account to be uncollectible 
typically  accounts will be outstanding a minimum of days before being written off 
our accounts receivable aging  net of contractual adjustments but before our allowance for doubtful accounts  for consolidated surgery centers as of december was dollars in thousands amount of total amount of total current to days to days to days to days over days total we recognize that final reimbursement of outstanding accounts receivable is subject to final approval by each third party payor 
however  because we have contracts with our third party payors and we verify the insurance coverage of the patient before services are rendered  the amounts that are pending approval from third party payors are minimal 
amounts are classified outside of self pay if we have an agreement with the third party payor or we have verified a patient s coverage prior to services rendered 
it is our policy to collect co payments and deductibles prior to providing services 
it is also our policy to verify a patient s insurance hours prior to the patient s procedure 
because our services are non emergency  our surgery centers have the ability to control these procedures 
our patient service revenues from self pay as a percentage of total revenues for  and were approximately  and  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if a net operating loss carryforward exists  we make a determination as to whether that net operating loss carryforward will be utilized in the future 
a valuation allowance will be established for certain net operating loss carry forwards where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowances 
long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets when events  circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived assets and the related identifiable intangible assets might be impaired  we assess whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the assessment indicates that the recorded cost will not be recoverable  that cost will be reduced to estimated fair value 
estimated fair value will be determined based on a discounted future cash flow analysis 
during and  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  and  respectively  primarily related to the write down of obsolete medical equipment 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to software that we purchased but no longer intended to use 
we believe that there has been no other impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value method 
impairment is measured at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flows model to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
we will perform a goodwill impairment test whenever events or 
table of contents changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist  or at least annually during the fourth quarter each year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment test and there was no indication of impairment 
professional and general liability risks we are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business  including claims relating to patient treatment  employment practices and personal injuries 
to cover these claims  we maintain general and professional liability insurance in excess of self insured retentions through a third party commercial insurance carrier in amounts we believe to be sufficient for its operations 
we expense the costs under the self insured retention exposure for general and professional liability claims which relate to i deductibles on claims made during the policy period  and ii an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
reserves and provisions for professional liability are based upon actuarially determined estimates 
these estimates are based on various assumptions 
based on historical results and data currently available  we do not believe a change in one or more of these assumptions will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
these balances for professional liability represent the estimated costs of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates 
the reserves are estimated using individual case basis valuations and actuarial analysis 
changes to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results

our cash is used primarily to acquire centers  develop centers and pay operating expenses 
we anticipate acquiring about three to four centers and developing three to four centers annually during the next three to five years 
we expect that our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
in addition  the operations of our existing facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
a typical surgery center costs us between million and million to develop and equip  excluding costs of real estate 
this cost varies depending on the range of specialties that will be provided at the facility and the number of operating and treatment rooms 
we typically fund about of the development costs of a new surgery center with borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash from operations  and the remainder with equity contributed by us and the other owners of the center 
in the past  our ownership interests in surgery centers that we have developed range from to  although we anticipate that we will own primarily majority interests in future developments 
we expect that our capital needs will be financed through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank debt and the issuance of debt and equity securities

long term debt in march  we amended and restated our senior credit facility to allow us to borrow up to million from a group of lenders for acquisitions  developments of new centers and working capital 
the amendment and restatement of the senior credit facility has also lowered our interest costs and extended the maturity date of the senior credit facility until at december   we had outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility of million 
at our option  loans under the senior credit facility bear interest at bank of america s base rate or the eurodollar rate in effect on the applicable borrowing date  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin will vary depending upon the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
as of december   the interest rate for this debt ranged from to per year based on the borrowing date 
during  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the interest rate swap protects us against certain interest rate fluctuations of the libor rate on million of the company s variable rate debt under the senior credit facility

the notes mature in and bear interest at a rate of per year 
the notes contain various covenants to maintain certain financial ratios and also restrict encumbrance of assets  creation of indebtedness  investing activities and payment of distributions 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for the next to months 
we will need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities in the future to fund our acquisitions and development projects 
we cannot assure you that capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we will be required to curtail our acquisition and development program 
our ability to meet our funding needs could be adversely affected if we suffer adverse results from our operations  or if we violate the covenants and restrictions to which we are subject under our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

eitf no 
is effective for all limited partnerships formed after june  and for any limited partnerships in existence on june  that modify their partnership agreements after that date

in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting 
instead  companies will be required to recognize in financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the fair value of those awards 
when sfas no 
r was issued  the effective date was the first reporting period beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission modified the effective date to be the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june   which would be january  for us 
early adoption of sfas no 
r is allowed using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized utilizing sfas no 
r beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted or modified after that date  but is based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
the requirements are the same under the modified retrospective method  but companies are permitted to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  we will use the modified prospective method of adoption and will continue to use the black scholes pricing method to value any future awarded options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our statement of operations 
we currently estimate the impact on our results of operations of adopting sfas no 
r to be approximately million before applying the estimated applicable tax rate 
of the estimated million to be recorded in upon adoption of sfas no 
r  approximately  is expected to be recorded as salaries and benefits and approximately million is expected to be recorded as general and administrative expense 
we are estimating the effect of our 
table of contents stock based compensation for options granted prior to december  will be per diluted share for our estimate can vary in the future depending on many factors  including levels of options and awards granted in the future  forfeitures and when option or award holders exercise these awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in prevailing interest rates 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments other than the use of a variable to fixed interest rate swap for a portion of our senior credit facility 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
our outstanding debt to commercial lenders is generally based on a predetermined percentage above libor or the lenders prime rate 
at december   million of our total long term debt was subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining million of our total long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of  the fair value of our long term debt  based on a discounted cash flow analysis  approximates its carrying value as of december
