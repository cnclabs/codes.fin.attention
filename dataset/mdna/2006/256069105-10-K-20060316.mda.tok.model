item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that we believe are relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item also see item for related financial information 
overview we are one of the largest providers of rural and suburban wireless communications systems in the united states 
we began providing wireless telephone services in in oklahoma and the texas panhandle 
we have expanded our wireless operations with an acquisition strategy targeting underserved rural and suburban areas  which we believe have a significant number of potential customers with substantial needs for wireless communications 
on august   american cellular became our wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  as discussed further in note  business combinations  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in addition  on october   we merged our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  dobson sygnet communications company  sygnet wireless  inc  and sygnet communications  inc with and into our wholly owned subsidiary  dobson cellular 
as a result of these mergers  and the acquisition and restructuring of american cellular  our operations are encompassed in our two primary subsidiaries  dobson cellular and american cellular 
american cellular does not guarantee any debt or other obligations of dobson cellular or us  and dobson cellular and we do not guarantee any debt or other obligations of american cellular 
american cellular is required to file with the sec an annual report on form k for the year ended december  while we provide you with much of american cellular s financial and operational information  we refer you to american cellular s annual report for american cellular s financial and operational results 
management s strategy our business strategy is to attract and retain valuable customers by providing them with a relationship that will be as meaningful to them as it is to us 
we strive to retain this relationship by focusing on the following areas 
providing quality customer service through retail stores  a direct sales force and customer service centers that offer hour services  continuing to evaluate the deployment of new and enhanced products and services on an ongoing basis to provide our customers with access to the best available wireless technology 
some of these new technologies and features include wireless e mail access and internet access  including blackberry handheld devices  dedication to providing the latest technology we believe to be useful  such as gsm gprs edge products 
we believe our gsm gprs edge product offering provides a more attractive value proposition to our subscribers compared to tdma products  offering rate plans with larger home rate areas  lower per minute pricing  more advanced handsets and more extensive data services  and continuing to develop and maintain strategic roaming relationships with other wireless carriers  such as cingular wireless  which allows our subscribers and the subscribers of cingular wireless to roam on each other s networks at favorable rates 
our roaming agreements with cingular wireless designates us as the preferred provider of roaming service in substantially all of our markets where cingular wireless and its affiliates do not have a network  and  under certain circumstances  provide that we are the exclusive provider of such services in our markets 
we believe our roaming relationships allow us to offer our subscribers attractive rate plans that include the footprints of cingular wireless and our other roaming partners as home territories 

table of contents critical accounting policies and practices we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we believe it is necessary for an understanding of our significant accounting policies to read the information below in conjunction with note  significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
these other significant accounting policies are important to develop an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  financial instruments and business combinations require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  it is necessary that we use estimates and assumptions for matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and reasonable assumptions 
our use of estimates and assumptions affects the reported amount of assets  liabilities  and the amount and timing of revenues and expenses we recognize for and during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from estimates 
the estimates and assumptions that are the most difficult to determine and require the most subjective decisions  are described below 
property  plant and equipment and other definite life assets we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our customer lists and certain other identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
these useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
the factors used to determine these estimates include technological advances  obsolescence  expected migration to newer transmission standards and services  regulatory requirements and the churn rate of our customers 
also  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to review the carrying value of our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgment must be exercised in determining when such an event or change in circumstances has occurred 
if such a circumstance were deemed to exist  the carrying value of the asset would be compared to the expected undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset 
we also must use judgment in determining expected future cash flows 
in particular  if customers decreased  our churn rate increased  customer or roaming revenue decreased  or costs to provide service increased  the likelihood of impairment would increase 
customer lists consist of amounts allocated for wireless customer lists as part of an acquisition 
amortization of customer list acquisition costs are based upon our historical and projected lives of our acquired customers 
previously our customer list acquisition costs were being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
based on our most recent analysis of our acquired customers  we began amortizing our customer list over four years beginning in october of this reduction in the remaining useful lives accelerated the amortization of our customer lists resulting in an increase in amortization expense totaling million for  million for and million for as a result of technological advances  which led to our upgrade to gsm gprs edge technology during  we reassessed the useful lives and carrying values of our tdma network assets 
while no impairment was noted  this assessment did result in the reduction of our remaining useful lives for these tdma network assets 
this reduction in the remaining useful lives resulted in an annual increase in depreciation expense totaling million in and continues through goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we continually assess the useful lives of our intangible assets  including goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs 
a significant portion of our intangible assets are classified as wireless license acquisition costs  which represents our costs associated with acquiring our fcc licenses 
these licenses allow us to provide wireless services by giving us the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum 
although the fcc licenses are issued for only a fixed time  generally ten years  these licenses are renewed by the fcc on a routine basis and for a nominal fee 
in addition  we have 
table of contents determined that there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these fcc licenses 
as a result  our wireless license acquisition costs are treated as indefinite life intangible assets 
we test for impairment of goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs at least annually and only adjust the carrying amount of these intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or wireless license acquisition costs 
using judgment  we must also determine on an annual basis whether facts and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life for the wireless license acquisition costs 
to complete this evaluation for our wireless license acquisition costs  we compare the carrying amount of our wireless license acquisition costs to the fair value of those assets 
we determine the fair value of our wireless license acquisition costs based on their expected future discounted cash flows 
the value of the wireless license acquisition costs is based upon a start up basis that separates the value of our customer contracts and other intangible assets from the pure underlying wireless license 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
for purposes of this comparison  it is our policy to aggregate all of our wireless license acquisition costs 
for goodwill  there is a two step approach for assessing impairment 
the first step requires us to compare the fair value of our enterprise to our carrying value  including goodwill 
if our carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of our enterprise goodwill with the carrying amount of our goodwill 
to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the fair value of all of our assets  with the implied goodwill amount being the difference between the enterprise fair value and the aggregate of the identified asset fair value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the critical factors used in the determination of fair values of the enterprise and of the identifiable intangible assets include the discount rate  our cost of capital  cash flow multiples  expansion and infrastructure costs  other carriers multiples  expected customer growth rates  churn factors  service upgrade trends  and operating cost trends 
therefore  determining fair values and expected future discounted cash flows involves significant judgment on our part 
in particular  if customers decreased  our churn rate increased  customer or roaming revenue decreased  or costs to provide service increased  the likelihood of impairment would increase 
the fair value of an asset or an enterprise is the price at which the asset or enterprise could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties 
therefore  market prices from active markets are the best measure and are used when available 
if there is not an available active market  the measurement is based on the best information available  including similar transactions  acquisition cost per customer or area population  and expected discounted future cash flows 
acquisitions and discontinued operations we continually seek opportunities to acquire attractive wireless markets as part of our overall business strategy  particularly markets near our current service areas 
the following are the most recent transactions 
acquisition of pennsylvania rsa on september   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  american cellular  acquired the non license wireless assets of endless mountains wireless  llc in pennsylvania rsa 
we are operating endless mountains licensed mhz spectrum under a spectrum manager lease 
in march  we have the right to acquire endless mountains pennsylvania rsa mhz license  subject to fcc approval at the time of acquisition 
if exercised  our acquisition of the license covering the leased spectrum is expected to close in mid to late the total purchase price for all acquired assets  including the fcc license  is approximately million 
we plan to upgrade endless mountains network with gprs edge data capability 
we offer products and services in pennsylvania rsa under the cellularone service mark 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from pennsylvania rsa beginning september  
table of contents acquisition of rfb cellular  inc on december   we completed the acquisition of the michigan wireless assets of rfb cellular  inc  or rfb  and certain affiliates for million 
rfb is made up of michigan rsa and michigan rsa 
we purchased these assets in an auction conducted under sections and of the us bankruptcy code 
we provide service in most of the northern part of michigan  including the upper peninsula 
the rfb acquisition allowed us to expand our service area to cover the entire northern part of the state 
we offer products and services in michigan rsa and michigan rsa under the cellularone service mark 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from rfb beginning december  acquisition of npi on june   we acquired certain assets of npi for approximately million 
these assets include pcs licenses and a gsm gprs edge network covering areas in northern michigan 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from npi beginning june  maryland michigan swap on february   we transferred our maryland rsa wireless property in exchange for cingular wireless michigan rsa wireless property  million in cash and its one percent ownership interests in texas rsa and oklahoma and rsas 
we are the majority owner of these three partnerships 
we have reclassified our historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the operations of our maryland rsa property as discontinued operations 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from michigan rsa beginning february  california alaska swap on june   we transferred our two remaining wireless properties in california to at t wireless in exchange for its two wireless properties in alaska  and all of the outstanding shares of series aa preferred stock of dobson communications that it previously held  which we then cancelled 
we have reclassified our historical consolidated financial statements to reflect the operations of our california properties as discontinued operations 
as a result of the completion of this transaction  our consolidated financial statements only include the operating results from the two wireless properties in alaska beginning june  new roaming agreement with cingular wireless on august   our two operating subsidiaries  dobson cellular and american cellular  entered into a new  multi year roaming agreement with cingular wireless  their primary wireless roaming partner  and amended the existing gsm operating agreements with the former at t wireless entity 
the new roaming agreement  which replaces the previous roaming agreements with cingular wireless and the former at t wireless entity  established a new roaming rate structure that was effective as of april  the new roaming agreement s key provisions include the following mutual agreement to lower roaming rates  with us paying cingular a flat incollect rate through mid that is approximately half the blended rate in previous roaming agreements  agreement to continue to mutually prefer one another for roaming through the term of the new roaming agreement  which has been extended approximately one year through mid  
table of contents we received approximately million from cingular as a settlement for prior claims under various agreements between us and the former at t wireless  and have and will continue to receive certain formula based residual payments in connection with such settlement through mid at the latest  the new roaming agreement provides for home on home roaming in areas where both carriers operate  and we have acquired from cingular  for million  mhz of spectrum covering million pops  consisting of youngstown  ohio and ohio rsa  and erie and sharon  pennsylvania and a portion of the pennsylvania rsa 
we have also received an option to lease additional spectrum covering million pops from cingular 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table summarizes our key operating data for the periods indicated year ended december  market population ending subscribers market penetration gross subscriber additions average subscribers arpu average monthly post paid churn represents the population in our licensed areas for the period indicated 
the and results are based upon the population estimates provided by mapinfo corporation  a location software company  and the results are based upon the claritas bureau of census results  adjusted to exclude those portions of our rsas and msas not covered by our licenses 
market penetration is calculated by dividing ending subscribers by market population 
includes american cellular from august   the date we acquired it 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue by average subscribers and dividing by the number of months in the period 
we exclude roaming revenue from this calculation  since roaming revenue is not derived from our subscribers 
average monthly post paid churn represents the percentage of the post paid subscribers that deactivate service each month 
the calculation divides the total post paid deactivations during the period by the average post paid subscribers for the period 

table of contents basis of presentation to provide a more comparable basis of our management s discussion and analysis  we have presented our results of operations from continuing operations for the periods indicated  along with the impact from newly acquired markets on our results of operations 
for the purpose of this management s discussion and analysis  the impact from newly acquired markets refer to the change in our results of operations due to our recent acquisitions 
our recent acquisitions include operations from the two alaska properties from june   american cellular from august   the michigan rsa property from february   the npi markets from june   the rfb markets from december  and the pennsylvania rsa from september  the following table sets forth the components of our results of operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  adjusted results percentage change impact from without year ended in adjusted results newly impact from december  versus actual acquired newlyacquired results actual markets markets actual vs

includes the impact of almost two months of operations for the michigan rsa property that was acquired on february   almost six months of operations for the npi markets that were acquired on june   twelve months of operations for the rfb markets that were acquired on december  and all the operations of pennsylvania rsa property that was acquired on september  includes the impact of almost six months of operations for the two alaska properties that were acquired on june   over seven months of operations for american cellular that was acquired on august   and all of the operations of michigan rsa property acquired on february   the npi markets acquired june  and the rfb markets acquired on december  subscribers our subscriber base comprises three types of subscribers post paid  reseller and pre paid 
our post paid subscribers accounted for of our subscriber base at december  and at december  these subscribers pay a monthly access fee for a wireless service plan that generally includes a fixed amount of 
table of contents minutes and certain service features 
in addition to the monthly access fee  these subscribers are typically billed in arrears for long distance charges  roaming charges and rate plan overages 
our reseller subscribers are similar to our post paid subscribers in that they pay monthly fees to utilize our network and services 
however  these subscribers are billed by a third party  which we refer to as a reseller  who has effectively resold our service to the end user  which we refer to as a subscriber 
we in turn bill the reseller for the monthly usage of the subscriber 
our reseller base accounted for of our total subscriber base at december  and at december  our pre paid subscribers  which are subscribers that pre pay for an agreed upon amount of usage  accounted for of our subscriber base at december  and at december  during the year ended december   we experienced an increase in our gross subscriber additions 
in recent past  our gross subscriber additions had been decreasing as a result of increased competition attributable to an accelerating pace of improvements in the quality of digital technology and increased products offered to the consumer 
however  our deployment of gsm gprs edge in our networks during and has helped this decline to level off and result in growth in our gross subscriber additions for the year ended december  when comparing to  total gross subscriber additions without the impact from newly acquired markets were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  when comparing to  total gross subscriber additions without the impact from newly acquired markets were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  as of december   gsm subscribers accounted for of our subscriber base  compared to as of december  since the middle of  we have experienced churn rates above our historical levels 
this increase in churn is primarily the result of two factors impacting our business 
first  we have experienced challenges operating both a tdma and gsm gprs edge network and in managing the migration of our customer base from tdma to gsm 
this has impacted the level of customer satisfaction with our service in certain of our markets 
we have implemented several initiatives that have and should continue to improve  the quality of our networks 
secondly  wlnp  which allows customers to keep their wireless phone number in their local area when switching to a different service provider  was implemented in all of our markets by may  although we expect churn to improve as we continue our initiatives to improve customer satisfaction  churn could continue to be adversely affected by continued network issues and wlnp 
operating revenue our operating revenue consists of service revenue  roaming revenue and equipment and other revenue 
service revenue we derive service revenue by providing wireless services to our customers 
the wireless industry has experienced declining average revenue per minute as competition among wireless service providers has led to reductions in rates for airtime 
in recent past  this decline in revenue per minute  although it was somewhat offset by increases in average minutes of use  resulted in the decline of our average monthly service revenue per subscriber 
however  with the deployment of our gsm gprs edge technology in the last half of  we have experienced increases in our average monthly service revenue per subscriber from prior levels  primarily as a result of additional voice and data services available with this technology 
in addition  we have applied for federal eligible telecommunications carrier  or etc  designation in certain states in which we provide wireless service to qualifying high cost areas 
success in obtaining etc status has and may continue to make available to us an additional source of revenue that would be used to provide  maintain and improve the service we provide in those high cost areas  thus also increasing our average monthly service revenue per subscriber 
etc revenue totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  with our additional voice and data offerings available with gsm gprs edge technology and with our etc designation in certain states  we believe there is continued growth opportunity throughout for our average monthly service revenue per subscriber 
for the year ended december   our service revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  the increase in our service revenue was primarily 
table of contents attributable to an increase in average monthly service revenue per subscriber as a result of the continued migration of our subscribers to our gsm gprs edge offerings and etc revenue 
when comparing to  the increase in our service revenue resulted from an increase in customers due to our newly acquired markets  offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per subscriber 
roaming revenue we derive roaming revenue by providing service to subscribers of other wireless providers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
roaming revenue has traditionally had higher margins than revenue from our subscribers 
we achieve these higher margins because we incur relatively lower incremental costs related to billing  customer service and collections in servicing roaming customers as compared to our home subscribers 
however  our roaming margins have been declining due to increased market pressures and competition among wireless providers resulting in reduced roaming rates 
our roaming yield roaming revenue  which includes airtime  toll charges and surcharges  divided by roaming minutes of use was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we expect our roaming yield to continue to decline 
as previously discussed  we recently entered into a new roaming agreement with our most significant roaming partner  cingular wireless  which accounted for approximately of our roaming minutes of use for the year ended december   approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  under this new roaming agreement  roaming rates will decline through even though this contract provides for decreasing rates over time  we believe this roaming contract is beneficial because it secures existing traffic and provides opportunity for a continuing increase in traffic volumes 
roaming revenue tends to be impacted by seasonality 
historically  we have experienced higher roaming minutes of use and related roaming revenue during the second and third quarters of each year  as users tend to travel more and  therefore  use their wireless phones more  during the spring and summer months 
for the year ended december   our roaming revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  this increase was a result of a increase in roaming minutes offset by a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use as contractual rates were lower for the year ended december   compared to the same period in when comparing to  without the impact from newly acquired markets  our roaming revenue decreased as a result of a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use as contractual rates decreased during and  offset by a slight increase in roaming minutes 
equipment and other revenue equipment revenue is revenue from selling wireless equipment to our subscribers 
equipment revenue is recognized when the equipment is delivered to the customer 
other revenue is primarily related to a settlement for prior claims and residual payments under various agreements between us and the former at t wireless and rental income from the lease of space on company owned towers  prior to their sale in june and october of for the year ended december   our equipment and other revenue increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  this increase was primarily the result of approximately million related to a settlement for prior claims and residual payments under various agreements between us and the former at t wireless  an increase in equipment revenue due to the increase in gross subscriber additions and customers upgrading to gsm gprs edge rate plans and increases in activation fees charged to customers  slightly offset by a decrease in rental income due the sale of our towers in described below 
we will continue to receive certain formula based residual payments in connection with the at t wireless settlement through mid we estimate that these future payments will be between million and million per quarter 
when comparing to  without the impact of newly acquired markets  our equipment and other revenue decreased 
this decrease in equipment and other revenue was primarily due to the elimination of amounts charged to our previously unconsolidated affiliates for the use of shared assets  offset by an increase in the number of customers upgrading to new rate plans and purchasing new handsets and an increase in rental income 

table of contents operating expenses our primary operating expense categories include cost of service  cost of equipment  marketing and selling costs  general and administrative costs  depreciation and amortization and gain on disposition of operating assets 
cost of service our cost of service consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our facilities utilized in providing service to customers and amounts paid to third party wireless providers for providing service to our subscribers when our subscribers roam into their markets  referred to as roaming costs 
as previously discussed  we recently signed a new roaming agreement with cingular wireless  our primary roaming partner  which reduced our roaming cost per minute of use effective april  to a flat rate that will remain constant through mid while future rates charged by third party providers may continue to decrease  we expect our overall growth in off network minutes of use to grow at a rate faster than per minute costs will decline 
therefore  we expect that our roaming costs may increase in future periods 
in addition  as a result of the sale and leaseback of of our towers in  we expect our leasing costs to increase in future periods  thus increasing our total cost of service 
the following table sets forth the results of the components of our cost of service for the periods indicated year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage in thousands network costs roaming costs total cost of service for the year ended december   our network costs  which are the costs we incur in operating our wireless network and providing service to our customers  increased  compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  this increase is a result of adding new circuits and cell sites related to our new gsm gprs edge network  as well as increasing costs as a result of providing more service features  such as handset replacement coverage and wireless internet and an increase in rent expense related to our towers we sold in described below 
when comparing to  without the impact of newly acquired markets  our network costs increased as a result of adding new circuits and cell sites related to our new gsm gprs edge network  as well as increasing costs as a result of providing more service features  such as handset insurance and ring tones 
for the year ended december   our roaming costs decreased compared to the year ended december  and increased compared to the year ended december  when comparing to  the decline was primarily a result of a decrease in roaming costs per minute of use as contractual rates were lower for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   offset by an increase in the minutes used by our customers on third party wireless providers networks 
when comparing to  without the impact from newly acquired markets  our roaming costs declined 
this decline was primarily a result of a decrease in roaming costs per minute of use as contractual rates were lower for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   offset by an increase in the minutes used by our customers on third party wireless providers networks 
with the continued migration of our customer base to gsm gprs edge rate plans  which promote more off network usage  we expect our minutes of use by our customers on third party wireless providers networks to continue to increase 
cost of equipment our cost of equipment represents the costs associated with wireless equipment and accessories sold 
cost of equipment is impacted by the volume of equipment transactions 
the volume of equipment transactions is impacted by gross subscriber additions and customer upgrades 
we  like other wireless providers  have continued to use discounts on sales of phone equipment and have continued to offer free phone promotions 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales 
while we expect to continue these discounts 
table of contents and promotions  we believe that these promotions will result in increased service revenue from an increase in the number of wireless subscribers and from higher priced rate plans 
although gross subscriber additions during may increase compared to the and levels  customer upgrades are expected to be less 
therefore  we expect our cost of equipment to remain fairly constant during for the year ended december   our cost of equipment increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  cost of equipment increased due to an increase in gross subscriber additions and an increase in the number of customers upgrading to new rate plans and purchasing new handsets 
when comparing to  without the impact of newly acquired markets  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of handsets sold to customers and an increase in the number of customers upgrading to new rate plans and purchasing new handsets 
most of these customers were upgrading to our new gsm gprs edge rate plans 
marketing and selling costs our marketing and selling costs include advertising  compensation paid to sales personnel and independent agents and all other costs to market and sell wireless products and services 
we pay commissions to sales personnel and independent dealers for new business generated 
for the year ended december   our marketing and selling costs increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  the increase in our marketing and selling costs was due to an increase in advertising costs spent to promote our gsm gprs edge rate plans along with an increase in commissions paid as a result of an increase in gross subscriber additions 
when comparing to  without the impact of newly acquired markets  the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising costs spent to launch our new gsm gprs edge rate plans 
general and administrative costs our general and administrative costs include all infrastructure costs  including costs for customer support  billing  collections and corporate administration 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative costs increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  the increase in our general and administrative costs was primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense  costs related to the restructuring of our call center operations and an increase in legal fees associated with certain regulatory matters  offset by efficiencies gained from centralized administrative functions 
when comparing to  the increases in our general and administrative costs were primarily a result of increased infrastructure costs as a result of the overall growth of our business and higher legal and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense represents the costs associated with the depreciation of our fixed assets  primarily wireless systems and equipment  and the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
however  we do not amortize our wireless license acquisition costs or goodwill 
rather  these assets are subject to periodic evaluations for impairment 
during  the increases in depreciation and amortization  as a result of newly acquired or constructed assets  were mostly offset as older assets became fully depreciated 
thus  for the year ended december   our depreciation and amortization expense remained fairly constant compared to the year ended december  when comparing to  depreciation and amortization expense increased due to fixed assets acquired or constructed  primarily from our gsm gprs edge network buildout in and during  we expect our depreciation and amortization expense to increase slightly due to accelerating the amortization of our customer lists 
gain on disposition of operating assets our gain on disposition of operating assets for the year ended december  was a result of the sale and leaseback of of our towers 
on june  we recognized million of the gain from the transactions and 
table of contents we deferred the remaining gain of million  which will be recognized over the lease term of ten years 
we expect to recognize a gain of approximately million per year over the life of the lease 
non operating results interest expense for the year ended december   our interest expense increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  this increase in our interest expense is due to an increase in our notes payable outstanding and the average interest rate of our notes payable  partially offset by a decrease in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
when comparing to  the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to an increase of notes payable on august  of million related to our acquisition of american cellular 
loss gain from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   our loss from extinguishment of debt of million was due to the redemption of the entire million outstanding principal amount of our senior notes 
the gain from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was due to our repurchase of million principal amount of our senior notes at an aggregate cost of approximately million  excluding accrued interest 
we reported a gain on extinguishment of debt  net of deferred financing costs  of approximately million as a result of these purchases 
in addition  we purchased approximately million principal amount of our senior notes at an aggregate cost of approximately million  excluding accrued interest 
we reported a gain on extinguishment of debt  net of deferred financing costs  of approximately million as a result of these purchases 
these gains were offset by a loss on redemption of the remaining dobson sygnet senior notes  and a loss related to the amendment of the dobson cellular credit facility 
we redeemed the remaining million of dobson sygnet senior notes and recognized a loss from extinguishment of debt of million due to the premium paid and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
we paid off and amended the dobson cellular credit facility  and we recognized a loss of million due to the write off of deferred financing costs related to the dobson cellular credit facility 
the loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was due to paying off the dobson operating company  or doc  credit facility  the sygnet credit facility and million principal amount of the dobson sygnet senior notes  described below under notes payable 
redemption and repurchases of  and dividends on  preferred stock as a result of implementing sfas no 
on july   dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock began being presented as a financing expense  included in our net loss  while dividends on our conditionally redeemable preferred stock remained below our net loss 
as a result of the mid year implementation  for the year ended december   dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock are presented as both a financing expense  included in our net loss  and as an item below our net loss 
thus  our statement of operations includes the following year ended december  in thousands financing expense above net loss loss gain on redemption and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock items applicable to common stockholders below net loss dividends on preferred stock gain on redemption and repurchases of preferred stock we issued  shares of series f preferred stock on august   which is a conditionally redeemable preferred stock 
the dividends on these shares were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  and are included as 
table of contents dividends on preferred stock below our net loss 
in addition  on february   we issued  shares of series aa preferred stock which was conditionally redeemable preferred stock 
upon transfer of the series aa preferred stock by at t wireless on june   these shares were canceled 
the dividend on the series aa preferred stock was million for the year ended december   and is included as dividends on preferred stock below our net loss 
the dividends on our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaled million for the year ended december   which compares to million for the year ended december  and million on a combined basis for the year ended december  this decrease in mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends from to is the result of the reduction in the number of shares of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock outstanding due to redemption and repurchases of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock during  and during the year ended december   we completed two exchange offers on our senior exchangeable preferred stock 
on august   we exchanged  shares of preferred stock for  newly issued shares of class a common stock and million in cash 
these repurchases resulted in a loss on redemption and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock totaling approximately million 
in addition  on october   we exchange  shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock and  shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock for  shares of our class a common stock and cash consideration of million 
we reported a loss on this transaction of approximately million in the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock and  shares of our preferred stock for an aggregate price of million 
these repurchases resulted in a gain from redemption and repurchases of preferred stock totaling million 
the gain on redemption and repurchases of preferred stock has been included in our loss from continuing operations 
during the year ended december   prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock and  shares of our preferred stock  for an aggregate price of million 
this resulted in a gain from repurchase of preferred stock totaling million 
in addition  at t wireless transferred to us all of our series aa preferred stock  which had a fair value that was substantially lower than our carrying value  thus resulting in a gain on redemption of preferred stock of million 
therefore  our total gain on redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock prior to adoption of sfas no 
on july  was million 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 in  we repurchased a total of  shares of our preferred stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  including fees and the related write off of deferred financing costs  resulted in a loss on redemptions and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of million 
although our redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock are in two separate captions for the year ended december   they netted to a gain of million on a combined basis 
other income  net for the year ended december   our other income increased compared to the years ended december  and when comparing to  this increase was a result of an increase in interest income  slightly offset by the expensing of the cost of our unsuccessful january preferred stock exchange offer  which expired in march without the minimum tender condition being satisfied 
when comparing to  our other income decreased  primarily due to a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates for the year ended december  discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  we had income from discontinued operations 
our discontinued operations during relate to the maryland properties included in the swap with cingular wireless  while our discontinued operations during relate to both the california properties included in the swap with at t wireless and the maryland properties included in the swap with cingular wireless 
liquidity and capital resources we have required  and will likely continue to require  substantial capital to further develop  expand and upgrade our wireless systems and those we may acquire 
we have financed our operations through cash flows from 
table of contents operating activities  and when necessary  bank debt and the sale of debt and equity securities 
although we cannot provide assurance  assuming successful implementation of our strategy  including the continuing development of our wireless systems and significant and sustained growth in our cash flows  we believe that availability under our dobson cellular revolving line of credit  our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently expected capital expenditures  working capital and debt service obligations over the next few years 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates as a result of  among other things  the demand for our services and the regulatory  technological and competitive developments that may arise 
we may have to refinance our notes at their final maturities  which begin in sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings  vendor financing and the issuance of equity or debt securities 
some or all of these financing options may not be available to us in the future  since these resources are dependent upon our financial performance and condition  along with certain other factors that are beyond our control  such as economic events  technological changes and business trends and developments 
thus  if at any time financing is not available on acceptable terms  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
working capital and net cash flow at december   we had working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of and an unrestricted cash balance of million  which compares to working capital of million  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of  an unrestricted cash balance of million and marketable securities of million at december  our net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase from to was primarily due to increased operating income  which generated more net cash receipts in than in and changes in current assets and current liabilities 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a decrease in our operating income  a decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations and decreases resulting from our changes in our current assets and liabilities 
for additional analysis of the changes impacting loss from continuing operations see results of operations for the years ended december   and we expect that any future improvements in cash provided by operating activities will primarily be driven by improvements in income from continuing operations 
we used cash in investing activities for the years ended december   and investing activities are typically related to capital expenditures  purchases and sales of marketable securities and other assets and acquisitions and sales of markets 
we typically expect to use cash in investing activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop our network 
our net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related to capital expenditures of million and the purchase of pennsylvania rsa s wireless assets  partially offset by proceeds related to the sale of of our towers during and sales of marketable securities 
our net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   primarily related to capital expenditures of million  the purchase of michigan  and rsa s and npi s wireless assets and purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by sales of marketable securities  cash received from cingular wireless as part of our michigan maryland swap and receipt of funds held in escrow for contingencies on sold assets 
we used cash in financing activities for the years ended december   and financing activities are typically related to proceeds from our notes payable and credit facility offset by repayments of our notes payable and credit facility  financing costs and distributions to minority interest holders 
our financing activities for the year ended december   were primarily related to the repayment of our senior notes  financing costs related to our exchange offer  deferred financing costs related to our new notes and convertible debentures and distributions to minority interest holders  partially offset by our new notes and convertible debentures issued in september 
our financing activity uses for the year ended december   consisted primarily of repayments and repurchases of our credit facilities and notes  redemption and repurchases of preferred stock and deferred financing costs  offset by proceeds from our credit facilities and notes

as allowed  we have historically accounted for stock options using 
table of contents the accounting principles of opinion the impact of adopting the provisions of statement r will be to increase our non cash compensation expense in future periods
