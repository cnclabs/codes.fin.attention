table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of advanced digital satellite communications and other wireless and secure networking and signal processing equipment and services to the government and commercial markets 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the global satellite communications equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for our government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications products incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
our company is organized principally in two segments government and commercial 
our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes tactical data links  including mids  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  and government satellite communication systems and products  including uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and innovative broadband solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
we have been increasing our focus in recent years on offering satellite based communications products and systems solutions to address commercial market needs 
in pursuing this strategy  we have acquired four strategic satellite communication equipment providers the satellite networks business of scientific atlanta sa in fiscal year  comsat laboratories products business from lockheed martin in fiscal year  us monolithics  llc in fiscal year  and efficient channel coding  inc in fiscal year our commercial business accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year  of our revenues in fiscal year and of our revenues in fiscal year to date  our principal commercial offerings include very small aperture terminals vsats  broadband internet equipment over satellite  network control systems  network integration services  network operation services  gateway infrastructure  antenna systems and other satellite ground stations 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we have won several important projects in the five key broadband markets enterprise  consumer  in flight  maritime and ground mobile applications 
the commercial segment comprises two business product groups satellite networks and antenna systems 
our commercial business offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs based technology  mobile broadband products and systems for in flight  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise vsat networks products and services  satellite networking systems design and technology development  mmic design and development  with an emphasis in systems engineering of packaged components  which specializes in high frequency communication technology design and development  
table of contents digital integrated circuits  modem products  and development engineering  and antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers 
with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction  and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating  and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target high technology satellite communication and other communication markets where the customer places a high priority on the solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining these awards 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  approximately for fiscal year and  and for fiscal year  of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a stipulated price 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the specific requirements of a customer s engineering and production order and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year  of revenues during fiscal year and of revenues during fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop and manufacture satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communications equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support our business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to our competitors or peers 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
our awards have grown from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  to million in fiscal year  to million in fiscal year and to million in fiscal year the awards growth each of the past six years and the conversion of certain of the awards has contributed to our revenue growth 
there are a number of large new business opportunities we are pursuing in fiscal year in the government segment  the opportunities include the mids lvt lot vii production order  international mids lvt orders  new mids joint tactical radio system contracts  additional funding for current information assurance projects  new information assurance contracts using our haipis technology  and orders for our kg and kg products 
in 
table of contents our commercial segment  the opportunities include new production orders for consumer and mobile broadband systems  new consumer broadband development systems  further penetration in the north american market with enterprise vsat customers and antenna systems 
the timing of these orders is not entirely predictable  so our revenue may vary somewhat from quarter to quarter or even year to year 
for the current year  our income from operations  excluding the income statement line amortization of intangible assets and compensation expense from accelerated vesting of certain employee stock options is approximately nine percent of revenues 
to the extent we are not generating sufficient gross profit from revenues  we strive to adjust other operating expenses to increase this percentage 
due to the need to increase our new contracts awards  the need to expand our product portfolio  the high level of customer funded research and development  and our operating performance  we have slowly improved this percentage over the last few fiscal years 
we expect improvement in our profit percentage over the next two years 
generating positive cash flows from operating activities was a financial priority for us in fiscal years and and will continue to be a focus in fiscal year key areas which we monitor to achieve the cash flow objective include generating income from operations  reducing our unbilled accounts receivable by monitoring program performance to ensure performance milestones are achieved  reducing the cycle time for amounts billed to customers and their related collection  and reducing inventory on hand 
we expect that our capital needs for fiscal year will be ten to twenty percent less than fiscal year in fiscal year  we initiated and completed facility expansion and modernization projects in carlsbad  california  duluth  georgia  and germantown  maryland  as well as expanded our production test equipment and lab development equipment to meet customer program requirements and growth forecasts 
in fiscal year  we have additional facility projects planned in carlsbad  california  and phoenix  arizona  as well as production test equipment and information technology projects to support our growth needs 
our facility needs have normally been met with long term lease agreements  but we do anticipate additional tenant improvements over the next two fiscal years associated with our expansion 
additionally  as our employee base increases  the need for additional computers and other equipment will also increase 
included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million we received as a result of a settlement with xetron corporation 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million related to this settlement 
included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million received from scientific atlanta and  in proceeds from the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of orbcomm

on december   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of efficient channel coding  inc ecc  a privately held designer and supplier of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems 
the initial purchase price of approximately million was comprised primarily of million in cash consideration   in direct acquisition costs and  related to the fair value of options exchanged at the closing date 
the million of cash consideration less cash acquired of approximately  resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately million 
an additional million in consideration is payable in cash and or stock at the company s option on or prior to the eighteen month anniversary of the closing date based on ecc meeting certain financial performance targets 
on may   the company agreed to pay the maximum earn out amount to the former ecc stockholders in the amount of million 
the million will be paid in cash or stock  at the company s option  in may additional purchase price consideration of million will be recorded as additional satellite networks goodwill in first quarter of fiscal year at december   the company recorded million in identifiable intangible assets and million in goodwill based on the fair values and the preliminary allocation of purchase price of the acquired assets and 
table of contents assumed liabilities 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of ecc from the date of acquisition in the company s satellite networks product line in the commercial segment 
the acquisition of ecc is complementary to viasat because we will benefit from their complimentary technologies  namely dvb s and asic design capabilities  customers and highly skilled workforce 
the potential opportunities these benefits provide to our satellite networks product group in our commercial segment were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill 
the intangible assets and goodwill recognized will be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over time and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
in the fiscal years ended march  and april   we recorded losses of approximately million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
there were no significant charges for loss contracts in the fiscal year ended april  assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
the company believes it has established appropriate systems and processes to enable it to reasonably estimate future cost on its programs through regular quarterly evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  the company has not experienced 
table of contents significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis 
however  a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
for example  a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of march  would change our pre tax income by approximately million 
the company also has contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products in accordance with sab  staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with eitf   accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
capitalized software development costs we charge costs of developing software for sale to research and development expense when incurred  until technological feasibility has been established 
software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
once the product is available for general release  we amortize the software development costs based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product not to exceed five years 
the determination of net realizable value involves judgment and estimates of future revenues to be derived from a product  as well as estimates of future costs of manufacturing that product 
we use our experience in the marketplace in making judgments in estimating net realizable value  but our estimates may differ from the actual outcome 
we periodically assess the assumptions underlying our estimates and  if necessary  we would adjust the carrying amount of capitalized software development costs downward to our new estimate of net realizable value 
we did not capitalize any costs related to software developed for resale in the fiscal years ended march   april  or april  amortization expense of software development costs was million for fiscal year and fiscal year and million for fiscal year these software development costs are included in other assets on the balance sheet and we record the related amortization expense as a charge to cost of revenues on the statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers comprise a larger part of our revenues 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  warranty accrual we provide limited warranties on a majority of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
we 
table of contents classify the amounts we expect to incur within twelve months as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
impairment of goodwill we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
the only reporting units which have goodwill assigned to them are the businesses which were acquired and have been included in our commercial segment 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairments 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company maintained a valuation allowance of  and  against deferred tax assets at march  and april   respectively  relating to research and development credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes 
derivatives we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest income expense as gains losses on derivative instruments 
gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as gains losses on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects our earnings 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward 
table of contents contracts was a liability of  at march  and we had million of notional value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at march  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a liability of  at april  and we had million of notional value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at april  we had no foreign currency forward or option contracts outstanding at april  stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method and provides pro forma disclosures of net income as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
at march   we had stock based compensation plans described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for options issued to employees and non employee directors under those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
generally  no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
also  no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock is not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in fiscal year  the company recorded total stock compensation expense of million of which  related to stock options issued at acquisition of ecc and million was recorded upon the acceleration of vesting of certain employee stock options 
stock compensation expense presented in the consolidated statement of operations was recorded as follows  to cost of revenue   to selling  general and administrative expense and  to independent research and development 
in fiscal year and  the company recorded and  in compensation expense  respectively 
on december   as a part of the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of ecc  the company issued  unvested incentive stock options under the efficient channel coding  inc long term incentive plan assumed under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded  in deferred stock based compensation which is being amortized to compensation expense over the remaining service period 
the company amortized  to compensation expense related to this deferred stock based compensation through march  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  we disclose our net income or loss and net income or loss per share on a pro forma basis as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which the company is required to adopt effective with our first quarter of fiscal effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date will include a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with original provision of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after april   based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on historical volatility  consistent with sfas and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on a quarterly average of implied yields in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate 
table of contents paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically three or five years 
we may elect to use different assumptions under black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
option acceleration on march   the board of directors of the company accelerated the vesting of certain unvested employee stock options previously awarded to the company s employees under the company s second amended and restated equity participation plan 
stock options held by the company s non employee directors were not accelerated 
options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock representing approximately of the company s total current outstanding options were subject to this acceleration 
all of the accelerated options were in the money and had exercise prices ranging from to 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
because the exercise price of all options subject to acceleration was lower than the fair market value of our underlying common stock on the date of acceleration  we recorded million in compensation expense 
the accelerated stock options are subject to lock up restrictions preventing the sale of any shares acquired through the exercise of an accelerated stock option prior to the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the stock option s original vesting terms 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to eliminate the recognition of the related compensation expense in the company s future consolidated financial statements with respect to these unvested stock options upon adopting sfas r 
the company recognized a pre tax charge for estimated compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal fourth quarter ended march  after considering expected employee turnover rates to reflect  absent the acceleration  the in the money value of accelerated stock options the company estimates would have been forfeited unvested pursuant to their original terms 
the company will adjust this estimated compensation expense in future periods to record the impact of actual employee turnover on the compensation expense recognized at the time of acceleration 
at march   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of four years

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
years ended dollar percentage march  april  increase increase in millions  except percentages revenues the increase in revenues was due to the higher customer awards received in the past two fiscal years consisting of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year and the conversion of certain of those awards into revenues 
increased revenues were experienced in both our government and commercial segments 
growth was primarily derived from our tactical data link products  principally mids production sales and mids jtrs development program of approximately million  government satellite communication systems products increasing approximately million  consumer broadband sales of approximately million and certain mobile broadband product sales of approximately million as well as the acquisition of ecc in our fiscal third quarter contributing approximately million to annual sales 
gross profit 
years ended dollar percentage march  april  increase increase in millions  except percentages gross profit percentage of revenues the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the margin dollars generated from higher revenues and improved program performance in the government segment over fiscal year  in particular improved profitability of mids programs and lower product sustaining costs 
the increase in gross profit also includes a benefit related to a legal settlement with xetron corporation in the first quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a net benefit to cost of revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by gross profit reductions from higher than planned development costs in a radio frequency micro positioning technology of million and lower vsat product margins 
in addition  gross profit was reduced by compensation expense charge of approximately  related to the accelerated vesting of certain employee stock options 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
years ended dollar percentage march  april  increase increase in millions  except percentages selling  general and administrative percentage of revenues the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses year over year is primarily attributable to an increase in selling costs from higher new contract awards and increased revenues  a compensation expense charge of approximately  related to the accelerated vesting of certain employee stock options and higher facility costs of approximately million related to relocation of our atlanta and maryland facilities  offset by various other net decreases 
the reduction in percentage is due to the lower support costs required to operate the company as it grows 
sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development  marketing and sales  bid and proposal  finance  contract administration and general management 
some sg a expenses are difficult to predict and vary based on specific government and commercial sales opportunities

the higher ir d expenses are principally for the development of new information assurance  military satellite communication and next generation vsat equipment  and reflects our recognition of certain opportunities in these markets and the need to invest in the development of new technologies to meet these opportunities 
amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from acquisitions completed in fiscal year  and fiscal year are being amortized over useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
the expected amortization expense of long lived intangible assets for the next five fiscal years is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the increase resulted from higher commitment fees as a result of increased line of credit availability and additional interest expense related to amendment of certain prior year tax returns compared to prior year

the higher sales of satellite networking equipment revenue reflects higher customer awards stemming from greater market acceptance of our products  the conversion of those awards to revenue  more favorable market conditions in the commercial telecommunications market for our products and further development of our in flight and consumer satellite broadband internet systems 
the increase in antenna systems revenues primarily related to the conversion of prior year backlog to sales

absence these benefits  sg a expenses in fiscal year would have been million of revenues 
therefore  sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  declined in fiscal year over the reduction in percentage is due to the lower support costs required to operate the company as it grows 
independent research and development 
years ended dollar percentage april  april  decrease decrease in millions  except percentages independent research and development percentage of revenues ir d expenses have declined in each of the past two years compared to the prior year 
the decrease in ir d expenses reflects the reduced efforts for company funded development projects due to the increase of orders over the past months  where customer funded development was part of the contract  and the completion of the kg development during in fiscal year versus a full year in fiscal year amortization of intangible assets 
the intangible assets from acquisitions in fiscal year and in fiscal year are being amortized over useful lives ranging from two to ten years 
the amortization of intangible assets will decrease each year as the intangible assets with shorter lives become fully amortized 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease resulted from lower outstanding borrowings coupled with lower loan fees in fiscal year at april  and april   there were no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit

the higher sales of satellite networking equipment revenue reflects higher customer awards stemming from greater market acceptance of our products and the conversion of those awards to revenue 
the reduction in antenna systems revenues are related to lower year over year new contract awards

backlog as reflected in the table below  funded and firm funded plus unfunded backlog increased during fiscal year with the increases in firm backlog coming from our commercial segment 
new contract awards in the current year increased backlog to a new all time high for us 
march  april  in millions firm backlog government segment commercial segment total funded backlog government segment commercial segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
over the last year  as more of our products have been placed into market  we have seen a greater percentage of awards from book and ship type orders 
this has resulted in backlog not growing as fast as the past three fiscal years 
total new awards for both commercial and defense products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year 
table of contents backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing and equity financing 
the general cash needs of our government and commercial segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts ie product or service  development or production  and timing of payments in backlog  the quality of the customer ie ie government or commercial  domestic or international and the duration of the contract 
in addition  for both of our segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government segment tend to be more of a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  us government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the contract 
in the commercial segment  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer will typically affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial environment tends to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to primarily related to a higher year over year net income of million  approximately million increased conversion of receivables to cash and an increase in current liabilities of approximately million 
the increase in current liabilities primarily relates to a million increase in deferred rent  million increase in collections in excess of revenues  and million increase in other liabilities due to growth in operations 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in investments in inventories of million 
the increase in inventory was primarily related a greater percentage of book and ship type orders  which required more on hand inventory  and a shift in manufacturing production in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to an off shore contract manufacturer and the related in transit inventory 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in of million 
we spent million for the acquisition of ecc and million for capital  principally for facility expansion and production test equipment to support our growth in fiscal year compared to acquiring million in equipment in fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million 
this increase for fiscal year was primarily the result of cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  principally related to contract performance leaving borrowing availability under our line of credit of million 
at april   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 

table of contents on january   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility the facility with union bank of california  comerica bank and silicon valley bank 
borrowings under the facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of million  including up to million of letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at our option  at either the lender s prime rate or at libor london interbank offered rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on the ratio of viasat s total funded debt to ebitda income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of viasat s personal property assets 
the facility contains financial covenants that set a minimum ebitda limit for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter at million  a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at million and a minimum quick ratio sum of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities  divided by current liabilities as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at to 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants at march  included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million we received as a result of a settlement with xetron corporation 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million related to this settlement 
on october   we sent scientific atlanta a claim for indemnification under the terms of the asset purchase agreement related to the acquisition of scientific atlanta s satellite networks business satellite networks business in april on november   scientific atlanta filed a complaint united states district court  northern district of georgia  atlanta division for declaratory judgment seeking to resolve our claim for indemnification through litigation 
in response to scientific atlanta s complaint  on january   we filed a formal claim against scientific atlanta for  among other things  fraud  breach of warranty  contractual and equitable indemnification  and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing 
in december  we reached an agreement with scientific atlanta the scientific atlanta settlement 
under the terms of the scientific atlanta settlement  scientific atlanta paid us million in cash and the parties jointly dismissed the litigation concerning the acquisition 
neither party admitted liability in connection with the litigation  or in the agreement resolving it 
as a result of the settlement  the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year includes benefits to cost of revenues of million and to selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
in june we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
additionally  viasat has available million of these securities  which were previously registered under a shelf registration statement viasat originally filed in september up to million of the securities may now be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities under the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 

table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations under operating leases  irrevocable letters of credit  purchase commitments and other long term liabilities for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ending total after in thousands operating leases standby letters of credit purchase commitments total we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
these agreements help the company secure pricing and product availability

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 
relating to the adoption of sfas r 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will adopt sfas r under the modified prospective transition method using the black scholes pricing model 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we will begin recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
r 
although the adoption of sfas r will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet and cash flows  it will adversely affect our net profit loss and earnings loss per share 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued financial statement of position fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas r fsp r 
fsp r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no 
r 
in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is a unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we will adopt this standard when we adopt sfas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal initially  upon adoption  we do not expect sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  the company may have equity based grants that under sfas r may result in material amount of stock based compensation expense 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and simplified method to determine the subsequent impact the accumulated 
table of contents paid in capital pool employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating this transition method 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
and sfas no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
sfas also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin states that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to an unconditional  legal obligation to perform an asset retirement obligation activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are uncertain and conditional on a future event 
if sufficient information exists for fair value measurement of the obligation  fin requires the company to recognize a liability when incurred 
the company adopted fin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operation  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
the consensus requires that the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or acquired subsequent to lease inception should be based on the lesser of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the period of the lease including all renewal periods that are reasonably assured of exercise at the time of the acquisition 
the consensus is to be applied prospectively to leasehold improvements acquired subsequent to june  this consensus is consistent with the accounting policy followed by the company and thus had no impact upon adoption 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period 
this fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations unless the property is being developed to be leased 
the guidance in this fsp shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of fsp fas will not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term obligations including the revolving line of credit 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
as of march   there was a foreign currency exchange contract outstanding intended to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros 
the foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million  consisting of both a put contract and a call contract  had a fair value of a net liability of  as of march  the fair value of this foreign currency forward contract as of march   would have changed by  if the foreign currency exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar on this forward contract had changed by
