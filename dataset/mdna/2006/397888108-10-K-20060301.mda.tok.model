item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
overview we are a leading provider of contract land drilling services in the united states with a fleet  at february   of rigs  of which rigs were marketed 
our customers include independent producers and major oil and natural gas companies 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries in the ark la tex  gulf coast  mississippi alabama  south texas  mid continent and rocky mountain drilling markets 
our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on a daywork  turnkey or footage basis see item business contracts 
our business is cyclical and our financial results depend upon several factors 
these factors include the overall demand for land drilling services  the dayrates we receive for our services  the level of demand for turnkey and footage services  our success drilling turnkey and footage wells and the demand for deep versus shallow drilling services 
new rig purchases and reactivations in early  we entered into agreements to purchase four new  horsepower rigs for a total of million that will be delivered throughout the fourth quarter of these new rigs are designed to enhance safety  increase the efficiency of rig moves  and maximize performance for our customers  who have signed three year term contracts for each of these rigs 
these term contracts should provide solid returns on the capital invested and  in the aggregate  should recover the purchase price after operating expenses 
work is underway to reactivate two of our four rigs available for refurbishment  and we intend to refurbish the remaining two rigs during the reactivation of these four rigs and purchase of the four new rigs is anticipated to increase our marketed rig count to by the end of the fourth quarter of rig activity the united states land rig count has continued to climb to levels not seen since the early nineteen eighties 
the land rig count at february  per the baker hughes rotary rig count  is over  rigs 
our average rigs working has also continued to escalate because of the demand for our services 
for the week ended february   we had an average of rigs working 
the table below shows the average number of land rigs working in the united states according to the baker hughes rotary rig count and the average number of our rigs working 
domestic land rig full full to count q q q q year q q q q year baker hughes grey wolf term contracts we have signed a number of term contracts to provide drilling services on a daywork basis 
we currently have rigs working under term contracts 
a majority of these contracts end at various times over the next twelve months providing future earnings and an opportunity to reprice at then current market rates 
we had or will have the opportunity to reprice of the term contracts in the first and second quarters of of the long term contracts that have been renewed over the past two months  the average increase in contracted revenue per rig day has been  we have approximately  days  or an average of rigs  contracted for  and  days  or an average of rigs  committed under term contracts in these contracts should provide revenue of million in and million in 
table of contents our term contracts typically range in length from one to three years and include a per rig day cancellation fee approximately equal to the dayrate under the contract less estimated operating expenses for the unexpired term of the contract 
in addition  we are able to pass the cost of any labor increases on to our customers through our dayrates on all daywork contracts  including term contracts 
drilling contract rates improvements in the level of land drilling in the united states during and have positively impacted the dayrates we are receiving for our rigs 
we saw a  per day increase in dayrates from to on average  which is a improvement 
this was the primary factor in our increase in earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda per rig day from  in to  in a rig day is defined as a twenty four hour period in which a rig us under contract and should be earning revenue 
as of february   our leading edge rates have risen to between  to  per rig day  without fuel or top drives 
in addition to our fleet of drilling rigs  we owned top drives at february   for which our rates are up to  per rig day  at that date 
rates for our top drives are in addition to the above stated rates for our rigs 
turnkey and footage contract activity turnkey and footage work is an important part of our business and operating strategy and produced record results during 
our engineering and operating expertise allow us to provide this service to our customers and has historically provided higher revenues and ebitda per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
however  we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits and risk such as loss of hole that would otherwise be assumed by the customer under daywork contracts 
in  our turnkey and footage ebitda per rig day was  compared to a daywork ebitda per rig day of  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
in  our turnkey and footage ebitda per rig day was  compared to a daywork ebitda per rig day of  and our turnkey and footage revenue was  per rig day compared to  per rig day for daywork 
for the year ended december   turnkey and footage work represented of total rig days worked compared to of total rig days worked in this percentage decrease in is due to the increase in the number of days worked under daywork contracts  as roughly the same number of days were worked under turnkey contracts in and ebitda generated on turnkey and footage contracts can vary widely based upon a number of factors  including the location of the contracted work  the depth and level of complexity of the wells drilled and the ultimate success of drilling the well 
the demand for drilling services under turnkey and footage contracts has historically been lower during periods of overall higher rig demand 
while overall rig demand has been higher as evidenced by the increase in rig count  the demand for turnkey services has not declined 
results and first quarter outlook we produced record results for revenue  net income  and ebitda for the last three consecutive quarters and completed with the best annual results in the company s history 
our revenue increased from and net income was greater than our previous high in  supported by continued strength in both turnkey and daywork operations 
an estimate of results for the first quarter of has been prepared based on current anticipated levels of activity and dayrates 
during the first quarter of  we expect to average rigs working and to generate ebitda of approximately million see reconciliation of ebitda to net income in results of operations 
we expect depreciation expense of approximately million and interest expense of approximately million in the first quarter of net income per share is expected to be approximately on a diluted basis  using a tax rate of approximately based upon the expected net income of million 
these projected results do not include an after tax gain of million per diluted share on the sale of five rigs during the first quarter of capital expenditures for the full year are projected to be million to million subject to the ultimate number or rigs purchased or returned to service during these projections are forward looking statements and while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations or the assumptions that underlie such assumptions will prove to be correct 
we expect to average between and rigs working under turnkey and footage contracts during the first quarter of  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current level of activity or the financial results we have historically derived from 
table of contents turnkey and footage contracts 
see item business forward looking statements for important factors that could cause actual results to be different materially from our expectations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require our management to make subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
however  these estimates  judgments and assumptions concern matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the accounting policies that we believe are critical are property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  revenue recognition  insurance accruals  and income taxes 
property and equipment 
property and equipment  including betterments and improvements are stated at cost with depreciation calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we make estimates with respect to the useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  the cyclical nature of our business or the introduction of new technology in the industry  could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation 
when any asset is tested for recoverability  we also review the remaining useful life of the asset 
any changes to the estimated useful life resulting from that review are made prospectively 
we expense our maintenance and repair costs as incurred 
we estimate the useful lives of our assets are between three and years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and natural gas industry 
if we determine that a triggering event  such as those described previously  has occurred we perform a review of our rig and rig equipment 
our review is performed by comparing the carrying value of each rig plus the estimated cost to refurbish or reactivate to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows for that rig 
if the carrying value plus estimated refurbishment and reactivation cost of any rig is more than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the rig  a write down of the rig to estimated fair market value must be made 
the estimated fair market value is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best estimate of fair market value  however  quoted market prices are generally not available 
as a result  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations 
the calculation of undiscounted future net cash flows and fair market value is based on our estimates and projections 
the demand for land drilling services is cyclical and has historically resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization 
we believe the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will fluctuate 
the likelihood of an asset impairment increases during extended periods of rig inactivity 
each year we evaluate our rigs available for refurbishment and determine our intentions for their future use 
this evaluation takes into consideration  among other things  the physical condition and marketability of the rig  and projected reactivation or refurbishment cost 
to the extent that our estimates of refurbishment and reactivation cost  undiscounted future net cash flows or fair market value change or there is a deterioration in the physical condition of the rigs available for refurbishment  we could be required under sfas no 
to record an impairment charge 
in  we reviewed the rigs held for refurbishment and determined to utilize the component parts of seven of these rigs as spare equipment 
the net book value of these rigs was million at december  there was  however  no impairment as a result of this decision 
below is a summary of our rig fleet and the estimated cost to refurbish and reactivate  excluding drill pipe  by category as of february  
table of contents estimated per rig refurbishment and reactivation number cost rig category of rigs excluding drill pipe marketed n a rigs being refurbished million available for refurbishment million we may also need to purchase drill pipe for these rigs based upon inventory levels at the time of reactivation 
the cost of drill pipe  at current prices  could range from  to million for each rig 
the net book value of the rigs available for refurbishment in the table above  including the rigs being refurbished  at december  was million 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of new patriot drilling corp 
patriot  which was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation of the patriot acquisition we recorded goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
the intangible assets represent customer contracts and related relationships acquired and are being amortized over the useful life of three years 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of assets of the business acquired 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets was recorded during revenue recognition 
revenues are earned under daywork  turnkey and footage contracts 
revenue from daywork and footage contracts is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
on daywork contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of days completed at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
on footage contracts  revenue is recognized based on the number of feet that have been drilled at fixed rates stipulated by the contract 
revenue from turnkey drilling contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date compared to our estimate of the total contract costs 
under percentage of completion  we make estimates of the total contract costs to be incurred  and to the extent these estimates change  the amount of revenue recognized could be affected 
the significance of the accrued turnkey revenue varies from period to period depending on the overall level of demand for our services and the portion of that demand that is for turnkey services 
at december   there were nine turnkey wells in progress versus five wells at december   with accrued revenue of million and million  respectively at such dates 
anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded at the time our estimated costs exceed the contract revenue 
insurance accruals 
we maintain insurance coverage related to workers compensation and general liability claims up to million per occurrence with an aggregate of million for general liability claims 
these policies include deductibles of  per occurrence for workers compensation coverage and  per occurrence for general liability coverage 
if losses should exceed the workers compensation and general liability policy amounts  we have excess liability coverage up to a maximum of million 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  accrued for losses incurred within the deductible amounts for workers compensation and general liability claims and for uninsured claims 
the amount accrued for the provision for losses incurred varies depending on the number and nature of the claims outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
in addition  the accrual includes management s estimate of the future cost to settle each claim such as future changes in the severity of the claim and increases in medical costs 
we use third parties to assist us in developing our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle each claim  which is based upon historical experience associated with the type of each claim and specific information related to each claim 
the 
table of contents specific circumstances of each claim may change over time prior to settlement and as a result  our estimates made as of the balance sheet dates may change 
income taxes 
we are subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of our annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when we recognize income tax expenses and benefits 
we have deferred tax assets mostly relating to workers compensation liabilities 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and we had million and million  respectively  in permanent differences which relate to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent differences will be reduced as the assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over the next seven years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our effective tax rate varies widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our statutory to effective tax rate 
financial condition and liquidity the following table summarizes our financial position as of december  and december  december  december  dollars in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment  net goodwill other noncurrent assets total long term debt other long term liabilities shareholders equity total significant changes in financial condition the significant changes in our financial position from december  to december  are an increase in working capital of million  an increase in net property and equipment of million  an increase in other long term liabilities of million  and an increase in shareholders equity of million 
the increase in working capital is primarily the result of higher balances in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable  partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued current liability balances 
the increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable are due to more rigs working and increased dayrates during and higher current income taxes payable due to higher income 
in addition  accrued liability balances are higher due primarily to accrued payroll and workers compensation costs as a result of the increase in activity 
the increase in net property and equipment is due to capital expenditures during  partially offset by depreciation 
capital expenditures of million in include the costs to reactivate rigs that were held for refurbishment  drill pipe purchases  and betterments and improvements to our rigs 
the increase in other long term liabilities is primarily due to deferred tax liabilities which increased as a result of current period net income and the use of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously included in this line 
the increase in shareholders equity is primarily due to the net income for the period and the exercise of stock options

the cit facility is a revolving facility with automatic renewals after expiration unless terminated by the lender on any subsequent anniversary date and then only upon days prior notice 
periodic interest payments are due at a floating rate based upon our debt service coverage ratio within a range of either libor plus to or prime plus to 
the cit facility provides up to million available for letters of credit 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the cit facility and letters of credit accrue a fee of per annum 
the cit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and we are in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including our drilling equipment  are pledged as collateral under the cit facility which is also secured by a guarantee of grey wolf  inc and guarantees of certain of our wholly owned 
table of contents subsidiaries 
we  however  retain the option  subject to a minimum appraisal value  under the cit facility to extract million of the equipment out of the collateral pool in connection with the sale or exchange of such collateral or relocation of equipment outside the contiguous states of the united states of america 
among the various covenants that we must satisfy under the cit facility are the following two covenants as defined in the cit facility which apply whenever our liquidity  defined as the sum of cash  cash equivalents and availability under the cit facility  falls below million to ebitda coverage of debt service  tested monthly on a trailing month basis  and minimum tangible net worth as defined in the cit facility at the end of each quarter will be at least the prior year tangible net worth less non cash write downs since the prior year end and less fixed amounts for each quarter end for which the test is calculated 
at december   our liquidity as defined above was million 
additionally  if the total amount outstanding under the cit facility including outstanding letters of credit exceeds of the orderly liquidation value of our domestic rigs  we are required to make a prepayment in the amount of the excess 
also  if the average rig utilization rate falls below for two consecutive months  the lender will have the option to request one additional appraisal per year to aid in determining the current orderly liquidation value of the drilling equipment 
average rig utilization is defined as the total number of rigs owned which are operating under drilling contracts in the contiguous states of the united states of america divided by the total number of rigs owned  excluding rigs not capable of working without substantial capital investment 
events of default under the cit facility include  in addition to non payment of amounts due  misrepresentations and breach of loan covenants and certain other events including default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of  legal judgments in excess of  or a change in control which means that we cease to own of our two principal subsidiaries  some person or group has either acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the company or obtained the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  or our board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors as defined by the cit facility 
as of the date of this report  we did not have an outstanding balance under the cit facility and had million of undrawn  standby letters of credit 
these standby letters of credit are for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for premiums and losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility 
cash flow the net cash provided by or used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below amounts in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash our cash flows from operating activities are affected by a number of factors including the number of rigs working under contract  whether the contracts are daywork  footage or turnkey  and the rate received for these services 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in ebitda and net income as a result of higher dayrates and rig activity

table of contents projected cash sources and uses we expect to use cash generated from operations to cover cash requirements  including debt service on the notes and floating rate notes and capital expenditures in we will make quarterly interest payments on the floating rate notes on january  april  july and october of each year and semi annual interest payments of million on the notes on may and november of each year through the dates of maturity 
to the extent that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations we would be required to use cash on hand or draw on our cit facility 
capital expenditures for are projected to be between million and million  subject to the actual level of rig activity and the ultimate number of new rig purchases and rig reactivations 
we expect to spend approximately million to reactivate all four of our remaining rigs held for refurbishment during each is expected to be significantly upgraded 
refurbishment of two of these rigs is currently underway with one of these rigs  horsepower projected to start work near the end of the first quarter of and another rig  horsepower expected to start work in the second quarter of we have obtained long term contracts on each of these rigs which  in the aggregate  are expected to generate revenue of approximately million over the term of the contracts 
we believe that this revenue will be sufficient to recover  after operating expenses  our capital cost of refurbishing the rigs 
we also expect to spend approximately million to purchase four new  horsepower drilling rigs to be delivered late in we have obtained long term contracts on each of these rigs which  in the aggregate  are expected to generate revenue of approximately million over the term of the contracts 
we believe that this revenue will be sufficient to recover  after operating expenses  the purchase price of these rigs 
in addition  our projected capital expenditures for include costs for betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  the purchase of top drives  and other capital items 
results of operations our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on either a daywork  turnkey or footage basis 
successfully completed turnkey and footage contracts generally result in higher revenues per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
ebitda per rig day worked on successful turnkey and footage jobs are also generally greater than under daywork contracts  although we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits that would typically be paid by the customer under daywork contracts 
contract drilling revenues and ebitda on turnkey and footage contracts are affected by a number of variables  which include the depth of the well  geological complexities and the actual difficulties encountered in drilling the well 
in the following discussion of the results of our operations and elsewhere in our filings  we use ebitda and ebitda per rig day 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure under the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
we believe that our disclosure of ebitda per rig day as a measure of rig operating performance allows investors to make a direct comparison between us and our competitors  without regard to differences in capital structure or to differences in the cost basis of our rigs and those of our competitors 
investors should be aware  however  that there are limitations inherent in using this performance measure as a measure of overall company profitability because it excludes significant expense items such as depreciation expense and interest expense 
an improving trend in ebitda per rig day may not be indicative of an improvement in our overall profitability 
to compensate for the limitations in utilizing ebitda per rig day as an operating measure  our management also uses gaap measures of performance including operating income loss and net income loss to evaluate performance but only with respect to the company as a whole and not on a per rig basis 
in accordance with sec rules  we have included below a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss  which is the nearest comparable financial gaap measure

these income and expense items are not contract related and are allocated between daywork and turnkey based upon operating rig days 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in ebitda from daywork operations and a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total ebitda increased by  or to  in from  in this increase included a  per rig day increase from daywork operations and a  per rig day increase from turnkey operations 
total general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily due to higher payroll and short term incentive costs  and professional fees 
total interest income increased by million due to higher cash balances and higher interest rates in compared to daywork operations the increase in ebitda discussed above was due in part to an increase of  or  rig days worked on daywork contracts during compared to this increase in days was due primarily to overall higher demand for our services 
higher dayrates contributed significantly to the increase in ebitda with contract drilling revenue per rig day increasing  or  however  this increase includes approximately average per rig day related to a wage increase effective june  that was passed on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
drilling operations expenses increased overall  and on a per rig day basis  due to higher activity levels  as well as several other factors 
those factors include the above mentioned wage increase  crews being kept on the payroll during unanticipated maintenance  the implementation of an employee retention program and increases in other labor costs 
in november  we implemented a two year employee retention program for our experienced rig based personnel 
the purpose of this program is to retain key operational personnel on our rigs and reduce the cost of turnover and improve safety and efficiency at the rig site 
the program had a per rig day impact on operating costs during the year ended december  and is expected to have an estimated per rig day impact on operating costs in turnkey operations turnkey ebitda per rig day increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in ebitda per rig day was due primarily to higher revenue in total and on a per rig day basis 
contract drilling revenue per rig day increased  or primarily resulting from higher daywork dayrates  which are considered in our turnkey bidding process 
also  
table of contents differences in the complexity and success of the wells drilled between the two periods contributed to the increased ebitda 
other depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense is higher due to the acquisition of patriot during the second quarter of  and capital expenditures during and for the reactivation of rigs available for refurbishment  betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  and other capital items 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the decrease is due to the issuance of the floating rate notes and subsequent redemption of our notes 
this refinancing resulted in substantial interest savings given the lower interest rate debt outstanding 
in addition  the first half of included a million redemption premium and accelerated amortization of million of deferred financing costs on the notes 
our income tax expense increased by million to million in  from million in the increase is due to the level of income and is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent difference will be reduced as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately seven years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate decreased from in to in based upon the level of income 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and our ebitda increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in ebitda from daywork operations and a million increase in ebitda from turnkey operations 
on a per rig day basis  our total ebitda increased by  or to  in from  in this increase included a  per rig day increase from daywork operations 
total general and administrative expenses increased by million due primarily to higher payroll costs  professional fees  and costs associated with being a public company 
daywork operations the increase in ebitda discussed above was due in part to an increase of  or  rig days worked on daywork contracts during compared to this increase in days was due to the acquisition of patriot and overall higher demand for our services 
higher dayrates in also contributed to the increase 
contract drilling revenue per rig day increased  or  the bulk of which also increased ebitda per day  which increased by  per rig day 
overall  drilling operations expenses increased as a result of the increase in activity but remained relatively flat on a per rig day basis 
turnkey operations days worked under turnkey contracts increased by  or  while ebitda per rig day increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in ebitda per rig day was due to differences in the mix  success and complexity of the wells drilled in compared to other depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense is higher due to the acquisition of patriot and capital expenditures during for the reactivation of rigs available for refurbishment  betterments and improvements to our rigs  the acquisition of drill pipe and drill collars  and other capital items 

table of contents interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the decrease is due to the issuance of the notes and floating rate notes and subsequent redemption of our notes 
this refinancing resulted in substantial interest savings given the lower interest rate debt outstanding 
our income tax expense increased by million to million in from an income tax benefit of million in the increase is due to the level of income and is also affected by the annual amortization of million in permanent differences related to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets that were purchased in capital stock acquisitions 
the permanent difference will be reduced as these assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives of approximately eight years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our book effective tax rate varies based upon the levels of income or loss 
inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity of the oil and natural gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and natural gas industry demand for drilling services and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation 
our daywork contracts generally allow us to pass wage increases  the most significant component of our operating costs  on to our customers in the form of higher dayrates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on the floating rate notes and the cit facility 
the floating rate notes bear interest at a per annum rate which is equal to month libor  adjusted quarterly  minus a spread of 
we had million of the floating rate notes outstanding at december  a change in the interest rate on the floating rate notes would change our interest expense by million on an annual basis 
however  the annual interest on the floating rate notes will never be below zero or more than  which could yield interest expense ranging from zero to million on an annual basis 
interest on borrowings under the cit facility accrues at a variable rate  using either the prime rate plus to or libor plus to  depending upon our debt service coverage ratio for the trailing month period 
we have no outstanding balance under the cit facility at february  and as such have no exposure under this facility to a change in interest rates
