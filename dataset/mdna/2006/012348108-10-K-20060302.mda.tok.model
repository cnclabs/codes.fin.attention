item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and assumptions the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company records sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent upon the contractual arrangement between the company and its customers 
these arrangements  which may include provisions for transfer of title and guarantees of workmanship  are specific to each customer 
sales contracts in the albany door systems segment may include product and installation services 
for these sales  the company applies the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company s contracts that include product and installation services generally do not qualify as separate units of accounting and  accordingly  revenue for the entire contract value is recognized upon completion of installation services 
the company limits the concentration of credit risk in receivables by closely monitoring credit and collection policies 
the company records allowances for sales returns as a deduction in the computation of net sales 
such provisions are recorded on the basis of written communication with customers and or historical experience 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as significant changes in the business climate  plant closures  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company performs a test for goodwill impairment at least annually 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based on short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the company has investments in other companies that are accounted for under either the cost method or equity method of accounting 
the investment accounted for under the cost method was included in other assets as of december  in  the company determined that investment to be other than temporarily impaired and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million in other expense  net  representing the full amount of the investment 
investments accounted for under the equity method are included in investments in associated companies 
the company performs regular reviews of the financial condition of the investees to determine if its investment is impaired 
if the financial condition of the investees were to no longer support their valuations  the company would record an impairment provision 
the company has pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are updated on an annual basis 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
the amount of annual pension plan funding and annual expense is subject to many variables  including the investment return on pension plan assets and interest rates 
assumptions used for determining pension plan liabilities and expenses are evaluated and updated at least annually 
discount rate assumptions are based on the population of plan participants and a mixture of high quality fixed income investments for which the average maturity approximates the average remaining service period of plan participants 
the assumption for expected return on plan assets is based on historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
the actual return on assets in the us pension plan for was greater than the assumption 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  at september   the measurement date for pension plans  the largest portion of pension plan assets for the us plan and for non us plans was invested in equities 
for the non us pension plan mortality assumption  the company uses the group annuity mortality assumption updated to the company has studied its actual mortality data for a recent six year period and found it to be consistent with that mortality table 
weakness in investment returns and low interest rates  or deviations in results from other assumptions  could result in the company making equal or greater pension plan contributions in future years  as compared to including anticipated contributions for all pension plans  the company has classified million of its accrued pension liability as a current liability at december  actual contributions for totaled million 
the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of differences between financial statement and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
a tax valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in the event it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset allowances will not be needed  the valuation allowance will be adjusted 
the company has a trade accounts receivable program whereby it sells  without recourse  certain north american accounts receivable to a qualified special purpose entity qspe  as defined under financial accounting standard no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities fas no 

the qspe is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and  in accordance with fas no 
 its financial statements are not consolidated with the financial statements of the company 
the securitization program can be terminated at any time  with thirty days notice  by the company or the unrelated third party 
if the securitization program were terminated  the company would not be required to repay cash received from the sale of accounts receivable  but no additional receivables would be sold under the program 
accounts receivable would increase as new sales were made  and the note receivable would decrease as the sold accounts receivable were collected 
the company might need to borrow from its existing credit facilities or use existing cash to fund operations until cash flow from accounts receivable returned to normal levels 
the unconsolidated subsidiary receives cash from an unrelated third party in exchange for an undivided ownership interest in the accounts receivable 
as of december   the unconsolidated subsidiary had assets of million consisting primarily of million of accounts receivables sold to it by the company  net of a million interest sold to the unrelated third party  and an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   the liabilities of the unconsolidated subsidiary were million  consisting principally of the note payable to the company  and equity was million 
the company has contingent liabilities for litigation  claims and assessments that result from the ordinary course of business 
these matters are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item overview the company is engaged in three business segments paper machine clothing  applied technologies and albany door systems 
the company s largest segment is paper machine clothing  which includes paper machine clothing and process belts pmc  which are technologically sophisticated consumable products designed  manufactured and marketed for each section of the paper machine 
the design and material composition of clothing and belts can have a considerable effect on the quality of paper products produced and the efficiency of paper machines on which they are used 
paper machine clothing and belts have finite lives and must be replaced on a regular basis 
the company invests in research and development to maintain what it believes to be its position as the technology leader in the marketplace  and to continually improve the production processes and deliver increased value to customers 
the company s operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of the world 
the applied technologies segment of the company is comprised of a wide variety of products  including fabrics  wires and belting products for the nonwovens and pulp industries engineered fabrics  specialty filtration products for wet and dry applications industrial process technologies  industrial insulation products high performance materials  primaloft patented synthetic down for the home furnishings and outerwear markets  and engineered composites and structures for the aerospace industry 
albany door systems produces and services high performance doors  which are primarily marketed to industrial and commercial enterprises requiring interior or external doors that involve either frequent openings or environmental contrasts between the two areas separated by the doors 
high performance doors open and close very rapidly  and may utilize electrical systems that assure automatic opening and closing under circumstances desired by customers 
although the company s high performance doors are marketed globally  its largest manufacturing operations are in europe and north america 
industry trends the paper machine clothing segment has experienced significant change since as consolidation and restructuring impacted the global paper and paperboard industry and reduced the number of major paper machine clothing competitors from eight to four 
albany international is the paper machine clothing market leader  with a worldwide market share of approximately for the year the market shares of each of the next largest competitors were approximately half that of albany international s market share for the year as part of the company s long term strategy to provide value to customers and to improve returns to shareholders  the company has rationalized production capacity by closing and consolidating manufacturing facilities in north america and europe 
according to published data  world paper and paperboard production volumes have grown at an annual rate of approximately over the last ten years 
of the thousands of paper machines operating in the world  the company estimates that approximately  machines represent the target market for the company s paper machine clothing products 
during the last three years  approximately paper machines in the united states and paper machines in europe have been shut down 
these machine closures have been partially offset by the start up of approximately new paper machines located around the world during the same period 
increases in paper production have a positive impact on demand for paper machine clothing  while the shutdown of paper machines  combined with increases in the efficiency of the remaining paper machines and the useful life of paper machine clothing  has a negative impact on demand 
the company anticipates continued growth for the long term in world paper and paperboard production 
although the rate of paper industry consolidation and rationalization has recently slowed  the company expects that continued rationalization and efficiency improvements in the paper industry may have a negative impact on demand 
technological advances in paper machine clothing  while contributing to the papermaking efficiency of customers  have in some cases lengthened the useful life of the company s products and reduced the number of pieces required to produce the same volume of paper 
while the company is often able to charge higher prices for its products as a result of these improvements  increased prices may not always be sufficient to offset completely a decrease in the number of fabrics sold 
although paper machine clothing segment sales were higher in as compared to  the company s net sales of paper machine clothing decreased in each of the three previous fiscal years after adjusting for currency translation effects 
the trend toward a decrease in the ratio of pmc consumed to paper produced and the recent period of consolidation and rationalization may be significant contributors to the decline in sales for  and the company s strategy for dealing with these trends is to continue to focus on providing solutions for customers through new products and services  improving the company s product mix and price structure  while at the same time identifying additional cost saving opportunities and growing sales in other industries 
challenges  risks and opportunities the paper machine clothing segment of the business is very competitive 
some competitors tend to compete more on the basis of price  while others  including the company  attempt to compete more on the basis of technical performance of products and services 
during the past three years  the company has spent an average of of its consolidated net sales on research and development  and expects to spend similar amounts in future periods 
failure to maintain or increase the product and service value delivered to customers in future periods could have a material impact on sales in this segment 
some competitors in this segment have the ability to bundle sales of pmc with other papermaking equipment 
this can result in additional discounts in their paper machine clothing 
the basic papermaking process  while it has undergone dramatic increases in efficiency and speed  has always relied on paper machine clothing 
in the event that a paper machine builder or other person were able to develop a commercially viable manner of paper manufacture that did not require paper machine clothing  sales of the company s products in this segment could be expected to decline significantly 
the applied technologies segment has experienced significant growth in net sales during the last two to three years  due to the introduction of new products and growth in demand and application of previously existing products 
while opportunities for continued growth remain excellent  there can be no assurances that the growth in sales enjoyed during the last two to three years will continue 
albany door systems derives most of its revenue from the sale of high performance doors 
the purchase of these doors is normally a capital expenditure item for customers and  as such  market opportunities tend to fluctuate with industrial capital spending 
the majority of the segment s revenues are derived from sales and manufacturing outside of the united states  which can cause the reported financial results to be more sensitive to changes in currency rates than the other segments of the company 
foreign currency albany international operates in many geographic regions of the world and has more than half of its business in countries outside the united states 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in euros or other currencies 
in some locations  the profitability of transactions is affected by the fact that sales are denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the costs to manufacture and distribute the products are denominated 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect revenues and profits as the results are translated into us dollars in the consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency or other derivative contracts in order to enhance cash flows or to mitigate volatility in the financial statements that can be caused by changes in currency exchange rates

the increase was principally due higher sales in all segments  and benefits resulting from cost reduction initiatives 
in january  the company announced a cost reduction initiative that was part of a continuing effort to match manufacturing capacity to the global demand for paper machine clothing 
the restructuring activities associated with this program were completed in approximately of cost reductions that resulted from this program were in the paper machine clothing segment  the reductions principally affected cost of goods sold 
the cost reduction initiative resulted in restructuring charges of million in and million in the charges include plant and equipment write downs of approximately million in and million in the majority of these restructuring costs related to the shut down of the company s paper machine clothing segment facilities in south carolina  france  the netherlands and discontinuation of dryer fabrics manufacturing at the facility in bury  england 
research expense increased million or percent in  principally due to professional fees associated with intellectual property 
unallocated expenses increased million to million in principally due to increases in corporate headquarters expense  including million for the company s united states postretirement medical benefits program  and million related to a long term incentive plan that was adopted in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in postretirement benefits was principally due to higher cost trend rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made several modifications to its postretirement benefits program  including increases in the cost sharing provisions and increases in the monthly contribution of plan participants 
the modifications had the effect of reducing the plan s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million  which will lower future costs of the plan in comparison to plan costs without the modifications 
interest expense declined to million for compared to million for  due to lower average debt and interest rates in during  the company s interest rate swap agreements expired that had effectively fixed the interest rate on million of debt to

paper machine clothing segment net sales in the paper machine clothing segment increased to million for as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to the increase in net sales is principally due to higher volume of pmc sales in comparison to unit pricing of pmc was mixed by product line and by geographic regions 
in the fourth quarter of  unit pricing for pmc declined in certain european markets 
the company s strategy for addressing pricing issues is to demonstrate the value its products provide to customers  such as better efficiency which reduces energy costs and improved quality of the paper products that are manufactured 
the company believes that its products should be priced in accordance with the value provided 
this strategy has been successfully implemented in the americas 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for the increase in was principally due to higher sales and the benefits resulting from cost reduction initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 
the decrease in relation to full year gross profit percentage is due to the pricing issue noted above and also due to increased material costs resulting principally from higher petroleum prices that had the effect of increasing fourth quarter cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the company expects increased material costs to have a comparable  or even greater  impact on quarterly results during operating income was million for  compared to million for  which was after restructuring charges of million 
the improvement in operating income reflects higher net sales and gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
applied technologies segment net sales in the applied technologies segment increased to million in as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to the results within this segment demonstrate that there is an excellent opportunity for growth in new markets and new applications 
the products within this segment build off the company s core strengths in advanced textiles and materials and have a higher growth rate potential than the pmc business 
the company will continue to invest in the businesses that demonstrate a sustainable basis for clearly superior performance in comparison to competitors products  and for attractive growth rates and returns on capital

gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for the decrease was principally due to lower sales in the paper machine clothing segment  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was also negatively affected by the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on export sales 
these sales are typically denominated in us dollars  while the manufacturing costs are based mainly on currencies that strengthened against the us dollar 
in  gross profit was lower by approximately million as a result of the currency effect on these export sales 
despite those negative effects  cost reduction activities helped to generate a gross profit percentage that increased during the last six months of selling  general  technical and research expenses increased in as compared to excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  these costs decreased 
in  selling and general expenses included million of remeasurement losses at certain company operations related to trade accounts receivable denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  while in  the losses were negligible 
the fact that this category of expense was relatively flat excluding currency effects  means that the company s efficiency improvements offset sharp increases in sarbanes oxley costs  as well nearly all other cost categories that were affected by general inflation

excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales decreased as compared to pricing for products in this segment was generally flat  while overall volume decreased 
in  global paper and paperboard manufacturers continued to produce more tons of product with fewer units of paper machine clothing 
several factors contributed to this trend  including enhanced pmc product performance that creates additional value for customers  more efficient paper machine operation as a result of industry consolidation and rationalization  and the practice by some paper manufacturers to run pmc products longer 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for the decrease in was principally due to lower sales excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  and the currency effect on us dollar denominated export sales

albany door systems segment net sales in the albany door systems segment increased to million in as compared to million for changes in currency translation rates had the effect of increasing net sales by million 
excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  net sales increased as compared to high performance door sales remained sluggish as increases in customers capital spending did not materialize 
approximately of the sales in were in european markets and  accordingly  results were significantly impacted by european economies 
the company provides aftermarket service and parts for high performance doors  and this revenue component grew to million in  compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to for operating income improved from a loss of million in to income of million in approximately million of the improvement was due to lower restructuring costs 
results for the full year were positively affected by efficiency improvements  new product development  and increases in aftermarket and service revenues  even though customers capital spending for high performance door products was weak in major markets 
international activities the company conducts more than half of its business in countries outside of the united states 
as a result  the company experiences transaction and translation gains and losses because of currency fluctuations 
the company periodically enters into foreign currency contracts to hedge this exposure see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the risks associated with its operations and locations outside the united states are not other than those normally associated with operations in such locations 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its business activities primarily with cash generated from operations and borrowings  primarily under the revolving credit agreement described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million of long term indebtedness to prudential securities 
company subsidiaries outside of the united states may also maintain working capital lines with local banks  but borrowings under such local facilities tend not to be significant 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared with million for  and million for cash used for restructuring was million for  million for and million for the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from to was principally due to an increase of million in cash used for restructuring charges 
accounts receivable at december   decreased million while inventories increased million as compared to december  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  accounts receivable was almost unchanged while inventories increased a total of million 
the increase in inventories is partially due to an improvement in order backlog and also reflects building product coverage for certain customers 
the company has a program whereby it may sell a portion of its north american accounts receivable to a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
additional data about this program is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this form of financing results in a lower current incremental cost of financing than the lowest rate on the company s revolving credit agreement  and it broadens the company s sources of financing 
in exchange for the accounts receivable sold  the company receives cash and a note 
the note is subject to monthly fluctuation based on the amount of receivables sold and bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   the interest rate was per annum 
the qspe receives cash from an unrelated third party in exchange for an undivided ownership interest in the accounts receivable 
as described under critical accounting policies and assumptions  in the event that the receivables program were terminated or sales to the qspe discontinued  the company would not be required to repay any amounts received  but would also not realize any cash proceeds from the collection of additional receivables sold under the program until the obligation to the third party was satisfied 
accounts receivable as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets would increase as new sales were made  and  after the qspe s obligations to the third party were satisfied  the note receivable would decrease as sold receivables were collected 
these factors would result in a decrease in reported cash flow from operations beginning in the period of termination and continuing in subsequent periods until the sold receivables were collected 
the company might need to borrow from its existing credit facilities or use available cash to make up the difference in cash generated from accounts receivable until collections from new accounts not sold under the program begin to be received 
including discrete income tax items  the effective tax rate for the full year was as compared to in and in the company currently anticipates its consolidated tax rate in will not exceed before any discrete items  although there can be no assurance that this will not change 
at december   the company s order backlog was million  a decrease of approximately from the prior year end 
however  excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates  order backlog increased in as discussed under industry trends  the paper industry has undergone major consolidation and capacity rationalization in recent years 
although sales in improved over  there can be no assurances that paper industry consolidation and rationalization is complete 
if industry consolidation and rationalization continue  it could have a negative impact on net sales as well as on cash flow from operations 
the company will continue to focus on improving the performance of its products in order to increase market share and improve its product mix and price structure  while at the same time exploring additional cost saving opportunities 
in any event  although historical cash flows may not  for all of these reasons  necessarily be indicative of future cash flows  the company expects to continue to be able to generate substantial cash from sales of its products and services in future periods 
in october  the company closed on a million borrowing from prudential capital group 
the principal is due in three installments of million each at the end of years  and for an average life of years  and the interest rate is fixed at percent 
proceeds from the borrowing were used to pay down all million of floating rate indebtedness at the time outstanding under the company s existing credit facility 
the covenants under this agreement are effectively the same as under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the borrowing was arranged directly between the company and prudential capital group and total costs associated with securing this financing were less than  the new borrowing further strengthens the company s balance sheet and provides the company with the financial flexibility to pursue shareholder value initiatives 
these initiatives include the ability to make investments in existing businesses as well as the ability to repurchase shares of the company s stock 
business investments may take the form of increased capital expenditures in the paper machine clothing segment as well as strategic acquisitions to provide growth in other businesses in which the company has a sustainable competitive advantage 
in january  the company entered into an unsecured five year million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
under the agreement  the company pays a fee of on the unused portion of the commitment  and pays interest  at variable rates based on libor  plus a spread  on the drawn portion 
the spread is determined by the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
the agreement includes a number of covenants that could limit the company s ability to purchase common stock  pay dividends  acquire other companies or dispose of its assets  and also requires the company to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than to  and a minimum interest coverage of at least to 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio was to and its interest coverage ratio was to 
the company may purchase its common stock or pay dividends to the extent its leverage ratio remains at or below to  and may make acquisitions provided its leverage ratio would not exceed to after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition 
if any bank in the lending group is unable to meet its commitment to lend  the company may be unable to borrow the full amount 
the company does not expect that any of the banks in the bank group will be unable to meet their commitments
