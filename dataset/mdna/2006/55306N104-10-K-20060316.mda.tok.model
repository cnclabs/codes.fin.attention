item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading worldwide provider of instruments  components  subsystems and process control solutions that measure  control  power and monitor critical parameters of semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes 
we are managed as one operating segment which is organized around three product groups instruments and control systems  power and reactive gas products and vacuum products 
our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control  materials delivery  gas and thin film composition analysis  electrostatic charge control  control and information management  power and reactive gas generation and vacuum technology 
our products are used to manufacture semiconductors and thin film coatings for diverse markets such as flat panel displays  optical and magnetic storage media  architectural glass and electro optical products 
we also provide technologies for medical imaging equipment 
we have a diverse base of customers that include semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  semiconductor device manufacturers  industrial and biopharmaceutical manufacturing companies  medical equipment manufacturers and university  government and industrial research laboratories 
during the years ended december   and  we estimate that approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers 
we expect that sales to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our sales 
during the latter half of and continuing into the first half of  the semiconductor capital equipment market experienced a market upturn after a downturn of almost three years 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we experienced an increase in sales 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing through the fourth quarter of  our quarterly sales were below the level of sales achieved in the second quarter of we currently expect our first quarter sales to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter of based on apparent spending trends in the semiconductor capital equipment market towards the end of the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict 
a significant portion of our net sales is to operations in international markets 
international net sales include sales by our foreign subsidiaries  but exclude direct export sales 
international net sales accounted for approximately  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  a significant portion of which were sales in japan 
we expect that international net sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  warranty costs  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets  in process research and development and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in most transactions  we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in some instances  we provide installation and training to customers after the product has been shipped 
we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is delivered 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
we monitor and track the amount of product returns  provide for accounts receivable allowances and reduce revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
while we maintain a credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continuously monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to our estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases from supply shortages or a decrease in the cost of inventory purchases as a result of volume discounts  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty costs 
we provide for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
we provide warranty coverage for our products ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and any known specific product issues 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based upon estimates 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
we review intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could indicate an impairment  include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant and negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of the asset may not be 
table of contents recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if an impairment is possible and indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the fair value initially assigned to intangible assets is determined based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill at the reporting unit level may be impaired 
reporting units are defined as operating segments or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we have determined that our reporting units are components of our one operating segment 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units at the time of acquisition and base that allocation on which reporting units will benefit from the acquired assets and liabilities 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow approach  and is dependent on estimates and judgments related to future cash flows and discount rates 
if actual cash flows differ significantly from the estimates used by management  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
in process research and development 
we value tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions  including in process research and development ipr d  at fair value 
we determine ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expense ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
the value of ipr d is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project is analyzed and estimates and judgments are made to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility and the stage of completion 
if we acquire other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and will incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
income taxes 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that may be more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we established a valuation allowance  an expense is recorded within the provision for income taxes line on the statement of operations 
during the year ended december   we established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  after examining a number of factors  including historical results and near term earnings projections  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our net deferred tax assets  except for those relating to certain state tax credits 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
in future periods  if we were to determine that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize the recorded amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total net sales of certain line items included in our consolidated statement of operations data year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangible assets restructuring and asset impairment charges income from litigation settlement income loss from operations interest income  net other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended compared to and net sales year ended december  change change in in net sales net sales decreased million during the year ended december  mainly due to a decrease in worldwide demand from our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer customers  which decreased million or compared to the same period for the prior year 
primarily offsetting this decrease was a net sales increase of million or for other non semiconductor manufacturing applications and a net sales increase of million or for semiconductor device manufacturer customers compared to the same period for the prior year 
international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales compared to million for the same period of or of net sales 
net sales increased million during the year ended december  primarily driven by stronger worldwide demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer customers  which increased million or compared to the same period for the prior year 
international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
gross profit year ended december  points change points change in in gross profit as a percentage of sales 
table of contents gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly during the year ended december  compared to the same period in mainly due to overhead costs representing a higher percentage of lower sales  partially offset by lower material and labor costs as a percentage of sales  which reflected the net effect of a gradual transition to lower cost material and manufacturing sources 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points during the year ended december  compared to the same period in of the increase in percentage points  percentage points of gross margin improvement were mainly related to overhead costs becoming a lower percentage of a higher sales volume 
the additional percentage points of gross margin improvement primarily reflected the net effect of a gradual transition to lower cost material and manufacturing sources  offset by unfavorable changes in warranty cost and product mix 
research and development year ended december  change change in in research and development expenses our research and development is primarily focused on developing and improving our instruments  components  subsystems and process control solutions to improve process performance and productivity 
we have hundreds of products and our research and development efforts primarily consist of a large number of projects related to these products  none of which is individually material to us 
current projects typically have a duration of to months depending upon whether the product is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product 
our current initiatives include projects to enhance the performance characteristics of older products  to develop new products and to integrate various technologies into subsystems 
these projects support in large part the transition in the semiconductor industry to larger wafer sizes and smaller integrated circuit geometries  which require more advanced process control technology 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants  material costs for prototypes and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period for primarily due to lower project material and other related costs 
staffing levels during were consistent with staffing levels during research and development expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period for primarily due to increased compensation expense of million as a result of higher staffing levels  restored compensation levels  salary increases and incentive compensation  million of higher project material expenses  mainly related to our power and reactive gas products  and million of increased consulting costs 
at december   we had research and development employees as compared to research and development employees at december  we believe that the continued investment in research and development and ongoing development of new products are essential to the expansion of our markets  and expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development activities 
we are subject to risks if products are not developed in a timely manner  due to rapidly changing customer requirements and competitive threats from other companies and technologies 
our success primarily depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor industry 
we develop products that are technologically advanced so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive generation of semiconductor capital equipment 
if our products are not chosen to be designed into our customers products  our net sales may be reduced during the lifespan of those products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative year ended december  change change in in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to higher costs of million primarily for it related services and for our erp implementation  increased foreign currency losses of million  higher professional fees of million principally related to higher audit costs and fees for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  partially offset by decreased legal fees of million mainly related to litigation which had been subsequently resolved 
we anticipate that the costs relating to our erp implementation  primarily depreciation  will continue to increase in  but to a lesser extent than in selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to increased compensation expense of million  as a result of restored compensation levels  salary increases  incentive compensation and higher sales commissions  million in higher legal fees related mainly to our patent infringement litigation against advanced energy  million in increased consulting fees primarily for it related services  and million in increased professional fees primarily related to compliance with sarbanes oxley 
amortization of acquired intangible assets year ended december  change change in in amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expense for the years ended december   and  respectively  represents amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from our completed acquisitions 
the decrease during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year was due to certain identifiable intangible assets becoming fully amortized during amortization expense for the year ended december  was consistent with amortization expense for the year ended december  we did not acquire any material identifiable intangible assets in  or restructuring  asset impairment and other charges year ended december  restructuring  asset impairment and other charges as a result of our various acquisitions from through and the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market which began in  we had redundant activities and excess manufacturing capacity and office space 
therefore in  and continuing through the first quarter of  we implemented restructuring activities to rationalize manufacturing operations and reduce operating expenses 
as a result  in we took a restructuring charge of million which consisted of million related to exiting leased facilities  million of severance costs related to a workforce reduction and an asset impairment charge of million 
during  we recorded restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million related to our restructuring activities 
the charges consisted of million of severance costs related to workforce reductions  million of lease costs  professional fees and other costs related to facility consolidations and an asset impairment charge of million 

table of contents during  we completed our restructuring activities related to the consolidation of operations from acquired companies when we exited an additional leased facility and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
during  we initiated a restructuring plan related to our berlin  germany location 
this consolidation of activities included the reduction of employees 
the total restructuring charge related to this consolidation was million  which consisted of million related to the repayment of a government grant and million in severance costs 
also during  we terminated a lease related to a facility previously exited 
at the date the lease was terminated  we had an accrual of approximately million related to this facility 
after making the lease settlement payment and payments for other contractual obligations  the remaining balance of approximately million was reversed as there was no remaining obligation 
a summary of the restructuring charges  asset impairments and other charges during  and  and the related accrual balance is outlined as follows workforce facility reductions other consolidations total in thousands reserve balance as of december  restructuring provision in charges utilized in reserve balance as of december  restructuring provision in charges utilized in reserve balance as of december  restructuring provision in charges utilized in reserve balance as of december  the remaining facilities consolidation obligation at december  will be paid over the remaining lease term which ends in these payments will be made out of current working capital 
the accrual for workforce reductions and lease payments is recorded in other accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
income from litigation settlement during the fourth quarter of  we executed a settlement agreement with advanced energy industries  inc advanced energy in connection with the patent infringement suit we had brought against advanced energy in federal district court in delaware 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  advanced energy paid us million in cash in october interest income  net year ended december  change change in in interest income  net net interest income increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year  mainly related to higher interest rates on higher average investment balances in those periods 

table of contents net interest income increased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year  mainly related to higher average investment balances 
other income  net year ended december  other income  net during  we sold certain assets for proceeds of approximately million  including a note receivable of approximately million and warrants of million 
during  due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer s operations  and the acquirer s inability to raise financing  we considered the value of the note and warrants to be impaired 
accordingly  during  we recorded a charge of million to other expense for our estimate of the impairment on the note receivable and warrants 
during the second quarter of  we received million and recorded a gain to other income related to the collection of the note receivable and accrued interest and the cancellation of the warrants 
during  we recorded a gain of million from the early repayment of premiums related to a split dollar life insurance policy covering our chairman and ceo 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december   as compared to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as a result of incurring significant operating losses since  during we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not have been realizable  and since the fourth quarter of had established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  after examining a number of factors  including historical results and near term earnings projections  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our net deferred tax assets  except for those related to certain state tax credits 
an adjustment was made to reduce the valuation allowance to reflect the amount of the realizable net deferred tax assets at december  the provision for income taxes in is comprised of federal  state and foreign income taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance from an increase in state tax credit carryovers for which we determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in is less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a tax benefit recorded as the result of the completion of the internal revenue service irs examination see below  the benefit from us research and development credits and the profits of our international subsidiaries being taxed at rates lower than the us statutory tax rate 
the effective tax rate for is lower than the rate due to the fact that during the fourth quarter of  after examining a number of factors  including historical results and near term earnings projections  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize all of our net deferred tax assets  except for those related to certain state tax credits 
an adjustment was made to reduce a previously recorded valuation allowance to reflect the amount of the realizable net deferred tax assets at december  the benefit for income taxes in is comprised of tax expense from foreign operations and state taxes  offset by a deferred tax benefit of approximately million 
the provision for income taxes in was comprised of tax expense from foreign operations and state taxes 
during  the irs completed its examination of our federal tax returns for the tax years through as a result of this examination  during the year ended december   we recorded a benefit to income tax expense of million and a million reduction of goodwill related to a previous acquisition 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  this increase is mainly due to an increase of million of cash generated from operations during the primary driver in our current and anticipated future cash flows is and will continue to be cash generated from operations  consisting mainly of our net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in periods when our sales are growing  higher sales to customers will result in increased trade receivables  and inventories will generally increase as we build products for future sales 
this may result in lower cash generated from operations 
conversely  in periods when our sales are declining  our trade accounts receivable and inventory balances will generally decrease  resulting in increased cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   resulted mainly from net income of million  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization and an increase in operating liabilities of million  offset by an increase in operating assets of million 
the increase in operating liabilities is primarily the result of a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in taxes payable 
the increase in operating assets is primarily the result of a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories as a result of increased production volumes in late to support higher revenues expected in the first quarter of net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net income of million  an increase in operating liabilities of million  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  offset by an increase in operating assets of million  a deferred tax benefit of million and a million gain related to the collection of a previously written off note receivable 
the increase in operating assets consisted mainly of an increase in accounts receivable of million due to increased shipments resulting in increased sales of million in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of and an increase in inventory of million as a result of increased production volumes in to support higher revenues 
the increase in operating liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million resulting from increased accrued compensation  warranty reserves  accrued professional fees and non income tax related tax accruals and a million increase in income taxes payable 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net maturities and sales of million of available for sale investments offset by the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million for investments in manufacturing equipment and for the consolidation of our it infrastructure 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net purchases of million of available for sale investments mainly from the net proceeds received from our stock offering  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million for investments in manufacturing equipment and for the consolidation of our it infrastructure  partially offset by the million proceeds received from the collection of a note receivable previously written off 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million in principal payments on long term debt and net payments of million on short term borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in net proceeds received from our common stock offering during  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  net proceeds of million from short term borrowings  offset by million of principal payments on long term debt 
on august   we renewed an unsecured short term libor based loan agreement with a bank to be utilized primarily by our japanese subsidiary for short term liquidity purposes 
the credit line  which expires on july   provides for us to borrow in multiple currencies of up to an equivalent of million us dollars 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million us dollars  payable on demand  at an interest rate of  with million available for future borrowings 

table of contents our japanese subsidiary also has credit lines and short term borrowing arrangements with a financial institution  which provide for aggregate borrowings as of december  of up to million  which generally expire and are renewed in three month intervals 
at december   total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements totaled million  at interest rates ranging from to  with million available for future borrowings 
we have provided financial guarantees for certain unsecured borrowings and have standby letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed expiration dates 
at december   our maximum exposure as a result of these standby letters of credit and performance bonds was approximately million 
future payments due under debt  lease and purchase commitment obligations as of december  in thousands are as follows payment due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years debt obligations interest on debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital leases interest in capital leases other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the majority of the outstanding inventory purchase commitments of approximately million at december  are to be purchased within the next months 
additionally  approximately million represents a commitment  as of december   to a third party engaged to provide certain computer equipment  it network services and it support 
this contract is for a period of approximately six years that began in september and has a significant penalty for early termination 
the actual timing of payments and amounts may vary based on equipment deployment dates 
however  the amount noted represents our expected obligation based on anticipated deployment 
we believe that our working capital  together with the cash anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated working capital and planned capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
during the fourth quarter of  we executed a settlement agreement with advanced energy in connection with the patent infringement suit we had brought against advanced energy in federal district court in delaware 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  advanced energy paid us million in cash in october see item legal proceedings 
on january   we completed our acquisition of ion systems  inc  a leading provider of electrostatic management solutions located in alameda  california  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated november  ion systems ionization technology controls electrostatic charge to reduce process contamination and improve yields  which complements the company s process monitoring and control technologies 
the aggregate purchase price consisted of million in cash and million in acquisition related costs 
additionally  on january   we completed our acquisition of umetrics  ab  a leader in multivariate data analysis and modeling software located in umea  sweden  pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated december  umetrics multivariate data analysis and modeling software converts process data 
table of contents into useable information for yield improvement  when linked with the company s open and modular platform of process sensors and data collection  integration  data storage  and visualization capabilities 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash and million in acquisition related costs 
to the extent permitted by massachusetts law  our restated articles of organization  as amended  require us to indemnify any of our current or former officers or directors or any person who has served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any of our employee benefit plans 
because no claim for indemnification has been pursued by any person covered by the relevant provisions of our restated articles of organization  we believe that the estimated exposure for these indemnification obligations is currently minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of december  we also enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business which include indemnification provisions 
pursuant to these agreements  we indemnify  hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party  generally our customers  for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with certain patent or other intellectual property infringement claims  and  in some instances  other claims  by any third party with respect to our products 
the terms of these indemnification obligations are generally perpetual after execution of the agreements 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is  in some instances  unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these obligations is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these obligations as of december  when  as part of an acquisition  we acquire all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company  we assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisitions  historically we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations 
in conjunction with certain asset sales  we may provide routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined 
where appropriate  an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability 
because the amounts of liability under these types of indemnifications are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale  historically we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
derivatives we conduct our operations globally 
consequently  the results of our operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales of inventory  over a maximum period of months  using forward foreign exchange contracts forward exchange contracts primarily related to japanese and european currencies 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of stockholder s equity until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings  the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales over the next twelve months is an unrealized gain of million  net of taxes 
the ineffective portions of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales and were immaterial in  and  respectively 
we also hedge certain intercompany and other payables with forward exchange contracts 
typically  as these derivatives hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies  the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foreign exchange gain or loss on these derivatives was immaterial in  and 
table of contents realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in earnings 
the cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified in our statements of cash flows as investing activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december   of which  million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
we had forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december  of which million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december  of which million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a gain of million for the year ended december  and loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships

this statement is effective as of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents and expect to use the modified prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of sfas r 
although we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas r and its implications on our employee benefit plans  we believe that the adoption of this standard  based on the terms of our options outstanding at december   will have a material effect on net income in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and sensitivity analysis our primary exposures to market risks include fluctuations in interest rates on our investment portfolio  short and long term debt as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange rate risk we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively 
of such forward exchange contracts  million and million  respectively  were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars with the remaining amounts relating to contracts to exchange the british pound and euro for us dollars 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in the forward currency exchange rate on our forward exchange contracts at december  and would be million and million  respectively 
the potential losses in and were estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december  and and comparing that with those calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
at december  we had million in loans outstanding between subsidiaries that were subject to foreign exchange exposure 
at december  a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net transaction loss of million that would be recorded in current earnings 
subsequent to december   we initiated a plan to convert approximately million of these loans to equity which will reduce the loan balance to approximately million 
we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts to further reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to these remaining loans 
at december   we had million related to short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt denominated in japanese yen 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to their short period to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the japanese yen to us dollar year end exchange rate  the fair value of these short term borrowings would increase by million 
the potential increase in fair value was estimated by calculating the fair value of the short term borrowings at december  and comparing that with the fair value using the hypothetical year end exchange rate 
at december   we had million related to short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt denominated in japanese yen 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to their short period to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the japanese yen to us dollar year end exchange rate  the fair value of these short term borrowings would increase by million 
the potential increase in fair value was estimated by calculating the fair value of the short term borrowings at december  and comparing that with the fair value using the hypothetical year end exchange rate 
interest rate risk due to its short term duration  the fair value of our cash and investment portfolio at december  and approximated its carrying value 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair 
table of contents value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying values 
our total long term debt outstanding  including the current portion  at december  and  was million and million  respectively  and consisted mainly of a mortgage note and industrial development revenue bond 
the interest rates on these debt instruments are primarily variable and range from to at december  and to at december  due to the immaterial amounts of the outstanding debt  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  mks has outstanding short term borrowings with variable interest rates  primarily denominated in japanese yen 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  outstanding related to these short term borrowings at interest rates ranging from to 
due to the short term nature and amount of this short term debt  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations
