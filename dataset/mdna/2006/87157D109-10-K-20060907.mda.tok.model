risk factors 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed user interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
through our proprietary touchpad  we are the world s leading supplier of interface solutions to the notebook computer market 
with our touchstyk  we offer oems the choice of a touch pad  a pointing stick  or a combination of both of our proprietary interface solutions for dual pointing applications 
we believe our market share results from the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to design products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but declined to million in fiscal despite the decline from fiscal to fiscal  our revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  we derived of our product revenue from the personal computer market 
in fiscal  revenue from the personal computer market accounted for of our net revenue 
in june  we acquired nsm technology limited  or nsm  a hong kong company 
the acquisition of nsm provided us with a highly skilled and experienced work force to expand our global presence and infrastructure to support customers in the asia pacific region 
many of our customers are migrating their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and our oem customers are beginning to establish design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in taiwan  hong kong  korea  japan  and china  we are better positioned to provide local sales  operations  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  within the asia pacific region 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and drop ship our products directly to our customers from our manufacturing subcontractors facilities  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our manufacturing subcontractors to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our manufacturing subcontractors with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our manufacturing subcontractors 
currently  we use two third party manufacturers to provide our proprietary asics  and in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  manufacturing  assembly and test costs paid to third party manufacturers  and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  all warranty costs  yield losses  and any inventory provisions or write downs are charged to cost of revenue 

table of contents our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost improvement programs 
these cost improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products  which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost improvement programs 
as a result  new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin 
our research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering  materials costs  patent expenses  and the costs incurred to design interface solutions for customers prior to the customers commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in our existing markets and to develop new technologies for new markets 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  sarbanes oxley act compliance  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  primarily reflecting increased corporate governance costs related to sarbanes oxley act compliance  staffing  commission expense associated with higher revenue levels  and additional management personnel in anticipation of our continued growth in our existing markets and penetration into new markets 
in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and consultants  we have recorded deferred stock compensation  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the dates of grant 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
options granted are typically subject to a four year vesting period 
we amortized the deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options and recorded expense associated with deferred stock compensation of approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r in fiscal  we ceased amortizing deferred stock compensation  as fas r required us to expense share based compensation costs based on grant date fair value 
the adoption of fas r had no effect on our cash flows  but did result in a million charge to our operating income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of revenue  inventories  product warranty  provision for income taxes  income taxes payable  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  applicable laws  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates  interpretations  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain when estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably 
table of contents assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances  based on historical experience  at the time we recognize revenue  which is typically upon shipment 
we record contract revenue for research and development as the services are provided under the terms of the contract 
we recognize non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist and for which there is no continuing involvement by us on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
sudden declines in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the following factors influence our estimates changes to or cancellations of customer orders  unexpected decline in demand  rapid product improvements and technological advances  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically  we purchase inventory from our subcontractors when a customer s delivery schedule is delayed or a customer s order is cancelled 
in those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our subcontractors  we consider a write down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
write downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete  slow moving  and non usable inventory to net realizable value are charged to cost of revenue 
share based compensation costs we account for employee share based compensation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee share based compensatory awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical and implied volatility were used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards  while the expected life for our options was estimated to be five years based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
we charge the estimated fair value to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock option and deferred stock unit awards and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option and employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and guidance 
there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 

table of contents income taxes we recognize federal  foreign  and state current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  foreign  and state deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and our judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax contingencies 
however  our results have in the past  and could in the future  include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period an assessment is made or resolved or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation 
accordingly  our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards associated with our share based compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and deferred stock unit awards  but under current accounting standards we cannot recognize tax benefit currently for share based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of sfas r  we recognize tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur and  for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of sfas r  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
accordingly  because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock  and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to estimate reasonably our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is greatly diminished

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  which is predicated on capital preservation and liquidity and consists primarily of government backed securities and investment grade instruments  we would not expect the fair value of our investments to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates  however  our interest income will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes

there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to june  foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenue  cost of revenue  and expenses  except those expenses directly related to our local operations in asia pacific and europe  are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if our operations change and we determine that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to mitigate such risk
