table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
segment information appearing below in this discussion and analysis  and in note of our consolidated financial statements  is presented in accordance with sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
overview we are one of the world s leading providers of software and solutions for interactive and enhanced television 
we derive our revenues from the licensing of our core software and related technologies  the licensing and distribution of our content and applications and the delivery of professional services 
we typically receive one time royalty fees from manufacturers of set top boxes or from network operators once a set top box  which incorporates our software  has been shipped to  or activated by  the network operator 
in january  we announced a subscription based licensing agreement under which we would receive monthly payments for each set top box embedded with our software that our customer deployed  for so long as those set top boxes remain active 
as we pursue additional subscription based pricing  our revenue model may change over time 
we also receive ongoing licensing fees for various other software products that we sell 
in addition  we receive professional services fees from consulting  engineering and training engagements  fees for the maintenance and support of our products and fees from revenue sharing arrangements related to the use of our interactive content and applications 
as of december   liberty media corporation s total ownership represented approximately of the economic interest and of the voting interest of our ordinary shares on an undiluted basis 
recent events in january  sun microsystems exchanged its  class b shares of our subsidiary  opentv inc  for the same number of class b ordinary shares of opentv corp 
as of february   sun s ownership of our class b ordinary shares  therefore  represented approximately of the economic interest and of the voting power of our ordinary shares  and liberty media s beneficial ownership of our class a and class b ordinary shares represented approximately of the economic interest and of the voting power of our ordinary shares 
sun has the right  at any time  to convert its class b ordinary shares into our class a ordinary shares on a one for one basis  in the event that sun determined to sell its interest in the public markets  we would expect sun to convert its class b ordinary shares into class a ordinary shares  which are publicly traded 
we also amended and restated our memorandum of association in february among the changes we made  we eliminated a restriction that had prohibited us from issuing additional class b ordinary shares or options  rights or warrants to subscribe for additional class b ordinary shares 
we also deleted provisions that formerly required each class b ordinary share to automatically convert into a class a ordinary share  with only one vote per share  under certain circumstances  including sales of those class b ordinary shares to persons who were not stockholders prior to our initial public offering 
and  finally  in connection with  and as a condition to  those amendments  we entered into a letter agreement with liberty media 
in that agreement  liberty media generally agreed that if it sells any of our class b ordinary shares to a third party for a sales price above the trading price of our class a ordinary shares  then liberty media will contribute to us a proportionate percentage of any premium it receives from that sale  which reflects liberty media s relative economic not voting ownership in us 
we provided a more complete description of these events in our current report on form k that we filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting polices and estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  valuation of investments in privately held companies  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  and restructuring costs 
all of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  that have been prescribed for the software industry  the principal policies of which are reflected in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue to recognize currently and which portions to defer 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
as indicated  we provide a comprehensive suite of professional engineering and consulting services on a worldwide basis in support of our product offerings 
such services may include one or more of the following middleware porting  customization  implementation and integration  the design  development or construction of software and systems  and system maintenance and support 
professional services from software development contracts  customization services and implementation support are recognized generally on the percentage of completion basis in accordance with the provisions of sop if a contract involves the provision of multiple elements  total estimated contract revenues are allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
in the event that fair value is not determinable for each service element of a multiple element contract  the contract is considered to be one accounting unit 
if it is reasonably assured that no loss will be incurred under the arrangement  we recognize service revenues using the percentage of completion method using a zero profit methodology until the contract accounting services are complete 
if the arrangement includes the future delivery of specified future software products  we recognize revenue on the completed contract method  upon delivery of the services and such specified deliverables 
if total costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 

table of contents for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is complete 
the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if other assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently  we maintain a partial valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
adjustments may be required in the future if it becomes more likely than not that an amount of deferred tax assets is realizable 
valuation of investments in privately held companies we have invested in equity and debt instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic objectives  and typically we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks of these investments 
we perform periodic reviews of these investments for impairment 
our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investee s operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value that is other than temporary and that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  need for additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value  which is the amount we believe is recoverable from the investment 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill  property and equipment  other assets and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and in the case of goodwill  annually 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we monitor our organizational structure and associated operating expenses periodically 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken to restructure the business  including terminating employees  abandoning excess lease space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs include numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected  the cost to exit existing commitments and fair value estimates 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  which provides the views of the staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations for public companies 
in april  the sec adopted a rule that amends the compliance dates of sfas no 
r 
under the revised compliance dates  we will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r no later than the first interim period of fiscal while management continues to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements  we currently believe that the expensing of share based compensation will most likely affect our consolidated statements of operations in a manner generally consistent with our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 as amended 
in march  the fasb ratified the measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
in june  the fasb directed its staff to issue proposed fasb staff position fsp eitf a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue no 
 as final 
the fasb plans to retitle this fsp as fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the final fsp will supersede eitf issue no 
and eitf topic d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
the final fsp will replace the guidance set forth in paragraphs through of eitf issue no 
with references to existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
in september  the fasb decided to retain the paragraph in the proposed fsp pertaining to the accounting for debt securities subsequent to an other than temporary impairment and added a footnote to clarify that the proposed fsp does not address when a debt security should be designated as non accrual or how to subsequently report income on a non accrual debt security 
the fasb decided that the transition would be applied prospectively and the effective date would be reporting periods beginning after december  although management is currently evaluating the potential effects that adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance in fsp fas will have on our consolidated financial statements  we do not currently anticipate that adoption of fsp fas will materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
under previous guidance  changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative effect in the net income of the period of the change 
the new statement requires retroactive application of changes in accounting principle  limited to the direct effects of the change  to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  this statement requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle  and that the correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and the correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls in connection with the preparation of our year end financial statements  we have prepared a report  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  which evaluates our internal control over financial reporting as of december  that complete report  as well as our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our 
table of contents disclosure control and our remediation efforts  is included under item a of this annual report on form k  which investors should read in its entirety 
we are required to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
those controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap 
and while those controls may be expected to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of our financial reporting  we do not expect that such controls will prevent all error and fraud 
we monitor our controls and maintain those controls as dynamic systems that change including improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 
we also maintain a system of disclosure controls that have been designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file under the securities exchange act  including this annual report on form k  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission 
as we assessed our internal control over financial reporting  we have sought to identify various deficiencies or weaknesses that we may have and to correct those deficiencies or weaknesses as promptly as practicable 
we are required to disclose any material weaknesses that we have identified 
the public company accounting oversight board  which was established under the sarbanes oxley act  defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  those weaknesses generally related to ineffective control over our account analysis for certain financial statement accounts  including accruals  long term other assets and deferred tax assets  and our lack of sufficient internal personnel with adequate technical expertise to analyze effectively  and review in a timely manner  our accounting for revenue and income taxes 
based on those findings  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  we also concluded that  as a result of those material weaknesses  our disclosure controls  as of december   were not effective 
we also identified material weaknesses in our report for that was included in our annual report on form k for while we were able to remediate aspects of the weaknesses we identified in  there is a certain overlap in several of the weaknesses we identified in and  as described more fully in item a of this annual report 
years ended december    and revenues in  we simplified our revenue classifications to present revenues from licensed products under the line item royalties and licenses  and revenues from services under the line item  services and other 
in light of that change  we have also reclassified line items for and to provide a consistent presentation 
these reclassifications did not affect our financial results or financial position in any of the periods presented 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in royalties and licenses accounted for of revenues in  in  and in revenues by line item were as follows in millions year ended december  royalties and licenses services and other total revenues royalties and licenses 
we generally derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software 
royalties are paid by either the set top box manufacturer or by the network 
table of contents operator depending upon our payment arrangements with those customers 
we recognize royalties upon notification of unit shipments or activation of our software by manufacturers or network operators 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon delivery of the software  provided all the criteria of sop and related accounting principles have been met 
while we have historically realized revenues through one time royalty payments and ongoing license fees  we recently signed a licensing agreement with an india based satellite and cable television provider that will pay us under a subscription based model  pursuant to which we are paid a monthly fee for each set top box that is deployed by the network operator for so long as that box remains in use by the operator 
we expect  in the future  to seek additional licensing arrangements of this nature  which  if we are successful  may affect our revenues over a period of time 
we also derive license fees from the licensing of other software products  such as opentv streamer and opentv software developers kit 
license fees are generally one time purchases by our customers and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our royalties usually result from several different types of arrangements 
these may include initial deployments by new customers  the activation of new subscribers by existing customers  the shipment of additional set top boxes as replacements for older set top boxes  for defective set top boxes or for purposes of simply upgrading existing set top boxes  or sales of new products or services by the network operators that require new or updated set top boxes 
as we discuss in more detail below  we have historically provided various types of volume discounts to our customers and expect that we will continue to do so in the future 
unless we are able to offset anticipated discounts through a change in product mix  upgrades to our software or other methods which typically enable us to charge higher fees  we may experience slower royalty growth as discounting is triggered 
specific royalty trends associated with set top box deployments by our customers are difficult to discern in many cases  as we do not control or directly influence actual deployment schedules of our customers 
royalties and licenses for increased to million compared to royalties and licenses for europe  middle east and africa decreased by million from to million in  principally as a result of million less in royalties and licenses revenues from sky italia in the decrease in revenues from sky italia resulted from a reduction in the royalty rate paid by sky italia over the course of  which related to volume discounts we offered sky italia when it became a customer 
the decrease from sky italia was partially offset by an increase of million in royalties and licenses revenue for bskyb  primarily as a result of increased set top box shipments by the four manufacturers who manufacture set top boxes for bskyb  and an increase of million in royalties and licenses revenues from other customers in the region 
royalties and licenses in the americas region increased by million to million in approximately million of that increase was realized from echostar  with the remaining million realized from other customers 
despite this increase in the amortization of echostar payments during  total revenues from echostar were affected  in part  by a reduction in echostar set top box shipments in compared to royalty payments we receive from echostar are amortized over the seven year term of our echostar agreements because echostar has a right to receive a limited number of unspecified future applications developed by us 
until we are able to recognize the full royalty revenue reported by echostar  which would occur upon expiration of the seven year agreement term  a portion of the amounts that we invoice to echostar are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement 
royalties and licenses in the asia pacific region increased by million to million in royalties and licenses from shipments of our integrated browser in certain digital tv sets distributed within japan accounted for million of this increase  while other customers accounted for the remaining million

table of contents increased by million from to million in increased shipments of our integrated browser in certain digital tv sets distributed within japan accounted for million of this increase  which was partially offset by decreased royalty and license revenue of million attributable to other customers 
services and other 
services and other revenues consist primarily of professional services  maintenance and support  training  service usage fees and revenue shares and programming fees 
professional service revenues are generally derived from consulting engagements for set top box manufacturers  network operators and system integrators 
maintenance  support and training revenues are generally realized as services are provided to set top box manufacturers and network operators 
the decision by a set top box manufacturer to purchase maintenance and support from us largely depends on whether such manufacturer is actively shipping set top boxes with our software or reasonably expects to do so in quantities large enough to justify payment of these amounts  which  in both cases  is dependent upon such manufacturer s supply contracts with network operators and set top box demand by the network operator 
service usage fees and revenue shares are generally derived from our playjam games channels  our betting and gaming channels  and revenue shares for advertising and other interactive services 
we also derive programming fees from our nascar agreement and from other programmers 
services and other revenue for increased by to million compared to we experienced an increase of million in net betting and gaming fees from customers of our wholly owned subsidiary  bettingcorp  due to increased service usage on bskyb 
we also realized an increase of million in advertising related service revenue from our acquisition of cam systems in september  as further described in note of our consolidated financial statements  which was partially offset by decreased advertising related service revenues of million from other advertising customers 
in  we did not recognize any programming fees for nascar 
as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  we renegotiated our nascar agreement in  and  as a result  we recognized million of additional revenue from providing these programming services in we also realized an increase of million in services from other customers to which we provided professional services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in playjam games channel fees resulting from increased competition and a reduction of service on our playjam games channel in france that we initiated 
we also experienced a decrease of million in consulting work for motorola in service and other revenue for decreased by to million compared to we experienced a decrease of million in our consulting service engagements  including a million reduction in work from motorola  for which certain minimum commitments expired in the first quarter of  and a decrease of million in maintenance and support fees  due to certain customers not renewing their maintenance agreements 
in addition  our advertising and programming fees from our wink product offering accounted for a decline of million and our playjam games channel fees decreased by million due to competitive pressures  which offset favorable currency exchange rates 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in net betting and gaming fees from customers of bettingcorp  due to the inclusion of its results for the full year of compared with five months of  and an increase of million from revenue shares for various other product offerings 
individuals who play games on the playjam games channel in the united kingdom make payments to their telecommunications provider  which provides a return path to enable the games to be interactive

nascar amendment 
during the second quarter of  we renegotiated an existing contract that our subsidiary  actv  had with indemand relating to the production of interactive programming for the nascar season and beyond 
as a result of this renegotiation  we reduced the estimated loss for that contract by million from the amount which had been accrued by actv in prior to our acquisition of actv 
this item was shown as a separate line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  no revenue or expenses were recorded prior to the renegotiation in as a result of the overall estimated losses expected under the assumed relationship 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of headcount and headcount related overhead costs incurred for both new product development and enhancements to our range of software and application products 
we believe that research and development spending is critical to remain competitive in the marketplace 
we will continue to focus on the timely development of new and enhanced interactive television products for our customers  and we plan to continue investing at levels that are adequate to develop our technologies and product offerings

table of contents general and administrative expenses for increased from to million 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in compared to in in  there was an increase in litigation expenses of million  resulting principally from patent litigation

the calculation of those tax loss carryforwards is a complex matter and may require a reassessment from time to time  which could result in changes to that estimate 
notwithstanding those federal tax loss carryforwards  we are subject to income taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and we have foreign taxes withheld from certain royalty payments

as part of that management change  we reorganized our reporting units to provide management with better information for allocating the company s resources and assessing performance in accordance with the new management team s strategic focus 
our management assesses our results and financial performance  and prepares our internal budgeting reports  on the basis of three segments the middleware and integrated technologies business  the applications business  and the bettingcorp business 
we have prepared this segment analysis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our middleware and integrated technologies business includes our middleware products and the related technologies that are customarily integrated as extensions of that middleware 
our applications business includes our playjam  advanced advertising and nascar products and related technologies 
our bettingcorp business includes our fixed odds and other wagering gaming applications  the development and operation of our ultimate one platform and the marketing of our evolving participation tv product that is based on the ultimate one technology 
our management reviews and assesses the contribution margin of each of these segments  which is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
we define contribution margin  for these purposes  as segment revenues less related  direct or indirect  allocable costs  including headcount and headcount related overhead costs  consulting and subcontractor costs  travel  marketing and network infrastructure and bandwidth costs 
there are significant judgments management makes with respect to the direct and indirect allocation of costs that may affect the calculation of contribution margins 
while management believes these and other related judgments are reasonable and appropriate  other persons could assess such matters in ways different than the company s management 
contribution margin is a non gaap financial measure which excludes unallocated corporate overhead  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill  impairment of intangibles  other income  minority interest  restructuring provisions  and unusual items such as contract amendments that mitigated potential loss positions 
these exclusions  including unallocated corporate overhead costs  income tax and interest  result in a definition of contribution margin that does not take into 
table of contents account the substantial costs of doing business 
management believes that segment contribution margin is a helpful measure in evaluating operational performance for our company 
unallocated corporate overhead costs include headcount and headcount related overhead costs  consulting and subcontractor costs  travel  legal and audit costs not considered directly allocable to individual business segments 
while we may consider contribution margin to be an important measure of comparative operating performance  this measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  loss from operations  net loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are otherwise presented in our financial statements 
in addition  our calculation of contribution margin may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be affected 
because these segments reflect the manner in which management reviews our business  they necessarily involve judgments that management believes are reasonable in light of the circumstances under which they are made 
these judgments may change over time or may be modified to reflect new facts or circumstances 
segments may also be changed or modified to reflect technologies and applications that are newly created  or that change over time  or other business conditions that evolve  each of which may result in reassessing specific segments and the elements included within each of those segments 
revenues by segment were as follows in millions year ended december  middleware and integrated technologies royalties and licenses services and other subtotal middleware and integrated technologies applications royalties and licenses services and other subtotal applications bettingcorp royalties and licenses services and other subtotal bettingcorp total revenues middleware and integrated technologies revenues from the middleware and integrated technologies business for increased from to million 
in  revenues from the middleware and integrated technologies business increased from to million 
in and  increased royalties and licenses offset a decline in services and other revenues 
royalties and licenses from set top box shipments and other product sales accounted for of segment revenues in  in and in royalties and licenses from the middleware and integrated technologies business account for the majority of our overall royalties and licenses  and increased in and due to the additional shipments and amortization described under royalties and licenses above 
services and other consists primarily of professional services consulting engagements for set top box manufacturers  network operators and system integrators and maintenance  support and training 
this category accounted for of segment revenues in  a decrease from in  and a decrease from in 
table of contents the decrease was due to fewer professional services projects  primarily due to the discontinuance of ongoing services to motorola in applications revenues from the applications business for increased to million 
in  revenues from the applications business decreased to million 
for  playjam games fees accounted for of segment revenues  a decrease from in we experienced a decrease of million in playjam games channel fees in as a result of competitive pressures and a reduction of our playjam games offerings in france that we initiated in advertising revenue increased million in  of which million was attributable to increased royalties and licenses and million was attributable to increased services and other revenue 
nearly all of that million increase was due to the acquisition of cam systems in september  as further described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we did not recognize any programming fees for nascar in as described above  we renegotiated our nascar production agreement in and  as a result  recognized million of additional revenue for this service in revenues from the applications business for were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in for  playjam games channel fees accounted for of the applications segment revenues 
our playjam games channel fees decreased by million from to due to competitive pressures  which offset favorable currency exchange rates 
in addition  there were decreases in revenue related to the customers acquired with the acquisition of wink 
bettingcorp revenues from the bettingcorp business for increased to million 
this increase was primarily due to increased service usage on bsky and due to increases in professional services from other customers 
revenues from the bettingcorp business for were million higher than in  primarily as a result of including financial information for bettingcorp for the full year in contribution margins by segment total contribution margin by segment  as reconciled to net loss on a gaap basis  was as follows in millions year ended december  contribution margin middleware and integrated technologies applications bettingcorp total contribution margin unallocated corporate overhead nascar amendment bskyb contract amendment directtv market development costs restructuring and impairment costs 
table of contents year ended december  depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets amortization of share based compensation interest income other income expense minority interest impairment of intangible assets loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss middleware and integrated technologies total contribution margin for the middleware and integrated technologies business increased in both and  primarily as a result of higher revenues in each year  which were only partially offset by increased costs in that segment 
middleware and integrated technology costs consist primarily of headcount and headcount related overhead costs and consulting and subcontractor costs associated with billable professional services engagements 
applications total contribution loss for the applications business improved in  primarily as a result of increased revenues  including revenues from our acquisition of cam systems  as described above 
contribution loss for the applications business improved significantly from to due mostly to reduced operating expenses 
bettingcorp total contribution loss for the bettingcorp business increased in although revenue increased as described above  associated bandwidth and revenue shares increased proportionately  in addition to other operating expenses 
contribution loss for the bettingcorp business increased from to as a result of bettingcorp s inclusion in our financial results for the full year in deferred revenue when we apply our revenue recognition policy  we must determine what portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred  principally in terms of sop  sop and sab in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate valuation for those products and services 
beginning in  we entered into multiple element arrangements for products and services with customers including ugc which has been acquired by liberty global  foxtel  austar  partitv and comcast 
portions of the amounts that we have invoiced to ugc  foxtel and austar under those agreements have been deferred and will be included as revenue over time in our middleware and integrated technologies business 
portions of those amounts that we have invoiced to comcast under our agreement with comcast will be included as revenue over time in our applications business 
portions of the amounts that we have invoiced to partitv under our agreements with them will be included as revenue over time in our bettingcorp business 
the arrangements with these customers included maintenance and support  for which evidence of fair value did not exist 
in addition  several of these arrangements provided for the delivery of specified future products  for which evidence of fair value also did not exist 
all revenues under arrangements for which we are obligated to provide specified future products are initially deferred 
upon final delivery of all specified products under each arrangement  we will recognize revenue either over the remaining contractual period of support or over the remaining period during which maintenance and support is expected to be provided 
as we noted above in our discussion of royalties  our echostar royalty revenues  which are included as revenues in 
table of contents our middleware and integrated technologies business  are also being amortized over the seven year term of our echostar agreements  with a portion of those reported royalty amounts currently reflected in our deferred revenue amounts 
as of december   we recorded million in deferred revenue compared with million at the end of of that total deferred amount at december   million  or  was deferred as a result of the arrangements with echostar  ugc  foxtel  austar  partitv and comcast described in the preceding paragraphs 
these deferred amounts as of december  do not reflect any additional future middleware deployments or additional license sales 
the remaining million  or  of our deferred revenue as of december  was principally attributable to other maintenance and support and professional services arrangements with other customers  which are typically short term in nature 
based on our current estimates of final delivery for all specified products  we expect the following recognition of the million of unearned revenue at december  resulting from the echostar  ugc  foxtel  austar  partitv and comcast arrangements expected recognition year ending december  of unearned revenue in millions thereafter as noted in our critical accounting policies  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
as a result  the actual revenue recognized from these arrangements  and the timing of that recognition  may differ from the amounts identified in this table 
while management believes that this information is a helpful measure in evaluating the company s performance  investors should understand that unless  and until  the company is actually able to recognize these amounts as revenue in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that the conditions to recording that revenue will be satisfied 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television market in general will prove to be accurate  our funding requirements may differ from our current expectations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which was an increase of million from the prior year 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
taking into account short term and long term marketable debt securities of million  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  the mix of cash and short term and longer term securities may change in the future as we make decisions regarding the composition of our investment portfolio 
our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue 
the primary uses of cash are payroll  general operating expenses and cost of revenues 
our cash balances as of december  were positively affected by a million increase in cash from investing activities  which included million in cash received from the sale of a private cost investment and by net cash generated from operating activities of million 
our cash balances as of december   were positively affected by million in cash from the sale by the former owners of bettingcorp of opentv shares they had received in the acquisition of bettingcorp at a price above that which the company had guaranteed  and the release from escrow of million that had previously secured our obligations under that price guarantee we had provided bettingcorp 

table of contents cash generated from operating activities was million for  compared with cash used in operating activities of million for and million for increased revenues and reduced operating expenses resulted in a significantly reduced net loss for in addition  favorable working capital movements also improved operating cash flows by million  primarily as a result of increased deferred revenues of million which offset other working capital changes of million 
in and  cash uses were primarily for our continuing operating losses  including restructuring payments 
for  net cash provided from investing activities was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million from the sale of a private cost investment 
in addition  net sales of marketable debt securities of million were used to fund the million cash portion of our acquisition costs for the cable tv advertising assets of cam systems  and to also fund capital equipment expenditures for our company 
for  net cash provided from investing activities was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million from the bettingcorp liquidity guarantee described above 
in  million was used for capital expenditures 
cash provided from investing activities was million for  primarily due to the sale of marketable debt securities 
in  uses of cash included million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
for  cash provided from financing activities was million due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for  cash provided from financing activities was million due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a capital contribution to fund management retention payments from our former controlling stockholder  mih limited 
we use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
the portfolio consists of highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities of the united states government and agencies  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit that predominantly have maturities of less than three years 
all investments are made in accordance with our written investment policy  which has been approved by our board of directors 
commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions due in due in due in due in or total after operating leases obligations noncancellable purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have the right to terminate  without penalty  two of our operating leases prior to their scheduled expiration 
if we exercised those early termination rights  our future minimum lease commitments would be reduced by an aggregate of million over the current remaining life of those leases  beginning in we have not yet made any determination as to whether we intend to exercise any of those rights 
if we did exercise any such rights  while our commitments under those specific leases would be reduced  we might also be required to lease additional space to conduct our business and we cannot be certain  at this time  whether any such actions would possibly result in a net increase in our future minimum lease commitments 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for bandwidth  marketing  and other services 
future minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million and million for the years ending december  and respectively 
in addition  we also have arrangements with certain parties that provide for revenue sharing payments 

table of contents as of december   we had three standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued to landlords and sublessee at two of our leased properties  against which two certificates of deposit aggregating million and approximately million of restricted cash were pledged as collateral 
on september   we acquired substantially all of the cable tv advertising inventory management assets of cam systems  llc and its affiliates in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
under the terms of that acquisition  the sellers and we agreed to adjust the number of shares issued under specified circumstances 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have determined that no adjustments will be required to the purchase price based on the trading value of our class a ordinary shares through the adjustment period 
indemnification in the normal course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers  subject to limitations  against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations  although our liabilities in those arrangements are customarily limited in various respects  including monetarily 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities  investments in privately held companies and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands valuation of valuation of valuation of valuation of fair value as securities if securities if securities if securities if of december  interest rates interest rates interest rates interest rates decrease increase decrease increase marketable debt securities the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
a majority of our worldwide customers are invoiced and make payments in united states dollars  with the remainder invoiced by our non united states business units under contracts that require payments to be remitted in local currency 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we regularly assess foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations 
we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  options in hedging foreign currency exposures  or other hedging procedures  during we expect over time  however  that a more significant number of our european customers may seek to pay us in euros  which may affect our risk profile and require us to make use of appropriate hedging strategies 
while we anticipate a certain portion of our revenues in will be paid to us in euros  we do not believe that such payments will require a material change in our existing hedging policies
