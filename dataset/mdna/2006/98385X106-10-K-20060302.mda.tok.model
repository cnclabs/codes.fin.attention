item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regarding recent price fluctuations and their effect on our results 
business strategy the primary components of our business strategy are acquiring long lived  operated oil and gas properties  including undeveloped leases  increasing production and reserves through efficient management of operations and through development  exploitation and exploration activities  hedging a portion of our production to provide adequate cash flow to fund our development budget and protect the economic return on development projects and acquisitions  and retaining management and technical staff that have substantial experience in our core areas 
acquiring long lived  operated properties 
we seek to acquire long lived  operated producing properties that contain complex multiple producing horizons with the potential for increases in reserves and production  produce from nonconventional sources  including tight natural gas reservoirs  coal bed methane and natural gas producing shale formations  are in core operating areas or in areas with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics  and provide opportunities to improve operating efficiencies 
we believe that the properties we acquire provide opportunities to increase production and reserves through the implementation of mechanical and operational improvements  workovers  behind pipe completions  secondary recovery operations  new development wells and other development activities 
we also seek to acquire facilities related to gathering  processing  marketing and transporting oil and gas in areas where we own reserves 
such facilities can enhance profitability  reduce costs  and provide marketing flexibility and access to additional markets 
the ability to successfully purchase properties is dependent upon  among other things  competition for such purchases and the availability of financing to supplement internally generated cash flow 
we also seek to acquire undeveloped properties that potentially have the same attributes as targeted producing properties 

table of contents increasing production and reserves 
a principal component of our strategy is to increase production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and low risk development 
we believe that our principal properties possess geologic and reservoir characteristics that make them well suited for production increases through drilling and other development programs 
we have generated an inventory of between  and  identified potential drilling locations 
additionally  we review operations and mechanical data on operated properties to determine if actions can be taken to reduce operating costs or increase production 
such actions include installing  repairing and upgrading lifting equipment  redesigning downhole equipment to improve production from different zones  modifying gathering and other surface facilities and conducting restimulations and recompletions 
we may also initiate  upgrade or revise existing secondary recovery operations 
exploration activities 
during  we plan to focus our exploration activities on projects that are near currently owned productive fields 
we believe that we can prudently and successfully add growth potential through exploratory activities given improved technology  our experienced technical staff and our expanded base of operations 
we have allocated approximately million of our billion development budget for exploration activities 
hedging activities 
to reduce production price risk  we may enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
our policy is to consider hedging a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits provided by predictable  stable cash flow  including ability to more efficiently plan and execute our development program  which facilitates predictable production growth  ability to help assure the economic return on acquisitions  ability to enter long term arrangements with drilling contractors  allowing us to continue development projects when product prices decline  more consistent returns on investment  and better utilization of our personnel 
experienced management and technical staff 
most senior management and technical staff have worked together for over years and have substantial experience in our core operating areas 
bob r 
simpson  a founder  chairman and chief executive officer of the company  was previously an executive officer of southland royalty company  one of the largest us independent oil and gas producers prior to its acquisition by burlington northern  inc in other strategies 
we may also acquire working interests in nonoperated producing properties if such interests otherwise meet our acquisition criteria 
we attempt to acquire nonoperated interests in fields where the operators have a significant interest to protect  including potential undeveloped reserves that will be exploited by the operator 
we may also acquire nonoperated interests in order to ultimately accumulate sufficient ownership interests to operate the properties 
we also attempt to acquire a portion of our reserves as royalty interests 
royalty interests have few operational liabilities because they do not participate in operating activities and do not bear production or development costs 
royalty trusts and publicly traded partnerships 
we have created and sold units in publicly traded royalty trusts 
sales of royalty trust units allow us to more efficiently capitalize our mature  lower growth properties 
we may create and distribute or sell interests in additional royalty trusts or publicly traded partnerships in the future 
business goals 
in january  we announced a strategic goal for of increasing production by to over levels 
to achieve this growth target  we plan to drill about  net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in 
table of contents we have budgeted billion for our development program  which is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
we plan to spend approximately million in the eastern region  million in the north texas region  million in the permian and south texas region  million in the san juan region and million in the mid continent and rocky mountain region and other areas and approximately million for exploration and acreage leasing activities 
an additional million has been budgeted for the construction of pipeline  compression and processing infrastructure that is critical to the transportation and sale of production in several operating regions 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  issuance of public or private debt or equity  or asset sales 
strategic property acquisitions during may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
our total budget for acquisitions  development and exploration will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 
we also may reevaluate our budget and drilling programs in the event of significant changes in oil and gas prices 
our ability to achieve production goals depends on the success of our planned drilling programs or property acquisitions made in place of a portion of the drilling program 
raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs 
although drilling rigs have recently been in short supply throughout the industry  we have secured or contracted to secure the rigs necessary to support our current drilling program

reserves the following terms are used in our disclosures of oil and natural gas reserves

proved reserves estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which  upon analysis of geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 

table of contents proved undeveloped reserves proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
estimated future net revenues also referred to herein as estimated future net cash flows 
computational result of applying current prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by existing contractual arrangements  other than hedge derivatives to estimated future production from proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves 
present value of estimated future net cash flows the computational result of discounting estimated future net revenues at a rate of annually 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows after income tax is also referred to herein as standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or standardized measure

while the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company  the pre tax discounted amount is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies 
because of this  the pre tax discounted amount can be used within the industry and by securities analysts to evaluate estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis 
the difference between the standardized measure and the pre tax discounted amount is the discounted estimated future income tax of billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  miller and lents  ltd  an independent petroleum engineering firm  prepared the estimates of our proved reserves and the future net cash flows and related present value attributable to proved reserves at december   and as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  such proved reserves were estimated using oil and gas prices and production and development costs as of december of each such year  without escalation 
none of our natural gas liquid proved reserves are attributable to gas plant ownership 

table of contents estimated future net cash flows  and the related discounted present value  of year end proved reserves are significantly higher than at year end because of increased reserves related to acquisitions and development and higher gas  natural gas liquids and oil prices used in the estimation of year end proved reserves 
year end average realized prices used in the estimation of proved reserves were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
year end product prices were per mcf for gas  per bbl for natural gas liquids and per bbl for oil 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimated proved reserves 
uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as change in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates 
during  we filed estimates of oil and gas reserves as of december  with the us department of energy on form eia and form eia these estimates are consistent with the reserve data reported for the year ended december  in note to consolidated financial statements  with the exception that form eia includes only reserves from properties that we operate 
exploration and production data for the following data  gross refers to the total wells or acres in which we own a working interest and net refers to gross wells or acres multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by us 
although many wells produce both oil and gas  a well is categorized as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of oil to gas production

the effect of hedging on gas prices was to lower realized prices by in  in and in the effect of hedging on oil prices was to lower realized prices by in  in and in delivery commitments under a production payment sold in  we have committed to deliver bcf bcf net to our interest beginning approximately september delivery of the committed volumes is in east texas 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s production and reserves are adequate to meet this delivery commitment 
competition and markets we compete with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of our business  including acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases  marketing of oil and gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and our standards established for minimum projected return on investment 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gathering systems 
competition is also presented by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil  imported liquified natural gas and other fossil fuels 
because of the long lived  high margin nature of our oil and gas reserves and management s experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves  management believes that it effectively competes in the market 
federal and state laws and regulations there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with existing laws often is difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific laws and regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and certain sales for resale of natural gas  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  are subject to federal regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january   and none of our gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
on august   congress enacted the energy policy act of the energy policy act  among other things  amended the natural gas act to prohibit market manipulation by any entity  to direct ferc to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce  and to significantly increase the penalties for violations of the natural gas act  the natural gas policy act of  or ferc rules  regulations or orders thereunder 
we cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 

table of contents although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from our properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing our production or on our gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
we  however  do not believe that we will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of our oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
these rules have had little effect on our oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operation of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled 
we may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
one of our gathering subsidiaries is designated a gas utility and is subject to such state regulations 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering similar regulations 
new regulations have not had a material effect on the operations of our gathering systems  but we cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on our gathering systems 
federal  state or native american leases our operations on federal  state or native american oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws relating to protection of the environment directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact our operations and costs 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  emissions to the atmosphere  discharges of pollutants into waters of the united states  underground injection of waste water  the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of waste materials  and protection of public health  natural resources and wildlife 
these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance and for any contamination resulting from our operations and may require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
in some jurisdictions  the laws and regulations are constantly being revised  creating the potential for delays in development plans 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released onto or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released by prior operators of properties we are acquiring as well as by current third party operators of properties in which we have an ownership interest 
properties impacted by any such disposal or releases could be subject to costly and stringent investigatory or remedial requirements under environmental laws  some of which impose strict  joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  including 
table of contents the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law and analogous state laws 
we are committed to environmental protection and believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we routinely obtain permits for our facilities and operations in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations 
there are no known issues that have a significant adverse effect on the permitting process or permit compliance status of any of our facilities or operations 
we have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with environmental regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal  recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance with government regulations 
we do not anticipate that we will be required under current environmental laws and regulations to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations 
however  due to continuing changes in these laws and regulations and judicial construction of same  we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future costs of complying with these governmental requirements 
we have been able to plan for and comply with new initiatives without materially changing our operating strategies 
we maintain levels of insurance customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden  unanticipated and accidental discharges of oil  produced water or other substances 
we are not fully insured against all environmental risks  and no coverage is maintained with respect to any penalty or fine required to be paid by us 
future laws and regulations the oil and gas industry is highly regulated and  from time to time  congress and state legislatures consider broad and sweeping policy changes that may affect the industry 
we cannot predict the impact of such future legislative or regulatory initiatives

item a 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the following discussion of our risk factors should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors  and any decline will adversely affect our financial condition 
our results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
we sell most of our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids at current market prices rather than through fixed price contracts 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
the prices we receive depend upon factors beyond our control  which include political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  such as current conditions in the middle east  nigeria and venezuela  weather conditions  the supply of domestic and foreign oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  the level of consumer demand  worldwide economic conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities  and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures 
government regulations  such as regulations of natural gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of oil and natural gas 
to the extent we have not hedged our production  any decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely affects our financial condition 
if the oil and gas industry experiences significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned capital expenditures 

table of contents our use of hedging arrangements could result in financial losses or reduce our income 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  we have entered into and expect in the future to enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
in addition  these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in oil and natural gas prices 
we have substantial capital requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  exploration and abandonment of our oil and natural gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public and private equity and debt offerings 
lower oil and natural gas prices  however  would reduce our cash flow and could affect our access to the capital markets 
costs of exploration and development were billion in  million in and million in during  we spent billion on proved property acquisitions 
our exploration and development budget for is billion 
an additional million has been budgeted for the construction of pipeline  compression and processing infrastructure in we believe that  after debt service  we will have sufficient cash from operating activities to finance our exploration and development expenses through if revenues decrease  however  and we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing  we may lack the capital necessary to replace our reserves or to maintain production at current levels 
we have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt 
any failure to meet our debt obligations would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we have incurred substantial debt 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest  which will reduce the amount available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
our bank revolving credit indebtedness is at a variable interest rate  and so a rise in interest rates will generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate protection hedges 
the amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
together with our subsidiaries  we may incur substantially more debt in the future 
the indentures governing our outstanding public debt do not contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness 
to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels  the risks resulting from indebtedness could substantially increase 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors  many of which we are unable to control 
if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt  we may be required to refinance the debt  sell assets or sell shares of common stock on terms that we do not find attractive if it can be done at all 
further  our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under the indebtedness  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and some of our competitors have greater financial  technological and other resources than we have 
we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition  development  exploitation  exploration and production 
the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
we face intense competition from independent  technology driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our oil and natural gas production  integrating new technologies  and seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties 
some of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours  and some of them are fully integrated oil companies 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
further  these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
the failure to replace our reserves could adversely affect our financial condition 
our future success depends upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves generally decline when oil and natural gas are produced unless we continue to conduct successful exploitation or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
we may not be able to economically find  develop or acquire additional reserves 
furthermore  while our revenues may increase if oil and natural gas prices increase significantly  our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
to prepare estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows  we analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this annual report 

table of contents you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves shown in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the earlier net present value estimate  and as a result  net present value estimates using current prices and costs may be significantly less than the earlier estimate which is provided in this annual report 
property acquisitions are a component of our growth strategy  and our failure to complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy may be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing or regulatory approvals 
our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
acquisitions are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due in part to acquisitions of producing properties  and we expect acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not allow us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties  and we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 
our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited 
we generally are not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  on acquisitions 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
if material breaches are discovered by us prior to closing  we could require adjustments to the purchase price  or  if the claims are significant  we or the seller may have a right to terminate the agreement 
we could also fail to discover breaches or defects prior to closing and incur significant unknown liabilities  including environmental liabilities  or experience losses due to title defects  for which we would have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage 
there are risks in acquiring producing properties  including difficulties in integrating acquired properties into our business  additional liabilities and expenses associated with acquired properties  diversion of management attention  and costs of increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
increasing our reserve base through acquisitions is an important part of our business strategy 
our failure to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing business  or the expense incurred in consummating future acquisitions  could result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses 
in addition  we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions 
the scope and cost of these obligations may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with future acquisitions  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 

table of contents possible future acquisitions could result in our incurring additional debt  contingent liabilities and expenses  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
drilling oil and natural gas wells is a high risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 
drilling oil and natural gas wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs 
we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 
the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and operating wells 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  restricted access to land for drilling or laying pipeline  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  and costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  tubular materials and equipment 
the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities over which we may have no control 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons  or may not be available to us in the future 
for example  during  we experienced temporary curtailments of our natural gas production in the san juan basin and in east texas due to infrastructure limitations and plant closings for maintenance reasons 
we are subject to complex federal  state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the oil and gas industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production  and our storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons  are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and natural gas wells and other related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection  reports concerning operations  and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  reclamation costs  remediation and clean up costs  and other environmental damages 

table of contents although we believe that our operations generally comply with applicable laws and regulations  failure to comply could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
further  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business or cause us to limit or curtail some of our operations 
we currently own  lease or expect to acquire  and have in the past owned or leased  numerous properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas for many years 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes were taken for disposal 
in addition  petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed or released by prior operators of properties that we are acquiring as well as by current third party operators of properties in which we have an ownership interest 
properties impacted by any such disposal or release could be subject to costly and stringent investigatory or remedial requirements under environmental laws  some of which impose strict joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
these laws include the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as cercla or the superfund law  the federal resource conservation and recovery act and analogous state laws 
under these laws and any implementing regulations  we could be required to remediate contaminated properties and take actions to compensate for damages to natural resources 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury or property damages allegedly caused by the release of petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment 
we currently do not expect any remedial obligations imposed under environmental laws to have a significant effect on our operations 
our operations in the coastal waters of cook inlet of alaska are subject to the federal oil pollution act  which imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in united states waters 
the oil pollution act imposes strict joint and several liability on responsible parties for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages  including natural resource damages 
liability limits for offshore facilities require a responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
these liability limits do not apply  however  if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party  if the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operation regulation  or if the party failed to report the spill or cooperate fully in any resulting cleanup 
the oil pollution act also requires a responsible party at an offshore facility to submit proof of its financial ability to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with oil pollution act requirements 
the department of transportation  through the office of pipeline safety and research and special programs administration  has implemented a series of rules requiring operators of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines to develop integrity management plans for pipelines that  in the event of a failure  could impact certain high consequence areas 
these rules also require operators to conduct baseline integrity assessments of all applicable pipeline segments located in the high consequence areas 
we are currently in the process of identifying all of our pipeline segments that may be subject to these rules and are developing integrity management plans for all covered pipeline segments 
we do not expect to incur significant costs in achieving compliance with these rules 

table of contents our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses  and insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect us against these risks 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  pressure forcing oil or natural gas out of the wellbore at a dangerous velocity coupled with the potential for fire or explosion  weather  failure of oilfield drilling and service tools  changes in underground pressure in a formation that causes the surface to collapse or crater  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we do not insure against the loss of oil or natural gas reserves as a result of operating hazards or insure against business interruption 
losses could occur from uninsurable or uninsured risks  or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist activities and military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope  and the united states and others instituted military action in response 
these conditions caused instability in world financial markets and generated global economic instability 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action  including us military operations in afghanistan and iraq  will likely lead to continued volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices and could affect the markets for our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states 
the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs

grynberg v 
cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the us district court for the western district of oklahoma by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the us false claims act against the company and certain of our subsidiaries 
the plaintiff alleges that we underpaid royalties on natural gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans in amounts in excess of as a result of mismeasuring the volume of natural gas  incorrectly analyzing its heating content and improperly valuing the natural gas during at least the past ten years 
the plaintiff seeks treble damages for the unpaid royalties with interest  attorney fees and expenses  civil penalties between  and  for each violation of the us false claims act  and an order for us to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices 
this lawsuit against us and similar lawsuits filed by grynberg against more than other companies have been consolidated in the united states district court for wyoming 
in october  the court granted a motion to dismiss grynberg s royalty valuation claims  and grynberg s appeal of this decision was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction in may the parties have completed discovery regarding whether the plaintiff has met the jurisdictional prerequisites for maintaining an action under the us false claims act 
in june  we joined with other defendants in filing a motion to dismiss  contending that the plaintiff has not satisfied the jurisdictional requirements to maintain this action 
a hearing on this motion occurred in march  and in may  the special master  who was appointed by the district judge to expedite matters and make recommendations to the district judge in the case  issued a report and recommendation to dismiss the case against some of the defendants but to retain jurisdiction of the case involving us and other defendants 
we and the other defendants filed motions to modify the special master s report  requesting the district judge to also dismiss the case as to us and other defendents 
the district judge heard oral arguments on december   as to all motions seeking adoption  modification or reversal of the special master s report  and we are awaiting the decision of the district court 
while we are unable to predict the outcome of this case  we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements 
in june  we were served with a lawsuit styled price  et al

gas pipelines  et al 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against us and one of our subsidiaries  along with over natural gas transmission companies  producers  gatherers and processors of natural gas 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas working interest owners  overriding royalty owners and royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or who received economic benefit from the sale of such gas since january  the allegations in the case are similar to those in the grynberg case  however  the price case broadens the claims to cover all oil and gas leases other than the federal and native american leases that are the subject of the grynberg case 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have mismeasured both the volume and heating content of natural gas delivered into their pipelines  resulting in underpayments to the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs assert a breach of contract claim  negligent or intentional misrepresentation  civil conspiracy  common carrier liability  conversion  violation of a variety of kansas statutes and other common law causes of action 
the amount of damages was not specified in the complaint 
in february  we  along with one of our subsidiaries  were dismissed from the suit and another subsidiary of the company was added 
a hearing was held in january  and the court held that a class should not be certified 
the plaintiffs counsel has filed an amended class action petition  which reduces the proposed class to only royalty owners  reduces the claims to mismeasurement of volume only  conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming 
the court held an evidentiary hearing in april to determine whether the amended class should be certified  and we are awaiting the decision of the court

the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against natural gas pipeline owners and operators 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or measured natural gas since january  to the present 
the new petition alleges the same improper analysis of gas heating content that had previously been alleged in the price case discussed above until it was removed from the case by the filing of the amended class action petition 
in all other respects  the new petition appears to be identical to the amended class action petition in that it has a proposed class of only royalty owners  alleges conspiracy  unjust enrichment and accounting  and only applies to gas measured in kansas  colorado and wyoming

v 
jm huber corp 
and xto energy inc the action was filed in the district court of la plata county  colorado against us and jm huber corporation 
the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants deducted in their calculation of royalty payments expenses of compression  gathering  treatment  dehydration  or other costs to place the natural gas produced in a marketable condition at a marketable location 
the plaintiffs sought to represent a class consisting of all lessors and their successors in interest who own or have owned mineral interests located in la plata county  colorado and that were leased to or operated by huber or us  except to the extent that the lessors or their successors expressly authorized deduction of post production expenses from royalties 
we acquired the interests of huber in producing properties in la plata county effective october   and assumed the responsibility for certain liabilities of huber prior to the effective date  which included liability for post production deductions made by huber 
as of december   based on an evaluation of available information  we accrued a million estimated liability for this claim in our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we agreed to a settlement of million  resulting in an additional loss of approximately million that was recorded in our consolidated income statement for on june   the court entered a final judgment approving the settlement on a class wide basis 
the final judgment releases xto from any royalty claims concerning post production costs relating to the properties 
no appeals from the final judgment were filed  so the litigation is concluded 
we paid this settlement in august on march   the division of air quality of the department of environmental conservation of the state of alaska issued us a notice of violation regarding nitrogen oxide emissions from one of our cranes that exceed the limitations of our operational permit for one of our platforms in the cook inlet of alaska 
in february  the division of air quality proposed a fine of less than  which we are discussing with them 
we are involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data  and the consolidated financial statements at item a 
unless otherwise indicated  throughout this discussion the term mcfe refers to thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent quantities produced for the indicated period  with oil and natural gas liquid quantities converted to mcf on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six mcf 
overview our business is to produce and sell natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil from our predominantly southwestern and central us properties  most of which we operate 
because our gathering  processing and marketing functions are ancillary to our production of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil  we have determined that our business comprises only one industry segment 
in  we achieved the following record financial and operating results average daily gas production was  mcf  a increase from  average daily oil production was  bbls  a increase from  and average daily natural gas liquids production was  bbls  a increase from year end proved reserves were tcfe  a increase from year end net income was billion  a increase from  and earnings per basic common share was  a increase from cash flow from operating activities was billion  a increase from stockholders equity was billion  a increase from year end the debt to capitalization ratio improved to at year end from at year end we achieve production and proved reserve growth primarily through producing property acquisitions  followed by low risk development generally funded by cash flow from operating activities 
funding sources for our acquisitions include proceeds from sales of public and private equity and debt  bank borrowings and cash flow from operating activities 
maintaining or improving our debt to capitalization ratio is a primary consideration in selecting our method of acquisition financing 
during  we acquired billion of proved properties with proved reserves of bcf of natural gas  million bbls of natural gas liquids and million bbls of oil 
in a trend that began in and accelerated during  commodity prices for natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil increased significantly see significant events  transactions and conditions product prices 
the higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
drilling rig counts are at levels not seen since the last boom in the early s and labor to run the rigs is in short supply 
this was further aggravated by the damage in the gulf of mexico as a result of the august and september hurricanes see significant events  transactions and conditions gulf of mexico hurricanes 
these cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also our capital costs 
with the increased activity  there is also increased demand for oil and gas properties which has resulted in higher acquisition prices 
like all oil and gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of natural production decline 
an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil and gas it produces 
despite this natural decline  we have been able to grow our production through acquisitions and drilling  adding more reserves than we produce 
we also attempt to manage our natural decline by combining the acquisition of mature properties with shallower decline rates with the drilling of new wells that have higher decline rates 
this has allowed us to keep our natural decline rate lower than the industry average 
future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 

table of contents our goal for is to increase production by to 
to achieve future production and reserve growth  we will continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our criteria  and to complete development projects included in our inventory of between  and  identified potential drilling locations 
our development budget is billion 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during we cannot ensure that we will be able to find properties that meet our acquisition criteria and that we can purchase such properties on acceptable terms 
raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs 
although drilling rigs have recently been in short supply throughout the industry  we have secured or contracted to secure the rigs necessary to support our current drilling program 
the increased activity in the oil and gas producing industry has also had an effect on our ability to hire qualified people including not only field operators and drillers  but also all classifications of industry specific professionals 
we continue to find the employees we need to adequately staff our operations  however  the cost of hiring and the time to fill positions has increased since our employee turnover continues to remain low with total turnover of in and in in the event that our operating cash flow exceeds our development  exploration and acquisition capital needs  we will consider other alternative uses for this cash including  but not limited to  debt repayment or stock repurchases 
in august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or negotiated transactions 
as of december    shares have been repurchased under this authorization 
in january  the board of directors declared a dividend of units of hugoton royalty trust for each share of our common stock outstanding on april  as a result of this dividend  all million trust units owned by us will be distributed to our stockholders on may  the dividend ratio is subject to change based on our outstanding share count on the record date 
based on the january  declaration date  this dividend has a fair value of approximately million  or per common share 
sales prices for our natural gas and oil production are influenced by supply and demand conditions over which we have little or no control  including weather and regional and global economic conditions 
to provide predictable production growth  we may hedge a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive to ensure stable cash flow margins to fund our operating commitments and development program 
as of february  we have hedged approximately of our first quarter projected gas production at an average nymex price of per mcf  and of our last nine months projected gas production at an average nymex price of per mcf  and about of our crude oil production at an average nymex price of per bbl 
our average realized price on hedged production will be lower than these average nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments 
the combined effect of higher product prices  a increase in gas production and a increase in oil production resulted in an increase in total revenues to billion in from billion in on an mcfe produced basis  total revenues were in  a increase from in 
table of contents we analyze  on an mcfe produced basis  expenses that generally trend changes in production increase decrease production taxes  transportation and other depreciation  depletion and amortization accretion of discount in asset retirement obligation general and administrative  excluding stock based incentive compensation interest production expense per mcfe rose primarily because of the increase in oil production  which is more expensive to produce than natural gas 
increased maintenance and labor costs and the higher cost of gas used for fuel also contributed to higher production expense 
taxes  transportation and other expense generally is based on product revenues  and the increase in this expense per mcfe is primarily caused by increased product prices 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization per mcfe resulted from higher acquisition  development and infrastructure costs 
the increase in general and administrative expense per mcfe is because of increased personnel and other costs related to company growth 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production include stock based incentive compensation 
this is a component of general and administrative expense and primarily relates to performance shares that vest when the common stock price reaches specified target levels 
incentive compensation was million in  a decrease from the comparable expense of million 
included in incentive compensation is million of cash compensation related to vesting of cash equivalent performance shares 
otherwise  stock based incentive compensation was non cash 
decreased incentive compensation is because performance shares were not awarded to the executive officers named in the proxy

as required by sfas no 
revised  as of january   we will begin recognizing compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements related to the estimated fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  granted in and after 
in addition  we will record compensation expense of million in related to the estimated fair value of unvested stock awards outstanding at december  derivative fair value gain loss 
this is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
the net derivative fair value gain was million in compared to a million loss in in  a million gain primarily related to natural gas basis swap agreements not qualifying for hedge accounting was partially offset by a loss on the btu swap contracts 
the derivative loss in was primarily attributable to the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility with commercial banks and public and private offerings of equity and debt 
we attempt to balance variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest cost  interest rate volatility and financing risk see liquidity and capital resources financing

acquisitions 
we acquired proved and unproved properties at a total cost of billion per year in and and million in  which were funded by a combination of proceeds from sales of common stock and senior notes  bank borrowings and cash flow from operating activities

the acquisition is subject to typical post closing adjustments 

table of contents  and development and exploration programs 
gas development focused on the eastern and north texas regions during and on the eastern and mid continent regions in and oil development was concentrated primarily in the permian region during all three years 
development costs totaled billion in  million in and million in exploration activity in was primarily drilling and geological and geographical analysis  including seismic studies of underdeveloped properties in the north texas region 
exploration activity in was primarily geological and geophysical analysis  including seismic studies of undeveloped properties 
exploration activity in consisted primarily of drilling successful wells in the eastern region 
exploratory costs were million in  million in and million in our development and exploration activities are generally funded by cash flow from operations 
acquisition  development and exploration program 
we have budgeted billion for our development and exploration program  which we expect to fund using cash flow from operations 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to continue to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  public or private issuance of debt or equity  or asset sales 
the cost of property acquisitions may alter the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
our total budget for acquisitions  development and exploration will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 
as of december   we have an inventory of between  and  identified potential drilling locations 
we plan to drill about  net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in drilling plans are dependent upon product prices 
product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other conditions we generally cannot control or predict 
gas 
natural gas prices are affected by weather  the us economy  the level of north american production  crude oil prices and import levels of liquified natural gas 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
since late  gas prices have generally been increasing due primarily to increased demand and declining north american production 
these trends accelerated in the second half of due to the effects of hurricanes on gulf of mexico production 
during the last half of and the first two months of  gas prices have ranged from a high in excess of per mmbtu to a low of almost per mmbtu 
we expect prices to remain volatile 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to gas price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average gas prices for the last three years year ended december per mcf average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging at february   the average nymex gas price for the following months was per mmbtu 
as computed on an energy equivalent basis  our proved reserves were natural gas at december  after considering hedges in place as of february   we estimate that a per mcf change in the average gas sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow before income taxes 

table of contents oil 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
since late  oil prices have generally been rising primarily because of increasing global demand and supply shortage concerns  inadequate refining capacity  reduced production as a result of tropical storms and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and political instability 
oil prices increased to record levels in august  exceeding per bbl 
we expect oil prices to remain volatile 
as described under hedging activities below  we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
the following are comparative average oil prices for the last three years year ended december per bbl average nymex price average realized sales price average realized sales price excluding hedging at february   the average nymex oil price for the following months was per bbl 
after considering hedges in place as of february   we estimate that a per barrel change in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow before income taxes 
gulf of mexico hurricanes 
in late august and september  hurricanes in the gulf of mexico disrupted a significant portion of us oil and gas production  leading to higher and more volatile commodity prices 
the company s field operations and production were substantially unaffected by these hurricanes 
production expense and development costs  however  have increased throughout the industry because of storm damages and related supply shortages and higher insurance costs 
hedging activities 
we may enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts  to hedge our exposure to product price volatility 
our policy is to consider hedging a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits of predictable  stable cash flows 
in  all hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million  while in  all hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million 
in  hedging activities decreased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million 
the following summarizes our january through december nymex hedging positions as of february  excluding basis adjustments which are separately hedged 
our average daily production was  mcf of gas and  bbls of oil in fourth quarter prices to be realized for hedged production will be less than these nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments

derivative fair value gain loss 
we record in our income statements realized and unrealized derivative fair value gains and losses related to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting  as well as the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives 
we recorded a net derivative fair value gain of million in  and net losses of million in and million in the gain includes a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses 
the loss includes a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses 
the loss includes a million loss on the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  or approximately of total hedge derivative losses 
these ineffective hedge derivative losses are primarily because of increasing oil and gas prices and their effect on hedges of production in areas without corresponding basis or location differential swap contracts 

table of contents derivative fair value gain loss includes a net loss related to our btu swap contracts of million in  million in and million in the remaining portion of these contracts was terminated as of february   resulting in a net btu swap contract gain of approximately million in first quarter unrealized derivative gains and losses associated with effective cash flow hedges are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   we have an unrealized pre tax gain of million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of gas and crude oil price risk 
this fair value gain is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the actual reclassification to earnings will be based on mark to market prices at contract settlement date

see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased million  or  primarily because of a increase in the weighted average borrowings to partially fund property acquisitions 
interest expense per mcfe increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings against the revolving credit facility  occasional proved property sales and private or public offerings of equity and debt 
other than for operations  our cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
we believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to fund our cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared with cash provided by operating activities of billion in and million in increased cash provided by operating activities from to and from to was primarily because of higher prices and increased production from acquisitions and development activity 
cash provided by operating activities was decreased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in and million in and was increased by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities are primarily the result of timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
cash provided by operating activities was also reduced by exploration expense of million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities is largely dependent upon the prices received for oil and gas production

financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of company growth related to acquisitions and development 
as of december   total capitalization was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was billion  of which was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is primarily because of our earnings 
working capital we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under our loan agreements see financing below 
because of this  and since our principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
working capital improved from a negative position of million at december  to working capital of million at december  excluding the effects of derivative fair value and deferred tax current assets and liabilities  working capital increased million from a negative position of million at december  to a negative position of million at december  this increase is because of increased accounts receivable related to increased revenues partially offset by increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily related to increased production and drilling liabilities 
any cash settlement of hedge derivatives should generally be offset by increased or decreased cash flows from our sales of related production 
therefore  we believe that most of the changes in derivative fair value assets and 
table of contents liabilities are offset by changes in value of our oil and gas reserves 
this offsetting change in value of oil and gas reserves  however  is not recorded in the financial statements 
when the monthly cash settlement amount under our hedge derivatives is calculated  if market prices are higher than the fixed contract prices  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while this payment will ultimately be funded by higher prices received from sale of our production  production receipts lag payments to the counterparties by as much as days 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
most of our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
we currently have greater concentrations of credit with several a or better rated integrated energy companies 
financial and commodity based futures and swap contracts expose us to the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to the contracts 
this exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions  and we have master netting agreements with counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts 
letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security are obtained as considered necessary to limit risk of loss 
financing in april  we entered into an amended and restated five year senior revolving credit agreement with commercial banks with an initial commitment amount of billion  which may be increased by us  subject to certain approvals  to a maximum of billion 
the agreement requires us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than 
we use the facility for general corporate purposes and as a backup facility for possible future issuance of commercial paper 
the maturity date on the facility is april   with annual options to request successive one year extensions 
on december   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were million  with unused borrowing capacity of million 
the weighted average interest rate of at december  is based on the one month london interbank offered rate plus 
also in april  we entered into an amendment to our million term loan credit agreement 
the amendment conforms the term loan covenants to the covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement 
in april  we sold million of senior notes at of par to yield to maturity 
the notes mature in june and interest is payable each june and december net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce borrowings under our bank revolving credit facility 
our outstanding debt is currently rated by both standard poor s and moody s 
the current ratings from both agencies are investment grade 
in february  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to potentially offer securities which could include debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants to purchase debt or stock 
the total face amount of securities that can be offered is billion  at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
net proceeds from the sale of such securities will be used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of bank debt 
the april senior notes were sold under this registration statement 
capital expenditures in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled billion compared with million in we have budgeted billion for the development and exploration program and an additional million for the construction of pipeline infrastructure and compression and processing facilities 
as we have done historically  we expect to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
we have the flexibility to adjust our actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of our acquisition and development programs 
raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and cause prices to remain high 
in response  we have increased our tubular inventory and have negotiated supply contracts with our vendors to support our development program 
while we expect to acquire adequate supplies to complete our 
table of contents development program  a further tightening of steel supplies could restrain the program  limiting production growth and increasing development costs 
although drilling rigs have recently been in short supply throughout the industry  we have secured or contracted to secure the rigs necessary to support our current drilling program 
while an acquisition budget has not been formalized  we plan to actively review additional acquisition opportunities during if acquisition  development and exploration expenditures exceed cash flow from operations  we expect to obtain additional funding through our bank credit facilities  issuance of public or private debt or equity  or asset sales 
other than the requirement for us to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than  there are no restrictions under our revolving credit agreement that would affect our ability to use our remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
to date  we have not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and we do not expect to do so during however  new regulations  enforcement policies  claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share each quarter of  per common share for first and second quarter and per common share for the remainder of  and per common share for the first three quarters of in november  the board increased the dividend rate by declaring a fourth quarter dividend of per common share 
in january  the board declared a dividend of units of hugoton royalty trust for each share of our common stock outstanding on april  as a result of this dividend  all million trust units owned by us will be distributed to our stockholders on may  the dividend ratio is subject to change based on our outstanding share count on the record date 
in august  the board declared a dividend of units of cross timbers royalty trust for each share of our common stock outstanding on september  the market value at the date of distribution was approximately per common share 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon our financial condition  earnings and cash flow from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  our future business prospects and other matters our board deems relevant 
income taxes as of december   we had estimated tax loss carryforwards of million as a result of our acquisitions 
we expect to use these carryforwards in and we have not recorded any valuation allowance because we believe we have tax planning strategies available to realize our tax loss carryforwards 
we have estimated that all of our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards were fully utilized as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any investments in unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
under the terms of some of our operating leases for compressors  airplanes and vehicles  we have various residual value guarantees and other payment provisions upon our election to return the equipment under certain specified conditions 
guarantees related to these leases were not material 
the only material off balance sheet arrangements that we have entered into are those disclosed in the following table of contractual obligations and commitments 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our significant obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december  we have not guaranteed the debt or obligations of any other party  nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt or losses

transportation contracts 
we have entered firm transportation contracts with various pipelines 
under these contracts we are obligated to transport minimum daily gas volumes  as calculated on a monthly basis  or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate 
our production committed to these pipelines is expected to exceed the minimum daily volumes provided in the contracts 
we have generally delivered at least minimum volumes under these firm transportation contracts  therefore avoiding payment for deficiencies 
in july  we entered into a ten year firm transportation contract that commences upon completion of a new mile pipeline spanning from north texas to east texas 
upon the pipeline s completion  currently expected in  we will transport gas volumes for a minimum transportation fee ranging from million per month in the first year  up to approximately million per month beginning in the fourth year 
in october  we entered into a ten year firm transportation agreement that commences upon completion of a new mile pipeline spanning from east texas to northeast louisiana 
upon the pipeline s completion  currently expected as early as the winter of  we will transport daily gas volumes for a minimum monthly transportation fee of million plus fuel ranging from to depending on receipt point and other conditions 
the potential effect of these agreements are not included in the above summary of our transportation contract commitments since our commitment is contingent upon completion of the pipelines 
derivative contracts 
we have entered into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
as of december   the fixed prices specified by these contracts generally exceeded market prices  resulting in a net derivative fair value current asset of million and long term asset of million 
if market prices are higher than the contract prices when the cash settlement amount is calculated  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
as of december   the current liability related to such contracts was million 
while such payments generally will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received as much as days after payment to counterparties and can result in draws on our revolving credit facility

selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that the properties may be impaired 
such conditions include a significant decline in product prices which we believe to be other than temporary or a significant downward revision in estimated proved reserves for a field or area 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management s estimates of future product prices and costs  based on available information such as forward strip prices and industry forecasts and analysis 
an impairment provision must be recorded to adjust the net book value of the property to its estimated fair value if the net book value exceeds the estimated future net cash flows from the property 
the estimated fair value of the property is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows 

table of contents the impairment assessment process is primarily dependent upon the estimate of proved reserves 
any overstatement of estimated proved reserve quantities would result in an overstatement of estimated future net cash flows  which could result in an understated assessment of impairment 
the subjectivity and risks associated with estimating proved reserves are discussed under oil and gas reserves below 
prediction of product prices is subjective since prices are largely dependent upon supply and demand resulting from global and national conditions generally beyond our control 
however  management s assessment of product prices for purposes of impairment is consistent with that used in its business plans and investment decisions 
while there is judgment involved in management s estimate of future product prices  the potential impact on impairment is not currently significant since current and projected product prices are substantially higher than our net acquisition and development costs per mcfe 
because of this  our historical impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision in  and we do not currently expect significant future impairment unless product prices were to decline and remain at levels substantially below current levels 
we believe that a sensitivity analysis regarding the effect of changes in assumptions on estimated impairment is impracticable to provide because of the number of assumptions and variables involved which have interdependent effects on the potential outcome 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
proved reserves  as defined by the financial accounting standards board and adopted by the securities and exchange commission  are limited to reservoir areas that indicate economic producibility through actual production or conclusive formation tests  and generally cannot extend beyond the immediately adjoining undrilled portion 
although improved technology often can identify possible or probable reserves other than by drilling  these reserves cannot be estimated and disclosed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  net upward revisions occurred to proved reserves on an mcfe basis in and  resulting in a decrease of dd a expense of approximately  or million  in and  or million  in net downward revisions of proved reserves on an mcfe basis occurred in  resulting in an increase in dd a expense of approximately  or million 
based on proved reserves at december   we estimate that a change in proved reserves would increase or decrease dd a expense by approximately million 
during  development and exploration activities resulted in extensions  additions  discoveries and net revisions of proved reserves that were of our production 
over the last five years  our proved reserve extensions  additions  discoveries and net revisions averaged of our production for this period 
our proved reserve extensions  additions and discoveries in included an increase of bcfe in proved undeveloped reserves  or approximately of our total extensions  additions and discoveries  which are expected to be developed within three years 
over the past five years  approximately of our proved reserves extensions  additions and discoveries were proved undeveloped reserves which were generally reclassified to proved developed reserves within three years 
development of our proved undeveloped reserves is not subject to significant uncertainties such as regulatory approvals  and we believe that we have adequate resources to develop these reserves  dependent on commodity prices not declining significantly 
we believe that reserve additions  comparable to these historical reserve additions  are attainable in the near term future  subject to product prices and development costs remaining at levels to ensure economic viability 

table of contents the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in note to consolidated financial statements  are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
asset retirement obligation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties including removal of our offshore platforms in alaska at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we increased our estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately of the asset retirement obligation at december   based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
commodity prices and risk management commodity prices significantly affect our operating results  financial condition  cash flows and ability to borrow funds 
current market oil and gas prices are affected by supply and demand as well as seasonal  political and other conditions which we generally cannot control 
oil and gas prices and markets are expected to continue their historical volatility 
see significant events  transactions and conditions product prices above 
we attempt to reduce our price risk on a portion of our production by entering into financial instruments such as futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
while these instruments secure a certain price and  therefore  a certain cash flow  there is the risk that we may not be able to realize the full benefit of rising prices 
these contracts also expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the contract counterparties  all of which are major investment grade financial institutions 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by obtaining letters of credit or other appropriate forms of security 
while our price risk management activities decrease the volatility of cash flows  they may obscure our reported financial condition 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we record derivative financial instruments at their fair value  representing projected gains and losses to be realized upon settlement of these contracts in subsequent periods when related production occurs 
these gains and losses are generally offset by increases and decreases in the market value of our proved reserves  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
derivatives that provide effective cash flow hedges are designated as hedges  and  to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective  we defer related unrealized fair value gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged transaction occurs

table of contents accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that compensation related to all stock based awards  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we are adopting sfas no 
r as of january  and  for stock awards on and after the date  we will be using either a lattice model or a monte carlo simulation model to value these stock awards 
we have previously recorded stock compensation pursuant to the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 whereby no compensation was recognized for most stock option awards 
we expect that stock option grants will continue to be a significant part of employee compensation  and  therefore  sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we do not expect sfas no 
r to significantly change recorded compensation expense related to grants of performance and unrestricted shares 
for the pro forma effect of recording compensation for all stock awards at fair value  utilizing the black scholes method  see note to consolidated financial statements 
we are using the modified prospective application method of adopting sfas no 
r  whereby the estimated fair value of unvested stock awards granted prior to january  will be recognized as compensation expense in periods subsequent to december   based on the same valuation method used in our pro forma disclosure 
as of december   we had million stock options outstanding that had not yet vested  with a remaining estimated fair value of million 
based on this estimated fair value  we currently anticipate stock option compensation expense for service periods after december  will be million in both and  and million in related in these stock options 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
fsp r addresses the classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
since we do not currently issue stock awards that allow for cash settlement  the adoption of fsp r is not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position 
in march  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
sab no 
provides implementation guidance for sfas no 
r and specifies the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
under the provisions of fin no 
 the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity while the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation is required to be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
we have adopted fin no 
as of december  adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements  and we do not expect this pronouncement to have a significant effect on our future reported financial position or earnings 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 a voluntary change in accounting principle requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the guidance contained in opinion no 
for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate was not changed 
we are implementing this new standard as of january  this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or earnings 

table of contents production imbalances we have gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
we use the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred for gas deliveries in excess of our net revenue interest  while revenue is accrued for the undelivered volumes 
production imbalances are generally recorded at the estimated sales price in effect at the time of production 
as of december   we had a net gas imbalance payable of million of which million is included as a net current receivable and million is included as a net long term payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had a net gas imbalance payable of million of which million is included as a net current receivable and million is included as a net long term payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to our operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may be or may concern  among other things  capital expenditures  capital budget  cash flow  drilling activity  drilling locations  acquisition and development activities and funding thereof  production and reserve growth  pricing differentials  reserve potential  operating costs  operating margins  production activities  oil  gas and natural gas liquids reserves and prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  liquidity  debt repayment  unused borrowing capacity  estimated stock award vesting periods  completion of pipelines and processing facilities  regulatory matters  competition and value of non cash dividends 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  predicts  anticipates  believes  estimates  goal  should  could  assume  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in item a  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only enter derivative financial instruments in conjunction with our hedging activities 
these instruments principally include commodity futures  collars  swaps and option agreements and interest rate swap agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of fluctuations in interest rates and natural gas and crude oil prices 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
our board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by us relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
risk management programs using derivatives must be authorized by the chairman of the board and the senior executive vice president and chief of staff 
these programs are also reviewed quarterly by our internal risk management committee and annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of billion  which approximated its fair value  and our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of billion and an approximate fair value of billion 
we attempt to balance variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest cost  interest rate volatility and financing risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate senior and subordinated debt  as well as the occasional use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
in millions carrying amount fair value a hypothetical change in fair value december  long term debt december  long term debt a fair value is based upon current market quotes and is the estimated amount required to purchase our long term debt on the open market 
this estimated value does not include any redemption premium 
commodity price risk we hedge a portion of our price risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   we had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
these contracts and agreements had a net fair value gain of approximately million at december  and a net fair value loss of million at december  of the december  fair value  a million gain has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts  and a million gain has been determined based on the broker bid and ask quotes for basis contracts 
these fair values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparties 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements at december  outstanding oil futures contracts and differential swaps had a net fair value loss of million as of december  and a net fair value loss of million at december  the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in oil prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these oil futures and differential swaps at december  none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
because most of our futures contracts and swap agreements have been designated as hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value generally are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to product revenues in the consolidated income statement 
we had a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract was priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it was accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument 
this contract referred to as the enron btu swap contract was terminated in december in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation 
in november  we entered derivative contracts to effectively defer until and any cash flow impact related to  mcf of daily gas deliveries in that were to be made under the enron btu swap contract 
the net fair value loss on these contracts was million at december  and million at december  as of february   we terminated the remaining portion of these contracts  resulting in total expected payments to the counterparty of approximately million in first quarter since the contracts are not hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value are recognized in our consolidated income statement as a derivative fair value gain or loss
