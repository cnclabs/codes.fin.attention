item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
please see forward looking statements on page therefore  the information set forth therein should be carefully considered when evaluating business prospects of the company 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
sale of sba loans in calculating gain on the sale of sba loans  the bank performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portions of the loan 
the company assumptions are validated by reference to external market information 
available for sale securities the fair value of most securities classified as available for sale is based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are explained in the section below titled income tax and in note to the consolidated financial statements presented in our k 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset will not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
secondary stock offering the bank filed a registration statement on form sb on march  with respect to a proposed public offering of the bank s common stock for an aggregate consideration of  the registration statement was declared effective by the comptroller on april  a second registration statement  registering additional shares to cover over subscriptions was filed with the comptroller on june   and became effective as of that date 
the bank completed the offering of  shares of common stock  par value  at a price of per share  for an aggregate consideration of  on june  operating results for the year ended december   the company reported net income of  or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared with net income of  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  and  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the improvement in net income for resulted primarily from an increase of million in net interest income  offset  in part  by an increase of million in provision for credit losses and million in other expense 
see the specific sections below for details regarding these changes 
net income for represented a decrease of  compared to primarily due to a one time benefit of million related to the recognition of deferred tax assets in the impact was offset  in part  by an increase of million in net interest income and an increase of million in other income  offset  in part  by an increase of million in provision for credit losses and million in other expense 
net interest income and margin net interest income is the principal source of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the nature and volume of earning assets held during the year  the rates earned on such assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

volume changes are caused by changes in the levels of average earning assets and average interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
rate changes result from changes in yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
changes not solely attributable to volume or rates have been allocated to the rate component

net interest income in compared to  comprised of  in interest income and  in interest expense  for the year ended december  the increase of  in net interest income in was primarily due to an increase of  in interest income offset  in part  by an increase of  in interest expense 
net interest income for the year ended december  represented an increase of  over  for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase of  in interest income offset  in part  by an increase of  in interest expense 
the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  and for the improvement in net interest margin in compared to was primarily the result of increases in the prime rate during the year and a shift in the mix of loans toward higher yielding product lines 
the improvement in net interest margin in compared to was primarily the result of increases in the prime rate during the second half of the year  a shift in the mix of loans toward higher yielding product lines  and a shift in the mix of deposits toward lower cost sources of funds 
average loans represented of average earning assets in compared to in and in in addition  in the bank s ratio of average loans to average deposits was  up from in and in significant factors affecting net interest income are rates  volumes and mix of the loan  investment and deposit portfolios 
due to the nature of the bank s lending markets  in which the majority of loans are generally tied to prime rate  we believe that an increase in interest rates should positively affect the bank s future earnings  while a decline will have a negative impact 
however  it is not feasible to provide an accurate measure of such a change because of the many factors many of them uncontrollable influencing the result 
interest income for the year ended december   the company reported interest income of  an increase of  or over  reported in the increase in interest income primarily reflects an increase in the volume of average earning assets in compared to average earning assets were million for the year ended december  an increase of million or over million for the year ended december  in addition  the majority of the bank s earning assets have rate structures that re price with movements in short term interest rates  primarily the prime rate and fed funds rate

credit risk and provision for credit losses the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses which is based  in part  on loss experience of the bank and the california banking industry  the impact of economic conditions within the bank s market area  and  as applicable  the state of california  the value of underlying collateral  loan performance and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by charge offs and increased by provisions for credit losses charged to operating expense and recoveries of previously charged off loans 
based on management s current evaluation of such risks  additions of   and  were made to the allowance for credit losses in  and  respectively 
during  the bank had charge offs totaling  and recoveries of  as compared to  in charge offs and  in recoveries in and  charged off and  in recoveries in the resulting allowance for credit losses was  representing of total loans at december  as compared to  representing of total loans at december  and  representing of total loans at december  the accrual of interest on loans would be discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectibility of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
there was one non accrual loan at december  totaling  as compared to two non accrual loans at december  totaling  and one loan totaling  at december  at december   non accrual loans consisted of one commercial loan totaling  which is secured by business assets and real property with values in excess of the loan s carrying value 
in addition  at december   and  there were no loans past due days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing interest 
at december   and there were no properties owned by the bank acquired through the foreclosure process 
management is of the opinion that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  the bank s loan portfolio  which includes approximately  in real estate loans  representing approximately of the portfolio  could be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the bank s market area were to weaken 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of non performing loans and oreo and the level of the allowance for loan losses  which could adversely affect the bank s future growth and profitability

the increases in non interest income in compared to are primarily due to increased sba loan servicing income and an increase in the value of bank owned life insurance  offset by a decrease in gains recognized on sale of sba loans 
in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher volumes of sba loan sales as a result of expansion of the sba lending operation

the bank had fte at december  as compared to fte at december  and fte at december  occupancy expense for the year ended december  was  and represented an increase of  over  for the prior year 
the increase in occupancy expense in is primarily due to expense related to the facility at almaden blvd  san jose  california and the new facility at crow canyon place  suite san ramon  california 
in  occupancy expense increased  to  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to the consolidation of offices of the company in a new  larger headquarters facility in downtown san jose and the addition of two loan production offices in the sba group 
the company contracts with third party vendors for most data processing needs and to support technical infrastructure 
data processing expense in was  which represented an increase of  over  one year earlier 
in  data processing costs increased  to  compared to  in the increases in data processing in both years are primarily due to increases in deposit transaction volumes in addition to increases in fte

in october of  the bank established a loan production office in san diego county 
the bank  as a preferred lender  originates sba loans and participates in the sba a and sba lending programs 
under the a program  a loan is made for commercial or real estate purposes 
the sba guarantees these loans and the guarantee may range from to of the total loan 
in addition  the loan could be collateralized by a deed of trust on real estate 
under the program  the bank lends directly to the borrower and takes a first deed of trust to the subject property 
in addition the sba  through a community development corporation makes an additional loan to the borrower and takes a deed of trust subject to the bank s position 
the bank s position in relation to the real estate piggyback loans can range from to loan to value 
at december   sba loans comprised million or of total loans as compared to million or of total loans at december  and million or of total loans at december  the bank has the intent to sell all or a portion of the sba loans and  as such  carries the saleable portion of sba loans at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value 
at december   and  the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
the bank s construction loan portfolio primarily consists of loans to finance individual single family residential homes  approximately half of which are owner occupied projects

at december   other real estate loans represented of total loans as compared to at december  and at december  factoring and asset based lending represents purchased accounts receivable factoring and a structured accounts receivable lending program where the bank receives client specific payment for client invoices 
under the factoring program  the bank purchases accounts receivable invoices from its clients and then receives payment directly from the party obligated for the receivable 
in most cases the bank purchases the receivables subject to recourse from the bank s factoring client 
the asset based lending program requires a security interest in all of a client s accounts receivable 
at december   factoring asset based loans totaled million or of total loans as compared to million or of total loans at december  other loans consist primarily of loans to individuals for personal uses  such as installment purchases  overdraft protection loans and a variety of other consumer purposes 
at december   other loans totaled million as compared to million at december  and million at december allowance for loan losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of the borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of estimating specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the level of the related provision for loan losses is determined in management s judgment based on consideration of economic conditions  borrowers financial condition loan impairment evaluation of industry trends historic losses  migrations and delinquency trends industry and other concentrations loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio periodic review and evaluation of problem loans off balance sheet risks assessments by regulators and other third parties in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio  the bank also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a regular basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the federal banking regulators also conduct examinations of the loan portfolio periodically

funding deposits represent the bank s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area

the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the board of governors and the occ 
the company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least of assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings tier capital and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock or a limited amount of allowance for credit losses 
certain assets and commitments to extend credit present less risk than others and will be assigned to lower risk weighted categories requiring less capital allocation than the total ratio 
for example  cash and government securities are assigned to a risk weighted category  most home mortgage loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring a capital allocation and commercial loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring an capital allocation 
as of december   the company s and the bank s total risk based capital ratios were approximately and  respectively  for the company and for the bank at december  
the board of governors and other federal banking agencies have adopted a revised minimum leverage ratio for companying organizations as a supplement to the risk weighted capital guidelines 
the old rule established a minimum leverage standard for well run banking organizations bank holding companies and banks with diversified risk profiles 
banking organizations that did not exhibit such characteristics or had greater risk due to significant growth  among other factors  were required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio to higher 
the old rule did not take into account the implementation of the market risk capital measure set forth in the federal regulatory agency capital adequacy guidelines 
the revised leverage ratio establishes a minimum tier ratio of tier capital to total assets for the highest rated bank holding companies and banks 
all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of with higher leverage capital ratios required for banking organizations that have significant financial and or operational weaknesses  a high risk profile  or are undergoing or anticipating rapid growth

the fdicia  among other matters  substantially revised banking regulations and established a framework for determination of capital adequacy of financial institutions 
under the fdicia  financial institutions are placed into one of five capital adequacy categories as follows well capitalized consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater  and the institution is not subject to an order  written agreement  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive  adequately capitalized consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater  and the institution does not meet the definition of a well capitalized institution  undercapitalized consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  significantly undercapitalized consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  critically undercapitalized consisting of an institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
financial institutions classified as undercapitalized or below are subject to various limitations including  among other matters  certain supervisory actions by bank regulatory authorities and restrictions related to i growth of assets  ii payment of interest on subordinated indebtedness  iii payment of dividends or other capital distributions  and iv payment of management fees to a parent holding company 
the fdicia requires the bank regulatory authorities to initiate corrective action regarding financial institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
such action may result in orders to  among other matters  augment capital and reduce total assets 
critically undercapitalized financial institutions may also be subject to appointment of a receiver or implementation of a capitalization plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity interest rate sensitivity the bank strives to manage its liquidity to provide adequate funds at an acceptable cost to support borrowing requirements and deposit flows of its customers 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
the bank s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
the bank strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
at december   liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were as compared to in in addition to cash and due from banks  liquid assets include interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and unpledged securities available for sale 
management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity continue to be appropriate 
the bank also utilizes a monthly gap report as well as a quarterly simulation model to identify rate sensitivity over the short and long term 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities  based on contractual terms  of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie interest rate gap divided by interest rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
based on the contractual terms of its assets and liabilities  the bank s balance sheet at december  was asset sensitive in terms of its short term exposure to interest rates 
that is  at december  the volume of assets that might reprice within the next year exceeded the volume of liabilities that might reprice 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of rate decreases
