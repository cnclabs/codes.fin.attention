on an on going basis  the company evaluates it s estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  percentage of completion o f long term contracts  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases it s estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that ar e believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form th e basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilitie s that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual result s have not been materially different from the company s estimates
