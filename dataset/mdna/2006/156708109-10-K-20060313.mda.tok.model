acquisitions  transactions and regulatory actions during  we consummated a number of transactions that strengthened our therapeutic focus on cancer in the us and europe and gave us access to a new area alcohol dependence 
as a part of our business strategy  we expect to continue to consider and  as appropriate  consummate acquisitions of other technologies  products and businesses and enter into collaborative arrangements 
we also made significant strides in toward final approval of our product candidates

for the same labeled indications as provigil  and receiving approvable letters from the fda for vivitrol  for the treatment of alcohol dependence in combination with a treatment program that includes psychosocial support  and for sparlon  for the treatment of adhd in children and adolescents between the ages of six through settlements of patent infringement lawsuits as a biopharmaceutical company  our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our products and technology 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement of  our patents 
the loss of patent protection on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or patent expiration  would materially impact our results of operations 
in late and early  we announced the settlement of four separate patent infringement lawsuits related to modafinil that we had filed against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc 
as part of these separate settlements  we agreed to grant to each of teva  mylan  ranbaxy and barr a non exclusive royalty bearing right to market and sell a generic version of provigil in the united states 
these licenses will become effective in october  unless we obtain a pediatric extension for provigil  which would permit entry in april an earlier entry may occur based upon the entry of another generic version of provigil 
in connection with the barr  ranbaxy and teva settlements  we also entered into a series of business arrangements related to modafinil with barr  ranbaxy and teva 
we received licenses to certain modafinil related intellectual property developed by each party and in exchange for these licenses  we agreed to make payments to these three companies collectively totaling up to million over the next several years  consisting of upfront payments  milestones and royalties on net sales of our modafinil products 
in order to maintain an adequate supply of the active drug substance modafinil  we entered into agreements with three modafinil suppliers whereby we will purchase an annual minimum amount of modafinil over a six year period beginning in  with the aggregate payments over that period totaling approximately million 
in february  we also announced that we had settled our pending united states patent infringement dispute with barr related to its abbreviated new drug application anda filed with the fda seeking to sell a generic version of actiq 
under the settlement  we will grant barr an exclusive royalty bearing right to market and sell a generic version of actiq in the united states  effective on december  barr will pay specified royalties on net profits of a generic actiq product for the period december  through february   subject to certain limitations 
the patents covering the current formulation of the product are set to expire as early as september  if we are successful in our efforts to complete a clinical study of actiq in pediatric patients prior to september  the fda could grant us six months of exclusivity beyond the september  patent expiration 
under the license and supply agreement we entered into with barr in july  we could face generic competition from barr prior to december  if we receive fda approval of febt before this date or if we are unable to complete the ongoing pediatric studies with actiq prior to september each of these settlements has been filed with both the ftc and the antitrust division of the doj as required by the medicare modernization act 
the ftc has requested from us  and we have provided  certain information in connection with its review of the settlements 
the ftc  the doj  or a private party could challenge in an administrative or judicial proceeding any or all of the settlements if they believe that the agreements violate the antitrust laws 
if the settlements are challenged  there is no assurance that we could successfully defend against such challenge and  in that case  we could be subject to  among other things  damages  fines and possible invalidation of the settlement agreements 
indebtedness we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  nearly all of which consists of convertible notes with restricted conversion prices lower than our stock price as of the filing date of this report 
under the terms of the indentures governing the notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
for a more complete description of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash  and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
as of december  and as of the filing date of this report  the fair value of both the notes and the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes and  as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
while we seek to increase profitability and cash flow from operations  we will need to continue to achieve growth of product sales and other revenues sufficient for us to attain these objectives 
the rate of our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection for our currently marketed products  or to successfully develop or acquire and commercialize new product candidates

co promotion agreement with mcneil in august  we entered into an agreement with mcneil consumer specialty pharmaceuticals division of mcneil ppc  inc concerning the co promotion of sparlon 
under the co promotion agreement  mcneil has agreed to have at least mcneil sales representatives co promote and detail sparlon upon fda approval in the united states primarily to pediatricians  psychiatrists and pediatric neurologists 
we will promote the product to psychiatrists  neurologists  primary care physicians  and other appropriate health care professionals and will retain all responsibility for the development  manufacture  distribution and sale of the product 
we will pay mcneil commission fees calculated as a percentage of annual net sales of sparlon during the term of the agreement and  if specified sales levels are reached in the final year of the agreement  during the three calendar years following the expiration of the agreement 
commission fees will be recognized as sales and marketing expenses in the same period that the related net sales are recognized

results of operations dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  increase decrease united states europe total united states europe total united states europe total sales provigil      actiq       gabitril       other       total sales      other revenues total revenues     sales in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which accounted for of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated ims health 
we believe that speculative buying of product  particularly in anticipation of possible price increases  has been the historic practice of many pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in past years  we attempted to minimize these fluctuations both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory which we had historically defined as approximately one month s supply at our current sales level and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
over the past two years  our wholesaler customers  as well as others in the industry  began modifying their business models from arrangements where they derive profits from the management of various discounts and rebates  to arrangements where they charge a fee for their services 
in connection with this new wholesaler business model  we finalized wholesaler service agreements in the third quarter of with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from our three largest us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately to weeks supply at our current sales levels 
for the year ended december   total sales increased by over the prior period 
the factors that contributed to the increase in sales are summarized as follows sales of provigil increased as compared to the same period last year 
demand for provigil increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for provigil of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of provigil also were impacted by domestic price increases of approximately from period to period  offset by a decrease in the number of units of inventory held by us wholesalers and an increase in product sales allowances 
sales of actiq increased as compared to the same period last year 
demand for actiq increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for actiq of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of actiq also were impacted by an increase in domestic prices of approximately from period to period  offset by a decrease in the number of units of inventory held by us wholesalers as well as an increase in product sales allowances 
sales of gabitril decreased as compared to the same period last year 
us prescriptions for gabitril decreased according to ims health 
this decrease was driven primarily by our decision to reduce our sales and marketing efforts following an update in february to the label information for gabitril 
for the year ended december   sales of gabitril also were impacted by domestic price increases of approximately from period to period  offset by a decrease in the number of units held by us wholesalers as well as an increase in product sales allowances 
other sales  which consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products  increased as compared to the same period last year 
the most significant increases in this category are sales of products manufactured and sold to pharmaceutical partners by cima labs  which we acquired in august  sales of naxy clarithromycin  which we acquired in december and sales of trisenox which we acquired in july analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales to arrive at a net sales figure for the year ended december  change change gross sales    product sales allowances prompt payment discounts    wholesaler discounts   returns    coupons    medicaid discounts    managed care and governmental contracts    net sales product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales increases in the product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales from to primarily reflect the establishment of a wholesaler discount reserve in to provide for fees consistent with the terms of the wholesaler service agreements  increased medicaid discounts resulting from both increased usage and increased rebate percentages due to price increases  and additional rebates for certain governmental programs 
in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to continue to trend upward due to the impact of potential future price increases on medicaid discounts and potential increases related to medicaid  managed care and governmental contracts sales 
other revenues the increase of from period to period is primarily due to the inclusion of product development and licensing fees and royalties attributable to cima labs of million for the year ended december   compared to million from the acquisition date of august  to december  for the year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales    research and development    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    impairment charges    acquired in process research and development   cost of sales the cost of sales was approximately of net sales in and of net sales in the increase is primarily due the inclusion of twelve months of cima labs product sales for which the margin is lower than our other products instead of only approximately months in this increase was also impacted by the net effect of price increases on our three major us products effective february and july and increases in our product sales allowances 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  in as compared to of this increase  million is due to an increase in headcount and headcount related expenditures necessary to support higher levels of clinical activities and expenditures 
the remainder of the increase is largely due to increased research and development expenditures related to the exploration of the utility of gabitril in gad and phase studies of febt  increased research and development expenditures related to facilities and operations and the inclusion of a full year of cima labs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in clinical research costs due to the conclusion in of four double blind studies in our nuvigil program 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to  primarily due expenditures associated with an increase in headcount  the inclusion of a full year of cima labs  which was acquired in august and increased sales and marketing costs in france to support naxy and mono naxy  which we acquired from sanofi synthelabo france in december these increases were partially offset by a reduction in gabitril marketing activity 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  in as compared to this increase is primarily the result of increased capital investments in software  buildings  and leasehold and laboratory improvements at our west chester and frazer locations  increased spending on manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location and the acquisition of property  plant and equipment associated with the cima labs acquisition 
amortization expense increased due to the amortization of technology  trademark and marketing rights acquired from cima labs in the third quarter of  the amortization of french marketing rights to naxy and mono naxy and the amortization of trisenox technology acquired in july impairment charges in  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of an intangible asset resulting from the termination of a distribution agreement in the united kingdom in march in  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of an investment in mds proteomics  inc acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development increased million  or  in as compared to the increase in acquired in process research and development expense in as compared to is primarily due to our acquisitions of zeneus and salmedix and the license and collaboration agreement we entered into with alkermes for vivitrol

this increase was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to higher average debt balances 
a million decrease in debt exchange expense which was recognized in related to the exchange of million of our convertible subordinated notes 
a million increase in write off of deferred debt issuance costs were recognized in related to the convertible senior subordinated notes 
a net gain charge on early extinguishment of debt of million in compared to million in the net gain in includes a million gain on the repurchase of approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes and a net loss of million on the termination of the interest rate swap agreement associated with million notional amount of the convertible subordinated notes

this compared to tax expense of million on a loss before income taxes of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the change in effective tax rates between and is primarily due to million non deductible acquired in process research and development charges related to the salmedix and zeneus acquisitions for which no tax benefit was recorded 
for tax reporting purposes  these acquisitions were treated as stock purchases

based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers was approximately one month s supply 
for the year ended december   total sales increased by over the prior period 
the factors that contributed to the increase in sales are summarized as follows at the beginning of  we consolidated our two former us sales forces into a single unit that detailed all three products to a broader group of physicians  including primary care physicians eg internists  general practitioners and family practitioners 
in addition  we expanded this combined force to approximately persons 
we believe this substantially larger sales force  coupled with focused marketing efforts designed to educate physicians and communicate the benefits of our products  contributed to the increases in total sales for the year ended december  an expanded us label for provigil received from the fda in early was a key factor in contributing to the year over year increase in provigil sales 
us prescriptions for provigil increased by  according to ims health 
the period to period change was also impacted by lower sales recorded in the first quarter of as a result of the depletion of inventory levels at certain wholesalers 
additionally  domestic price increases of approximately period over period contributed to higher sales 
sales of actiq increased as compared to last year 
us prescriptions for actiq increased by  according to ims health 
in addition  domestic prices increased approximately from period to period 
sales of gabitril increased as compared to last year 
us prescriptions for gabitril increased by  according to ims health 
an increase in domestic prices of approximately period over period also contributed to higher sales recorded in other sales consist of sales of other products and certain third party products in various international markets  principally in france and sales of products manufactured by cima labs and sold to its pharmaceutical partners 
the most significant products in this other sales category are spasfon phloroglucinol with total sales of million and fonzylane buflomedil with total sales of million  both of which are sold by cephalon france

the change in the product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales is primarily driven by higher medicaid discounts  and managed care and governmental contract discounts and chargebacks resulting from the impact of price increases and increased participation 
other revenues the increase in other revenues of from period to period is primarily due to the inclusion of product development and licensing fees and royalties of million attributable to cima labs partially offset by a decrease in partner reimbursements on both our cep program and our cep program and a reduction in earnings recognized under our collaboration agreement with novartis pharma ag 
the level of other revenue recognized from period to period may continue to fluctuate based on the status and activity of each related project and terms of each collaboration agreement 
therefore  past levels of other revenues may not be indicative of future levels

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  in as compared to of this increase  million is due to clinical research costs including expenditures associated with increased headcount necessary to support higher levels of clinical activities and expenditures associated with additional clinical studies initiated in to explore the utility of gabitril beyond its current indication  costs incurred with phase clinical programs for sparlon which began in late  and costs incurred with our phase studies of nuvigil which began in the fourth quarter of the increase in also was impacted by higher costs incurred during associated with supplying materials for our clinical trials in process  developing new or improved production processes for our currently marketed products and products in development  and by the inclusion of cima labs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase is predominantly the result of the expansion of our european and us field sales forces  additional product promotional expenses and an increased number of educational programs 
in addition  a portion of the increase is due to higher administrative expenses associated with an increase in headcount  costs associated with complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  and higher accruals for bonus expenses resulting from a shift away from a stock option based incentive compensation plan to a cash based incentive compensation plan 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition of a gain of million in as a result of retiree medical benefit changes for current employees at cephalon france 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to depreciation expense increased period over period primarily as a result of increased capital investments in software  building and laboratory improvements at our west chester location  increased spending on manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location and the acquisition of property  plant and equipment associated with the cima labs acquisition 
amortization expense increased due to the amortization of technology  trademark and marketing rights acquired from cima labs 
impairment charge during  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of our investment in mds proteomics inc acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of cima labs  we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
at the acquisition date  cima labs ongoing research and development initiatives were focused on the development and commencement of phase clinical trials of febt  and several other minor ongoing research and development projects 
these costs were charged to expense in the third quarter of since  at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses

interest expense decreased by million due primarily to a decrease in interest and amortization expense resulting from the repurchases and redemptions of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes during and partially offset by an increase in amortization expense associated with debt issuance costs from the june sales of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes 
in july  a holder of our convertible subordinated notes approached us  and we agreed  to exchange million of these outstanding notes into  shares of our common stock 
we recognized debt exchange expense of million in the third quarter of relating to this exchange in accordance with sfas no

as a result  during  million was recognized in our financial statements as a charge on early extinguishment of debt

working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to the reclassification of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes from long term liabilities to current liabilities as these notes were convertible at december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the increase was driven by the growth in income from sales  partially offset by the non recurring payment of million in june to alkermes under the vivitrol license and collaboration agreement 
the payment to alkermes has been recorded as an ipr d charge as the product has not yet received fda approval 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the decrease in is primarily a result of increases in current assets  particularly trade receivables  partially offset by increases in current liabilities 
our loss of million in includes non cash expenditures of million of acquired in process research and development expense  million of impairment expense and million of debt exchange expense 
net cash used for investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for during  our primary uses of cash for investing activities were related to our acquisition of salmedix in june for million  net of cash acquired  our acquisition of trisenox in july for million  and our of acquisition of zeneus in december for million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we are currently investing funds to make facilities improvements at our new corporate headquarters in frazer  pennsylvania and at our west chester  salt lake city and france locations to accommodate our growth  and we are purchasing manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location for the production of actiq and other products  including febt  if approved  for the us and european markets 
net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the change is primarily due to our acquisition of cima labs in august for million  net of cash acquired or million  net of cash  cash equivalents and investments acquired and the increase of purchases of available for sale investments in order to benefit from rising interest rates on longer term investments 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the french marketing rights to naxy and mono naxy from sanofi synthelabo france for million 
net cash used for investing activities in included the purchase of non marketable securities totaling million  which included million for the purchase of securities of mds proteomics inc mdsp  a privately held canadian company 
the carrying value of the investment in mdsp was written off as an impairment charge in the second quarter of net cash provided by used for financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used for financing activities of million in we received net proceeds in of million from the sale of convertible senior subordinated notes 
concurrent with the sale of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge for million and sold warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a tender offer to purchase our outstanding convertible subordinated notes for million in cash 
during  we repurchased million of the convertible subordinated notes 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the change is primarily the result of net proceeds of million received in from the sale of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes 
concurrent with the private placement of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge for million and sold warrants for million 
during  we repurchased million of the convertible subordinated notes and million of the convertible subordinated notes 
the volume of exercises of common stock options decreased in as compared to the volume of exercises of common stock options increased in as compared to the extent and timing of option exercises are primarily dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general financial market conditions  as well as the exercise prices and expiration dates of the options 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings for a complete description of legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter debt obligations      convertible notes     purchase obligations      capital lease obligations    interest payments on debt     operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    as of the filing date of this report  our notes and zero coupoon notes are considered to be current liabilities and will be presented in current portion of long term debt in our march  consolidated balance sheet unless our stock price decreases to a level where these notes are no longer convertible 
for a discussion of our obligations under the convertible notes  see outlook indebtedness below 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs primarily in the area of research and development agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the potential milestone and other contingency payments due under current contractual agreements are approximately million 
outlook we expect to use our remaining cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes and regulatory or sales milestones that may become due to cti  alkermes  or the former stockholders of salmedix  among others  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
however  in  we expect that sales of our currently marketed products  together with sales of our near term product candidates  assuming approval in the anticipated time frames  should allow us to generate positive cash flow from operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of our products  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates 
based on our current level of operations  projected sales of our existing products and estimated sales from our product candidates  if approved  combined with other revenues and interest income  we also believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness  particularly if such indebtedness is presented for conversion by holders see indebtedness below  or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
marketed products continued sales growth of provigil beyond the june expiration of orphan drug exclusivity depends  in part  on the continued effectiveness of the various settlement agreements we entered into in late and early  as well as our maintaining protection in the united states and abroad of the modafinil particle size patent through its expiration beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
future growth of modafinil based product sales in and beyond also will depend in part on our ability to achieve final fda approval of nuvigil and sparlon  which we anticipate in the second quarter of our sales of actiq depend on our existing patent protection for the approved compressed powder formulation  which expires in the us in september the patent covering the previous formulation of actiq expired in may see certain risks related to our business below 
if we are successful in our efforts to complete clinical studies in pediatric patients prior to september  the fda could grant us six months of exclusivity beyond the september compressed powder patent expiration 
however  even with this additional exclusivity  barr s license to the actiq patents could become effective as early as december  or the date of launch of febt expected in late 
the entry of barr with a generic form of actiq later this year likely will significantly and negatively impact future actiq sales 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
for  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we expect to continue the following significant clinical programs  among others  in a phase program evaluating gabitril for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  a phase program evaluating treanda for the treatment of nhl  and a phase program evaluating cep for the treatment of aml 
we may seek to mitigate the risk in our research and development programs by seeking sources of funding for a portion of these expenses through collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts in  we expect to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
the aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in will likely be significantly higher than that incurred in  primarily as a result of higher expenses associated with an increase in the size of our sales force and planned product launches for sparlon  nuvigil  and febt  if approved 
in  we expect to continue in process capital expenditure projects at our research and development facilities in france and west chester and at our salt lake city manufacturing facility 
indebtedness we have significant indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of indebtedness on convertible subordinated notes 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our most significant convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of december  security outstanding in millions conversion price redemption rights and obligations convertible senior subordinated notes due june the notes generally not redeemable by the holder prior to december zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
stated conversion prices as per the terms of the notes 
however  each convertible note contains certain terms restricting a holder s ability to convert the notes  including that a holder may only convert if the closing price of our stock on the day prior to conversion is higher than  or with respect to the notes  the zero coupon notes or the zero coupon notes  respectively 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  the restrictions on conversion have been satisfied and the aggregate outstanding principal balance of such affected notes are considered to be current liabilities and will be presented in current portion of long term debt in our march  consolidated balance sheet unless our stock price decreases to a level where these notes are no longer convertible 
for a more complete description of these notes  including the associated convertible note hedge  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have approximately  million of convertible notes outstanding  all of which is are considered to be current liabilities and will be presented in current portion of long term debt in our march  consolidated balance sheet unless our stock price decreases to a level where these notes are no longer convertible 
our and zero coupon notes are presently convertible and  under the terms of the indentures governing the notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to repay any principal balance of notes presented for conversion  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
the current portion of our long term indebtedness increased by million compared to during the fourth quarter of  our notes became convertible and  in january  our and zero coupon notes also became convertible 
as a result  the notes have been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet as of december  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for summary of our convertible debt  note hedge and call warrant and  as of the filing date of this report  our zero coupon notes are now also considered to be current liabilities 
as of december  and as of the filing date of this report  the fair value of both the notes and the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes and  as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
the annual interest payments on our convertible notes outstanding as of december  are million  payable at various dates throughout the year 
in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or debt  or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
our notes and and zero coupon notes each are considered instrument c securities as defined by eitf  convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion  therefore  these notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the period  and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period 
at the time we sold our notes and zero coupon notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by increasing the effective conversion price for these notes  from our perspective  to and  respectively 
however  from a us gaap perspective  sfas no 
considers only the impact of the convertible notes and the warrant agreements  since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is always anti dilutive  sfas no 
requires that we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 
under the treasury stock method  changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price will require the inclusion of additional shares in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares 
the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes  the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion share price convertible notes shares warrant shares total treasury stock method incremental shares shares due to cephalon under note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under us gaap represents the number of incremental shares to be issued by us upon conversion of the convertible notes  assuming concurrent settlement of the convertible note hedges and warrants 
acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue stock or raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product approvals  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for of our worldwide net sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us may have materially affected the level of our sales in any particular period and thus our sales may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health 
we believe that speculative buying of product  particularly in anticipation of possible price increases  has been the historic practice of many pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in past years  we attempted to minimize these fluctuations both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory which we had historically defined as approximately one month s supply at our current sales level and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
over the past two years  our wholesaler customers  as well as others in the industry  began modifying their business models from arrangements where they derive profits from the management of various discounts and rebates  to arrangements where they charge a fee for their services 
in connection with this new wholesaler business model  we finalized wholesaler service agreements in the third quarter of with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from our three largest us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately to weeks supply at our current sales levels 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob shipping point 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is picked up by a common carrier for shipment to the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
product sales allowances we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  returns  coupons  medicaid discounts and managed care and governmental contracts 
in addition to these product sales allowances  in the first quarter of we also began recording an allowance to product sales for wholesaler discount reserves 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
prompt payment discounts we offer our us wholesaler customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on all us sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from our accrual amount 
wholesaler discounts in the third quarter of  we finalized wholesaler service agreements with a number of our wholesaler customers that provide our wholesalers with the opportunity to earn up to in additional discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
these agreements are effective from january  we have therefore recorded a provision equal to of us gross sales for the twelve months ended december  in addition  at our discretion  we may provide additional discounts to wholesalers such as the discounts of million that were provided and recorded during the first quarter of actual discounts provided could therefore exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected discounts 
if these discounts were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for provigil is years  gabitril is to years  depending on product strength  and actiq is to years 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacies are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
in  we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales  which is consistent with our actual historical return percentages 
the other factors described above did not have a significant impact in on our estimate of product returns 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
based on fourth quarter sales  we believe a reasonable estimate of our maximum exposure for potential returns related to product in our supply pipeline as of december  is approximately million for provigil  million for actiq and million for gabitril 
coupons we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free samples of our products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
in  we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
in  we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
in  certain medicaid drug rebate program participants will be transitioned to the part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of we believe the impact of this transition will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
managed care and governmental contracts we have entered into agreements with certain managed care customers whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on sales volume 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of sales volume of these managed care customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we have entered into agreements with certain governmental customers other than medicaid whereby we provide legislatively mandated discounts and rebates to such entities 
we record accruals for these discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount amounts and expected levels of performance of these governmental customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical sales amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
generally  discounts are granted to governmental customers by our wholesalers at time of purchase 
in other cases  rebates are paid directly to governmental customers based on reported levels of patient usage 
wholesalers charge these discounts and rebates back to us generally within one to three months 
we record accruals for our estimate of unprocessed chargebacks related to sales made during the period based on an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s sales  plus an accrual based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel 
in  we recorded a provision for managed care and governmental contracts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual chargebacks and rebates could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
if the chargebacks and rebates provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
the following table summarizes activity in each of the above categories for the years ended december  and in thousands prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts managed care governmental contracts total balance at january     provision current period     prior periods   total      actual current period     prior periods     total       balance at december     provision current period      prior periods   total      actual current period      prior periods      total       balance at december      given our return goods policy  we assume that all returns in a current year relate to prior period sales 
includes beginning reserve balances related to trisenox  which was acquired in the third quarter of  of million for prompt payment discounts and million for returns 
inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on domestic inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
for the majority of our foreign inventories  the first in  first out fifo method is utilized 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
we had million and million of capitalized inventory costs for pre launch products for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have committed to make future minimum payments to third parties for certain raw material inventories 
the minimum purchase commitments total million as of december   the majority of which relate to modafinil and armodafinil 
we expect to fully utilize these contracts 
valuation of property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we regularly assess our property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets to determine whether any impairment in these assets may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
in the case of intangibles and other long lived assets  we assess whether triggering events have occurred and if so  we compare the estimated cash flows of the related asset group and compare it to the book value of the asset group 
calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies with respect to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
prior to  we had a history of losses from our operations  which generated significant international  federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if we believe that we are not likely to realize future tax benefits 
based on our profitability for the year ended december  and projected future results  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was likely that we would be able to realize a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  and therefore  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
as a result  beginning in  we began providing for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period  as it has for the current year ended december  based on our profitability for the year ended december   projected future results  and resolution of several generic challenges  during the fourth quarter of we concluded that it was likely that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
therefore  we again reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
at the end of  we retained a valuation allowance of million  against a total deferred tax asset balance of million  composed entirely of state and foreign net operating losses  and state tax credits 
we will continue to review and analyze the likelihood of realizing tax benefits related to deferred tax assets as there is more certainty surrounding our future levels of profitability related to specific company operations and the related taxing jurisdictions 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in march  the fasb issued final guidance that clarifies how companies should account for conditional asset retirement obligations

this guidance requires companies to recognize liabilities for these obligations 
we have adopted fin at december  this interpretation did not have a material effect on the financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
