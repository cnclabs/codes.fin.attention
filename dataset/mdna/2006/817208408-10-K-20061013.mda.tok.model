overview we are a development stage company 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues for approximately the next one to three years  during which time we will engage in significant research and development efforts 
however  we have entered into the harris moran license  the arborgen agreement  the cal west license  the scotts license  and the broin agreement to develop and commercialize our technology in certain varieties of lettuce  melons  trees  alfalfa  bedding plants  turf grass  and ethanol 
the harris moran license  the cal west license  and the scotts license also provide for royalty payments to us upon commercial introduction 
the arborgen agreement contains an option for arborgen to execute a license to commercialize developed products  which arborgen has notified us of their intention to execute  and upon the execution of a license agreement  we will receive a license fee and royalties from arborgen 
the cal west license contains an option for cal west to develop our technology in various other forage crops 
the broin license provides for annual payments for each of broin s ethanol production facilities that incorporates our technology 
we also have entered into the rahan joint venture to develop and commercialize our technology in banana plants 
in connection with the rahan joint venture  we will receive of the profits from the sale of enhanced banana plants 
consistent with our commercialization strategy  we intend to attract other companies interested in strategic partnerships or licensing our technology that may result in additional license fees  revenues from contract research and other related revenues 
successful future operations will depend on our and our partners ability to transform our research and development activities into a commercially feasible technology 
we plan to employ the same partnering strategy in both the human health and agricultural target markets 
our preclinical research has yielded data that we have presented to various biopharmaceutical companies that may be prospective licensees for the development and marketing of potential applications of our technology 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we record revenue under technology license and development agreements related to the following 
actual fees received may vary from the recorded estimated revenues 
nonrefundable upfront license fees that are received in exchange for the transfer of our technology to licensees  for which no further obligations to the licensee exist with respect to the basic technology transferred  are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or collections are assured 
nonrefundable upfront license fees that are received in connection with agreements that include time based payments are  together with the time based payments  deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated research period of the license 
milestone payments  which are contingent upon the achievement of certain research goals  are recognized as revenue when the milestones  as defined in the particular agreement  are achieved 
the effect of any change in revenues from technology license and development agreements would be reflected in revenues in the period such determination was made 
historically  no such adjustments have been made 
estimates of expenses our research and development agreements with third parties provide for an estimate of our expenses and costs  which are variable and are based on the actual services performed by the third party 
we estimate the aggregate amount of the expenses based upon the projected amounts that are set forth in the agreements  and we accrue the expenses for which we have not yet been invoiced 
in estimating the expenses  we consider  among other things  the following factors the existence of any prior relationship between us and the third party provider  the past results of prior research and development services performed by the third party provider  and the scope and timing of the research and development services set forth in the agreement with the third party provider 
after the research services are performed and we are invoiced  we make any adjustments that are necessary to accurately report research and development expense for the period 
valuation allowances and carrying values we have recorded valuation allowances against our entire deferred tax assets of  at june  the valuation allowances relate primarily to the net operating loss carryforward deferred tax asset where the tax benefit of such asset is not assured 
as of june   we have determined that the estimated future discounted cash flows related to our patent applications will be sufficient to recover their carrying value 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
stock based compensation we adopted fas no 
r  share based payments  effective july   using the modified retrospective method 
the adoption of this standard requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to july   we followed accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized related to the company s stock options granted to employees and directors  as all options had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in accordance with the modified retrospective method  we have adjusted previously reported results to reflect the effect of expensing those stock options 
the cumulative adjustment associated with the adoption of the modified retrospective method increased capital in excess of par and deficit accumulated during the development stage by  as of june  research program we do not expect to generate significant revenues for approximately the next one to three years  during which time we will engage in significant research and development efforts 
we expect to spend significant amounts on the research and development of our technology 
we also expect our research and development costs to increase as we continue to develop and ultimately commercialize our technology 
however  the successful development and commercialization of our technology is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and expenses of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our technology  or the period in which material net cash inflows may commence from the commercialization of our technology  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our research activities  the interim results of our research  the expense of additional research that may be required after review of the interim results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
liquidity and capital resources overview as of june   our cash balance and investments totaled  and we had working capital of  in addition  upon the closing of our private equity financing on october   we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately  as of june   we had a federal tax loss carryforward of approximately  and a state tax loss carry forward of approximately  to offset future taxable income 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of any or all of such tax loss carryforwards  if at all  in future fiscal years 
contractual obligations the following table lists our cash contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years research and development agreements facility  rent and operating leases employment  consulting and scientific advisory board agreements total contractual cash obligations certain of our research and development agreements disclosed herein provide that payment is to be made in canadian dollars and  therefore  the contractual obligations are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate 
the lease for our office space in new brunswick  new jersey is subject to certain escalations for our proportionate share of increases in the building s operating costs 
certain of our employment and consulting agreements provide for automatic renewal  which is not reflected in the table  unless terminated earlier by the parties to the respective agreements 
includes  for a research agreement extension that was not effective until september  we expect our capital requirements to increase significantly over the next several years as we commence new research and development efforts  increase our business and administrative infrastructure and embark on developing in house business capabilities and facilities 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the levels and costs of our research and development initiatives and the cost and timing of the expansion of our business development and administrative staff 
effective september   we extended our research and development agreement with the university of waterloo for an additional one year period through august   in the amount of can  or approximately us  research and development expenses under this agreement for the years ended june  and aggregated us  and us  respectively  and us  for the cumulative period through june  capital resources since inception  we have generated revenues of  in connection with the initial fees and milestone payments received under our license and development agreements 
we have not been profitable since inception  we will continue to incur additional operating losses in the future  and we will require additional financing to continue the development and subsequent commercialization of our technology 
while we do not expect to generate significant revenues from the licensing of our technology for the next one to three years  we may enter into additional licensing or other agreements with marketing and distribution partners that may result in additional license fees  receive revenues from contract research  or other related revenue 
on october   we completed a private placement to certain members of our board of directors  institutional and accredited investors for an aggregate amount of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for the aggregate net cash consideration of approximately  the private placement offered units of one share of common stock and a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock at a price equal to per unit 
the warrant was offered with an exercise price equal to per share  with such warrant becoming exercisabe six months from the date of closing 
the estimated costs associated with the private placement totaled approximately we anticipate that  based upon our current cash and investments  we will be able to fund our operations at least through june  over the next twelve months  we plan to fund our research and development and commercialization activities by i utilizing our current cash balance and investments  ii achieving some of the milestones set forth in our current licensing agreements  iii through the execution of additional licensing agreements for our technology  and iv through a sale of our securities 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue total revenues consisted of initial fees and milestone payments on our agricultural development and license agreements 
during the years ended june  and  revenue of  and  consisted of the amortized portion of the initial fee and milestone payments in connection with the scotts development and license agreement and a milestone payment in connection with the arborgen agreement 
during the year ended june   revenue of  consisted of the amortized portion of the initial fee in connection with the scotts development and license agreement 
we anticipate that we will continue to receive milestone payments in connection with our current agricultural development and license agreements while we continue to pursue our goal of attracting other companies to license our technologies in various other crops 
additionally  we anticipate that we will receive royalty payments from our license agreements when our partners commercialize their crops containing our technology 
however  it is difficult for us to determine our future revenue expectations because we are a development stage biotechnology company 
as such  the timing and outcome of our experiments  the timing of signing new partners and the timing of our partners moving through the development process into commercialization is difficult to accurately predict 
operating expenses year ended june  change change in thousands  except values general and administrative research and development total operating expenses we expect operating expenses to increase over the next twelve months as we anticipate that research and development expenses and other general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our research and development activities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of the following year ended june  in thousands stock based compensation payroll and benefits investor relations professional fees other general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses stock based compensation consists primarily of the amortized portion of the black scholes value of options and warrants previously granted to consultants  directors and employees as well as those granted during each of fiscal  and during fiscal and   and  options and warrants granted  the black scholes value for  and  of such options and warrants  respectively  were allocated to general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the options were allocated to research and development expenses 
the black scholes value of the options and warrants granted during fiscal were lower than fiscal because the market price of the common stock on the date of grant in fiscal was lower than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant in fiscal stock based compensation was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a warrant that was granted in connection with a financial advisory agreement in fiscal that had a black scholes value of approximately payroll and benefits increased primarily as a result of salary and health insurance rate increases 
investor relations expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of investor relations consulting fees 
professional fees increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in legal fees due to the increased regulatory environment  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounting and consulting fees as a result of the postponement by the sec of the auditing requirements in connection with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
professional fees increased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in consulting fees incurred in connection with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which was offset by a decrease in legal fees primarily as a result of greater efficiencies in the preparation and review of our forms and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we expect general and administrative expenses to modestly increase over the next twelve months primarily due to an increase in legal and accounting fees related to the increased regulatory environment 
research and development expenses year ended june  change change in thousands  except values stock based compensation other research and development total research and development stock based compensation decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because the black scholes value of the options and warrants granted during fiscal were lower than fiscal because the market price of the common stock on the date of grant in fiscal was lower than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant in fiscal stock based compensation increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to previously issued options becoming exercisable and new options being issued during fiscal other research and development costs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal and during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the expanded research programs in both the agricultural and human health applications of our technology and the weakness of the us currency against the canadian currency 
the breakdown of our research and development expenses between our agricultural and human health research programs are as follows year ended june  in thousands  except values agricultural research programs human health research programs total research and development expenses we expect the percentage of human health research programs to increase as a percentage of the total research and development expenses as we continue to expand our human health initiatives 
noncash income in february and in may  we completed separate private placements of common stock and warrants 
in each of the private placements  we were obligated to file a registration statement to register all of the shares and the shares underlying the warrants 
due to our obligation to file a registration to register for resale the shares underlying the warrants  in accordance with eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own common stock  the value of the warrants in each private placement was recorded as a liability until each filing was made 
the decrease in market value of the common stock from the closing of each of the financings until the date of the filing or effectiveness of the registration statements resulted in noncash income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal sale of state income tax loss during each of fiscal and fiscal  we received net proceeds of  and  from the sale of our new jersey state tax loss for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
because the criteria required for approval changed  we were not approved to sell our new jersey state tax loss for fiscal and therefore  we did not receive any proceeds during fiscal during fiscal  the criteria required for approval changed again 
therefore  in june  we again applied to sell our new jersey state tax loss for fiscal  as well as our new jersey state tax loss for fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will be approved to sell our new jersey state tax losses for fiscal and fiscal interest income year ended june  change change in thousands  except values interest income the increase in interest income for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal is related to a higher rate of interest earned on our investments 
from inception on july  through june  from inception of operations on july  through june   we had revenues of  which consisted of the initial license fees and milestone payments in connection with our various development and license agreements 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues for approximately the next one to three years  during which time we will engage in significant research and development efforts 
we have incurred losses each year since inception and have an accumulated deficit of  at june  we expect to continue to incur losses as a result of expenditures on research  product development and administrative activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our financial statements are denominated in united states dollars and  except for our agreement with the university of waterloo  which is denominated in canadian dollars  all of our contracts are denominated in united states dollars 
therefore  we believe that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not result in any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event we derive a greater portion of our revenues from international operations or in the event a greater portion of our expenses are incurred internationally and denominated in a foreign currency  then changes in foreign currency exchange rates could effect our results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  federal agency notes  corporate debt securities and united states treasury notes  with an effective duration of the portfolio of less than nine months  and no security with an effective duration in excess of two years  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  which we plan to hold until maturity  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
