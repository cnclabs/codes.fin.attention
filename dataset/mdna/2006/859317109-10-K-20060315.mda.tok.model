item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides management s analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of sterling financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of lancaster county  na  first national bank of north east  bank of hanover and trust company  pennsylvania state bank  delaware sterling bank trust company  hovb investment co  t c leasing  inc t c  pennbanks insurance company  spc  church capital management llc  bainbridge securities  inc  corporate healthcare strategies  llc d b a stoudt advisors  lancaster insurance group  llc and sterling mortgage services  inc inactive 
the consolidated financial statements also include town country leasing  llc  sterling financial trust company  equipment finance llc  and sterling community development corporation  llc all wholly owned subsidiaries of bank of lancaster county 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company with a primary focus on sterling s performance 
critical accounting policies sterling s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles require management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by sterling are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   sterling is no longer required to amortize goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
sterling tests for impairment based on the goodwill 
back to contents maintained at each defined reporting unit 
various market valuation methodologies are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  an impairment expense may be required to be recorded to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
sterling completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this management discussion and analysis 
non gaap presentations this management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure that we believe provides readers with important information regarding sterling s operational efficiency 
comparison of sterling s efficiency ratio with other companies may not be appropriate  as they may calculate their efficiency ratio in a different manner 
the efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense  less depreciation on operating leases  by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income  less depreciation on operating leases 
sterling nets the depreciation on operating leases against related income  as it is consistent with utilizing net interest income presentation for comparable capital leases  which nets interest expense against interest income 
the efficiency ratio excludes unusual items  such as gains losses on securities activities  interest collected on charged off loans  etc 
return on realized equity is a non gaap financial measure  as it is calculated by taking net income  divided by average stockholders equity  excluding average other accumulated comprehensive income 
we believe the presentation of return on realized equity provides a reader with a better understanding of our financial performance based on economic transactions  as it excludes the impact of unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and derivatives used in cash flow hedges  which can fluctuate based on interest rate volatility 
return on tangible equity is a non gaap financial measure  as it is calculated by taking net income excluding the amortization of intangible assets  divided by average stockholders equity less average goodwill and intangible assets 
we believe that by excluding the impact of purchase accounting  the return on average tangible equity provides the reader with an important view of our financial performance 
sterling  in referring to its net income  is referring to income determined in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
inflation and interest rates the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on non interest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
during the past several years  the federal reserve has been very active in monitoring economic data  and has used interest rates to help stimulate economic growth and control inflation 
starting in  short term interest rates decreased  with sharp reductions in and more modest reductions in and however  in june  the federal reserve began a measured effort to control inflationary pressures and has raised the federal funds rate thirteen times in basis points increments 
management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance 

back to contents results of operations all dollar amounts presented within tables are in thousands  except per share data 
executive overview sterling s executive management team and board of directors have identified three performance measurements that they feel are key elements for enhancing shareholder value 
these include increasing earnings per share  increasing return on realized equity  and decreasing the efficiency ratio 
the primary source of sterling s revenues are net interest income derived from loans and investments  less their deposit and borrowing funding costs  as well as fees from financial services provided to customers  including rental income on operating leases 
revenues are influenced by general economic factors  including market interest rates  the economy of the markets served  stock market conditions  as well as competitive forces within the markets 
sterling s overall strategy is to enhance growth in existing markets and affiliates through the leveraging of existing resources  and complement this growth with new products and services 
this strategy has resulted in net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to million  or per diluted share in  and million  or per diluted share in these results represent a increase in diluted earnings per diluted share in over results  and a increase in over results 
return on average realized equity decreased to in  compared to and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in return on average realized equity  despite an increase in earnings  is due to an increase in stockholders equity that resulted from the issuance of stock to acquire corporate healthcare strategies d b a stoudtadvisors and pennsylvania state bank in and the related impact of purchase accounting 
return on average tangible equity was in  compared to in and in net interest income increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million in  a increase 
while pennsylvania state bank contributed million to this increase  growth in commercial loans  consumer loans  and finance receivables contributed to the remaining million or 
net interest income in increased million from million in the net interest margin for was at as compared to and in and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses was million for both years ended december  and and million for the year ended non interest income  excluding securities gains  was million for the year ended december   a increase over the million earned in sterling s banking segment non interest income increased million  or 
the acquisition of pennsylvania state bank contributed approximately  to the growth 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to deposit growth and the implementation of an overdraft protection program during the fourth quarter of sterling s financial services segments non interest income increased million  or in the acquisition of corporate healthcare strategies d b a stoudt advisors in june contributed million to the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to higher rental income on operating leases of million and an increase of approximately million in gains on sales of finance receivables 
non interest income excluding securities gains increased million  or  in when compared to the acquisitions of church capital  bainbridge securities  and stoudtadvisors favorably impacted non interest income during this period 
securities gains were  in  compared to million in and  in gains and losses on securities are realized as part of ongoing asset liability management and to fund investments in future strategies 
non interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in in  the incremental expenses associated with pennsylvania state bank  corporate healthcare strategies and lancaster insurance group in  versus a partial year in represents million of the increase 

back to contents as a result of the growth sterling has experienced in its revenues over the past several years  non interest expense has also increased 
the increase in revenues that sterling has experienced can be attributed to our relationship management model  which has resulted in new customer relationships  new financial services products being offered to meet their needs and expansion of our market into new geographic regions 
these efforts have resulted in increases in salaries and employee benefits  higher occupancy and equipment charges and other non interest expenses 
also  intangible asset amortization has increased as a direct result of the identifiable intangible assets that resulted from the corporate healthcare strategies  llc and pennsylvania state bank acquisitions 
sterling s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   of was approximately basis points lower than the efficiency ratio of  despite the growth of our financial services affiliates  which generally operate at higher efficiency ratio levels than our banking affiliates 
a more thorough discussion of sterling s results of operations is included in the following pages 
net interest income the primary component of sterling s revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and fees on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits  borrowed funds and subordinated debt 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
due to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
table below presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and table below analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest income of million from to reflects a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
margin decreased basis points from to 
pennsylvania state bank  acquired by sterling on december   contributed million of the increase in net interest income and million of the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
in addition  the acquisition of pennsylvania state bank negatively impacted sterling s net interest margin by basis points 
the overall increase in interest earning assets came in the form of loans 
in fact  the growth in loans exceeded the growth in earning assets  reflecting the funding of a portion of the loan growth with securities portfolio cash flows over the past year 
strong growth in the commercial loan and finance receivable portfolios as well as consumer loans contributed to the increase in total loans 
year over year  average loans increased million  or including million from pennsylvania state bank  increasing the percentage of loans to interest earning assets from in to in generally  loans carry a higher yield than alternative interest earning assets  namely securities and other investments 
the growth in loans was primarily funded by growth in deposits 
average deposits increased by million  or  with pennsylvania state bank contributing million to the increase 
sterling also experienced strong organic growth in deposits resulting from its customer relationship model approach and from its overall market position in attractive markets 
growth has been experienced in non maturity accounts and time deposits 
this growth has shifted the mix in the deposit base to higher costing funds 
specifically  money market accounts increased from to of total deposits and time deposits increased from to from december  to december  
back to contents year over year  average total borrowings increased million  or 
this net increase reflects two issuances of junior subordinated debentures  one in december and another in february  totaling million 
in addition  borrowed funds increased as a result of the million of borrowings acquired with pa state bank offset by contractual maturities and amortization  as well as the prepayment of a million fhlb advance in the third quarter of strong deposit growth and effective management of the investment securities portfolio precluded the need to replace the majority of this funding and effective management of the investment securities portfolio 
net interest margin decreased to from resulting from a number of factors after over three years of declining short term interest rates  the federal reserve bank began to raise the fed funds target rate in since june of  the federal reserve has increased the fed funds target by basis points on thirteen separate occasions 
this increase in short term rates is generally favorable due to sterling s modest asset sensitive interest rate risk position 
however  the flattening and ultimate inversion of the yield curve  with long term rates having increased at a slower pace over the same time period  has had a dampening effect on the generally favorable impact of the increase in short term rates 
a flat inverted yield curve diminishes the opportunity to earn a spread on new business with longer term rates generally driving loan originations and shorter term rates driving funding costs 
the following table depicts the spread between the two and the ten year treasuries at the end of the past eight quarters quarter ended march bps bps june bps bps september bps bps december bps bps by contrast  over the last three decades  the average spread between the two and the ten year treasuries was approximately basis points 
as noted previously  growth in loans has accounted for all of the growth in earning assets 
generally  loans carry a higher yield than alternative interest earning assets  namely securities and other investments 
thus this improved mix of earning assets has helped to increase the overall yield on earning assets by basis points from to going forward  sterling s ability to fund a portion of loan growth with a decrease in investment securities is expected to diminish as a result of sterling s need to maintain certain levels of securities to be available as collateral to be pledged for business purposes 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to  exceeding the increase in the yield on earning assets 
the increase in the cost of funds for sterling had lagged the increase in the yield on earning assets through the first part of the increase in the cost of funds thereafter has resulted from both a general trend of increases in the rates paid on deposit accounts  as well as a shift in the funding mix with an increasing percentage of deposit growth coming from comparatively higher yielding money market and time deposits 
the combination of the above factors contributed to a narrowing of the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points from to offsetting this narrowing spread was growth in non interest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  both of which are interest free sources of funding that helped minimize the decline in margin to basis points 
the increase in fully tax equivalent net interest income of million from to reflects both an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as an basis points increase in net interest margin 

back to contents several factors had an impact on s results relative to improved earning asset mix with strong growth in commercial loans and finance receivables funded in large part by securities portfolio cash flow and overnight fed funds  growth in lower cost demand and savings deposits  downward repricing of cd portfolio  leveraging of trust preferred proceeds with borrowings of million  less reliance on third party borrowings to fund growth in both finance receivables and operating leases  and expanded use of off balance sheet instruments to manage sterling s interest rate risk position by adding million of swaps 
going forward  sterling s ability to maintain its historically strong growth trend in net interest income will be challenged by an expected modest pressure in its net interest margin 
this pressure can be attributed to several factors sterling s ability to fund a portion of its loan growth with cash flow from its securities portfolio is expected to diminish due to the need to maintain certain levels of specific securities for collateral pledging purposes 
although sterling is slightly asset sensitive to rising interest rates  a prolonged flat inverted yield curve will lead to pressure on our ability to attract new business at historical margin levels 
sterling s ability to lag increases in its deposit ratios may diminish over time as continued increases in interest rates make it challenging to sterling to achieve its desired deposit growth targets

non interest income consistent with sterling s recent strategy of broadening its financial services offered to its customers through the acquisition of fee based companies and the development of new products  non interest income continues to show steady increases over the past several years 
as a result  sterling has been able to increase its non interest income  excluding securities gains losses  as a percent of total net interest income and non interest 
back to contents income to  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these percentages also include netting depreciation on operating income with related income

other service charges  commissions and fees were million for the year ended december   compared to million in the growth in exceeded the growth in significant increases were debit card fees  atm surcharges and check processing fee income 
during sterling was able to increase the use of debit cards through a special customer initiative 
sterling increased the surcharge on its atm s during in addition  fees received for processing of sterling s official checks increased as a result of higher volumes and higher interest rates 
brokerage fees and commissions totaled million for the year ended december   down from million in and up from million in unfavorable market conditions have resulted in decreased brokerage volume 
insurance commissions and fees were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the acquisition of corporate healthcare strategies in the second quarter of and the acquisition of the remaining interest in lancaster insurance group in the third quarter of were the primary factors contributing to the increase 
in  one of our key insurance carriers vacated the small group health insurance market  thereby negatively impacting customer retention and related insurance commissions

mortgage banking income was million in  an increase of from million in  and down from million in the increase in mortgage banking revenue in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease of  in the valuation reserve 
the decrease in from was the result of lower production and sales volume arising from a generally higher interest rate environment in and the resulting reduction in refinancing activities

non interest expense total non interest expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or over million in this followed a million  or  increase in over s non interest expenses of million 
in general terms  the increases experienced by sterling are largely attributable to the acquisitions completed during this time period 
consistent with the accounting rules surrounding purchase accounting  expenses are included in sterling s results of operations after the acquisition is completed 
as such  expenses related to church capital and bainbridge are included from october and forward  expenses of corporate healthcare strategies are included from june and forward  and sterling s most recent acquisition  pennsylvania state bank  is included from december  and forward 

back to contents table non interest expense versus versus amount amount salaries and employee benefits net occupancy furniture equipment professional services depreciation on operating lease assets taxes other than income intangible asset amortization other total the largest component of non interest expense is salaries and employee benefits  which totaled million for the year ended december   a million or increase over  after increasing million or in the increase was attributable to the following factors a full year of salaries and benefits associated with church capital management and bainbridge securities in and as compared to two and one half months in  a full year of salaries and benefits associated with corporate healthcare strategies and pennsylvania state bank as compared to seven months associated with corporate healthcare strategies  six months associated with lancaster insurance group and approximately one month associated with pennsylvania state bank in with no similar expense in  increased number of employees  the result of office expansion including pennsterling bank and delaware sterling bank trust company initiatives  and expansion in carroll county  maryland  additions to staff required to continue to serve our customers in light of increased transaction volumes  increased healthcare costs that have resulted from a growing employee base  as well as nationwide trends of increasing employee benefits costs  and normal merit increases to existing employees 
net occupancy expense increased to million in up from million in and million in this increase is a direct result of the addition of pennsylvania state bank in december  overall other growth of the company  including expansion into the emerging markets of berks county  pennsylvania  carroll county  maryland  and new castle county  delaware 
in addition  renovations were made to existing locations  which resulted in additional occupancy changes 
sterling s new affiliates have office space that also contributed to an increase in occupancy charges 
furniture and equipment charges were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the steady upward trend in furniture and equipment expense is the result of enhancements to the channels available to deliver products and services to customers 
additionally  certain equipment charges are based on the number of accounts opened and their transaction volumes 
as sterling s customer base continues to grow  these types of charges grow as well 
the increase in number of office locations  as well as renovations made to existing offices also contributed to the increase 
professional services totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million in  and million in professional services fees decreased from to primarily due to a decrease in fees associated with the compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of during sterling incurred various non recurring expenses related to the implementation of the compliance required under sarbanes oxley 

back to contents taxes other than income were million for the year ended december   an increase from million  or  in and million in taxes other than income consist primarily of taxes based on stockholders equity 
as a result of the growing equity base of sterling s affiliates  including the bank affiliates  combined with the acquisition of companies subject to similar taxes  the taxes other than income expense has increased over the past several years 
in connection with sterling s acquisitions  several identifiable intangible assets were acquired  the most significant of which was customer lists and core deposit intangibles 
the increase in related expenses was the direct result of the timing of the acquisitions 
included in was a full year of intangible amortization for corporate healthcare strategies and pennsylvania state bank as opposed to seven months of amortization for corporate healthcare strategies and one month for pennsylvania state bank in management anticipates amortization expense related to these acquisitions will decrease  as the assets are being amortized on an accelerated method 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other non interest expense totaled million in  compared to million in and million in expenses in this category consist of marketing  advertising  promotions  postage  lending related expenses  insurance and telephone expenses 
the primary increase in other non interest expenses is a function of sterling s overall growth  which results in higher expenses 
operating expense levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses non interest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and non interest income excluding gains 
in calculating its efficiency ratio  sterling nets depreciation on operating leases with the related rental income to more consistently present operating results with the presentation used in the banking industry 
sterling s efficiency ratio improved to for the year ended december  from in and slipped from in sterling s effective management of expenses lead to an improving efficiency ratio in despite the impact of higher intangible amortization  expansion into new markets and territories and the acquisition growth of non bank affiliates which generally carry higher expense to revenue ratios than bank affiliates 
income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in income tax expense was consistent with the higher levels of pre tax income 
a more meaningful comparison is the effective tax rate  a measurement of income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income  which was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sterling s effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income  dividends paid deduction and tax credits associated with low income housing projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
the effective tax rate was favorably influenced by the successful resolution of an uncertain tax position 
excluding the resolution of the uncertain tax position  the effective rate would have been 
the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily related to higher levels of pre tax income taxed at the incremental statutory tax rate and tax free income representing less of pre tax income than in and financial condition total assets were approximately billion in  representing growth compared to billion  or growth in in december  sterling acquired pennsylvania state bank  which contributed million of the increase over sterling s loan growth was in and in  which outpaced total asset growth 
as part of an overall strategy to increase the return on equity of the corporation  the remaining growth in assets and more specifically loans  was funded by growth in average deposits  and supplemented with a reduction in the average level of federal funds sold and the cash flows from the investment securities portfolio 

back to contents securities sterling utilizes investment securities as a primary tool for managing interest rate risk  to generate interest and dividend income  to provide liquidity and to provide collateral for certain deposits and borrowings 
as of december   securities totaled million  which represented a decrease of million or from the december  balance of million 
during  net cash flows from investment securities were used to fund a portion of the loan growth generated by the company 
proceeds from maturities  sales and calls totaled million 
purchases of million were completed primarily to meet pledging requirements 
the activity discussed above most significantly increased holdings of agency securities and decreased holdings of corporate securities 
this shift was a result of a number of factors  including a continued effort to reduce the credit risk associated with corporate securities and a need to maintain a sufficient level of securities that are qualified to serve as collateral for public fund and other deposits requiring pledged securities 
in addition to the cash flow activity noted above  the decrease in the portfolio reflected a reduction in the balance of net unrealized gains 
at december   the securities balance included net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of million versus net unrealized gains of million at december  the decrease in unrealized gains resulted primarily from higher interest rates at year end versus year end higher interest rates generally decrease the value of debt securities 
sterling s securities portfolio includes debt and equity instruments that are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk 
this risk arises from general market conditions  factors impacting specific industries  as well as corporate news that may impact specific issues 
management continuously monitors its debt securities  including routine updating of credit ratings  monitoring market  industry and corporate news  as well as volatility in market prices 
sterling uses various indicators in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired  including whether it is probable that the contractual interest and principal will not be collected in full 
one such indicator is credit ratings 
as of december   there were no holdings below investment grade

over the past five years  sterling has been able to generate loan growth through acquisitions of companies  including pennsylvania state bank in december  and equipment finance llc in february  and through entrance into new markets  including berks county  pennsylvania  carroll county  maryland  and new castle county  delaware 
in addition  the improvement in the local and national economies and our relationship management model has led to organic growth within the existing franchises 
commercial real estate and construction increased million  or  finance receivables increased million  or  consumer loans increased million  or  and mortgage loans increased million  or 
the increases were partially offset by decreases of million  or in commercial and agricultural loans  million  or in financial loans and million  or in lease financings 
the specialty lenders  including equipment finance and town country leasing  have continued their momentum of growing finance receivables and finance leases  achieving a combined growth in a primary reason for equipment finance s decision to join sterling was the funding that sterling could provide in order to increase its market share 
since sterling s acquisition in february  equipment finance has been able to capture new business and increase its finance receivables outstanding 
town country leasing s additions to the sales force have led to new business opportunities  and similar to the growth in commercial loans  customers have made capital expenditures to benefit from the low interest rate environment 
a portion of the growth experienced in lease financing receivables in previous years was the result of certain customers  who in the past preferred an operating lease  favored finance leases to capitalize on bonus accelerated tax depreciation

asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania  northern maryland  and northern delaware 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
sterling s finance receivables are primarily to customers in the eastern part of the united states to finance forestry and land clearing equipment 
non performing assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms that it otherwise would not have granted originally 

back to contents table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans accruing loans  past due days or more restructured loans total non performing loans foreclosed assets total non performing assets nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   non performing assets were million  an increase of  or from december  included in the totals are million of non performing assets acquired by sterling in connection with the acquisition of pennsylvania state bank in december non accrual loans increased by  or on a year over year basis 
however  the ratio of non performing assets to total loans remained relatively stable between periods 
sterling continues to experience strong credit quality  as evidenced by improving trends in the asset quality ratios depicted above 
this is a direct result of strong underwriting standards and diligence in managing past due and potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans  which have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and which may result in the reporting of these loans as non performing loans in the future 
total potential problem loans were approximately million at december  and million at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately  could result in potential problem loans  if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by a combination of business assets and or real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
quarterly  sterling utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of limits as dictated by internal credit policies 
using migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  problem loans and potential problem loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  
back to contents estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor based on historical performance to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience  ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  and other factors as management may deem appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria potential for the lack of precision in the company s allowance for loan loss loan assessment  other potential exposures in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management believes this methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates this methodology  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 

back to contents a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  beginning balance allowance acquired in acquisition loans charged off during year commercial and agricultural commercial real estate real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural commercial real estate real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan losses reserve on loan commitments transferred to other liabilities balance at end of year ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the allowance represents of loans outstanding at december   and represents a slight increase in reserve levels to outstanding loans 
despite the relative stability of non performing assets to total loans  sterling recorded its provision for loan losses of million for  as compared to million for certain factors  including a change in the methodology detailed in the next section of this report  have also led to the increase in the allowance for loan losses 
the level of provision expense and the resultant allowance for loan losses are deemed adequate by management given the growth in sterling s loan portfolio and current mix of loans 

back to contents table allocation of allowance for loan losses years ended december  amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans amount loans to total loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage and construction consumer leases finance receivables unallocated total the allocation of the allowance for loan losses between the various loan portfolios has changed over the past few years  consistent with the historical net loss experience in each of the portfolios 
additionally  management periodically reviews the methodology  and may make revisions to ensure it continues to reflect the losses inherent in the portfolio 
during the third quarter of  management reevaluated and made certain modifications to its methodology in establishing its reserve to account for changing risks inherent in its loan portfolio 
these modifications included the broadening of allocation percentages related to qualitative factors 
the basis for the widening of the allocation of qualitative factors included the following composition mix of the loan portfolio  which include greater percentages of commercial lending and leasing  and away from more traditional consumer loan types  greater instances of unsecured credits and credits secured by current assets  such as accounts receivable and inventory  and less instances of loans fully secured by real estate  geographic mix of loans  which includes entrance into emerging markets  where sterling has less experience and insight compared to its historical footprint  greater reliance on individual loan officers and credit personnel at the bank affiliates to enforce underwriting standards and policy  as decisions continue to be made in the markets served  rather than in a centralized location  and higher legal lending limits  allowing sterling to accommodate larger credit facilities with customers  which management believes carry a greater risk than smaller credits 
the allowance methodology was further enhanced as of september  changes only affected the commercial loan portfolios of sterling s affiliate banks 
previously the methodology applied a historic loss factor derived from a migration analysis of losses to the outstanding loan balances for all non classified credits 
no differentiation was made for different risk rating grades within these pools of loans 
the enhancement changed the employment of the historic loss factor and substituted new factors based on the profile of the loan pool by risk rating grade 
therefore loans secured by cash or properly margined securities would have little to no risk  while loans that were rated in lower pass or special mention categories would carry a higher provisioning factor to more accurately reflect the inherent risk in those loans 
management believes this enhanced methodology accurately reflects losses presently inherent in the portfolio and such enhancements do not impact the comparability of the periods presented above 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses and bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 

back to contents the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the reserve balance 
this reflects the continued higher level of net charge offs  increases in loans  entering new markets with new lenders  and changes in other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
this non homogeneous loan portfolio  along with leases  continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling 
these loans generally are larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors  such as competition for high rated credits  is also considered in allocating this reserve balance 
during and  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio increased consistent with the trends noted in lease charge offs during the last several years and continued uncertainty as to the impact of continued higher fuel costs on the transportation industry and other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
the unallocated portion of the allowance was greatly reduced by the enhancement to the methodology implemented in september the unallocated portion of the reserve results due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at the time 
while management believes sterling s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions and management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
assets held for operating leases assets held for operating leases were million at december   which exceeded the million at december  by million or 
the growth in operating leases during reflects the increased number of customers entering into operating leases rather than finance leases after the termination of the irs bonus depreciation at the end of operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if  at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk by establishing residual values very conservatively and through the use of anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
as a result of sterling s approach to managing residual risk  related residual losses have been immaterial historically 
other assets other assets increased approximately million or from prior year 
this is primarily due to increases in deposits for equipment purchases in our leasing division 
this increase is consistent with the growth the leasing division experienced in due to the increased customer demand for leases 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
total deposits grew from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
average deposits increased million  or 
pennsylvania state bank contributed million to this increase 
the remaining growth in deposits has generally been achieved through the continued expansion of branch facilities into new markets with emphasis on the growth of business deposit relationships and the development of products that meet the needs of sterling s bank affiliate customers

as of december   short term borrowings totaled million  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
this net increase is primarily attributable to development of sterling s correspondent services group whereby federal funds lines have been established for a number of community bank clients  the utilization of short term borrowings from the fhlb as part of a strategy to replace maturing fhlb advances with anticipated deposit growth  and a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements  which is a fluctuation experienced in the normal course of business 
long term debt long term debt consists primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank and borrowings from other financial institutions to fund sterling s growth in its finance receivable and finance and operating lease portfolios 
long term debt totaled million at december   a net decrease of million from the december  balance of million 
generally  strong deposit growth provided sufficient funding for asset growth  allowing for this net reduction in borrowings 
the net decrease specifically resulted from the following scheduled principal maturities and repayments of million  payoff of a million note payable due to mature in  payoff of a million fhlb advance due to mature in a prepayment penalty of  was incurred  and

asset liability management sterling enters into derivative transactions principally to manage the risk of price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and liabilities and on future cash flows 
a summary of the interest rate contracts is as follows december  december  notional amount carrying value notional amount carrying value interest rate swap agreements pay fixed receive floating pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps have been used to hedge cash flow variability related to floating rate assets and liabilities

fees collected from customers for these transactions are recognized over the life of the contract 
for the years ended december  and  fees of  and  are included in other non interest income 
sterling believes it has reduced market risk on its customer related derivative contracts through the offsetting contractual relationships with counterparties 
however  if a customer or counterparty fails to perform  credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
when the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive  this generally indicates that the counterparty or customer owes sterling  and results in credit risk to sterling 
when the fair value of a credit risk is negative  sterling owes the customer or counterparty  and therefore  has no credit risk 
sterling minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by including derivative credit risk in its credit underwriting procedures  and by entering into transactions with higher quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by sterling s treasury department 
capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
one capital management strategy that sterling has employed is the use of trust preferred capital securities through its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trusts  sterling financial statutory trust i  ii  iii and iv 
the proceeds from the preferred securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of sterling  at terms consistent with the trust preferred capital securities 
sterling s treatment of the preferred capital securities is consistent with long term debt  and the related dividends being presented as interest expense 
sterling s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling of the statutory trusts obligations under the preferred capital securities 
the capital securities held by the trusts qualify as tier capital for sterling under federal reserve board guidelines 
in  the federal reserve issued rules that retain tier capital treatment for trust preferred securities but with stricter limits 
under the new rules  after a five year transition period  the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would retain its current limit of of tier capital elements  net of goodwill 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
sterling has million in trust preferred securities as of december   which has been included as tier capital in its regulatory capital calculations 
sterling anticipates that upon adoption of the board of governors clarified regulatory treatment of trust preferred securities through  it will continue to be well capitalized 
earnings retention  net income less dividends declared  is another source of capital to sterling 
during  sterling retained million  or  of its net income

as of december    shares remain authorized for repurchase 
sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december  and  that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation  the banks were categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized institutions must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the following tables 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the banks category 
sterling s and the banks actual capital amounts and ratios as of december   and are also presented in the table

capital ratios improved due to sterling s strong financial performance in the year and the issuance of million of trust preferred securities  which currently qualify as tier capital 
liquidity effective liquidity management ensures that the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of sterling are met 
sterling s funds are available from a variety of sources  including assets that are readily convertible to cash federal funds sold  short term investments  securities portfolio  scheduled repayments of loan receivables  core deposit base  borrowing capacity short and long term with a number of correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank fhlb  the ability to package residential mortgage loans originated for sale and the ability to 
back to contents sell finance leases and receivables through our correspondent bank relationships 
as of december   sterling had unused funding commitments from these financial institutions and the fhlb totaling million 
the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s net cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks 
the total amount of dividends that may be paid from the subsidiary banks to sterling totaled million at december  sterling manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows and believes it has adequate funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements sterling enters into contractual obligations in its normal course of business to fund loan growth  for asset liability management purposes  to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
the following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date

derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts or payments based on market and interest rate conditions as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts can change daily as market and interest rate conditions fluctuate 
these derivative contracts require monthly cash settlement 
as the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet do not represent the amounts that will ultimately be paid under the contract  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations discussed above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a schedule of significant commitments at december  is as follows commitments to extend credit unused home equity lines of credit other commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit further discussion of these commitments to extend credit is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

sterling has no off balance sheet arrangements through the use of special purpose entities 

back to contents new financial accounting standards note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact on sterling s financial condition or results of operations for recently issued or proposed accounting standards that have not been adopted 
to the extent we anticipate a significant impact to sterling s financial condition or results of operations  appropriate discussion takes place in the applicable note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to sterling  as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling has minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the sterling s future earnings earnings at risk and value value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment  contractual interest rate changes  or the exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the primary objective of sterling s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate yet is not essential to sterling s profitability 
thus  the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
sterling s asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
sterling primarily uses the securities portfolios and borrowings to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
finally  sterling has utilized off balance sheet instruments to a limited degree to manage its interest rate risk position 
the asset liability committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the board of directors 
sterling uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of sterling s interest rate risk position over time 

back to contents earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of sterling s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period  with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in table a 
these results indicate that sterling would expect net interest income to remain unchanged over the next twelve months assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to decrease by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects an asset sensitive short term rate risk position and is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   annual net interest income was expected to increase by in the upward scenario and to decrease by in the downward scenario 
the risk position has changed from the prior year end to a less asset sensitive position primarily due to the growth in rate sensitive core deposit products and net federal funds purchased position  the rolling down of time deposit maturities and continued refinement of non maturity deposit assumptions relative to current interest rate environment  offset by continued growth in variable commercial loans 
value at risk the net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the net present value of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the net present value analysis results are presented in table b 
these results indicate that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to decrease 
if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of sterling is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   the analysis indicated that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner
