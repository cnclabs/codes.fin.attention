item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have derived the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three years ended december   and our financial condition as of each year end  from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with such financial statements 
overview we derive our revenues principally from the following net premiums earned  which comprises the premiums we earn from sales of automobile insurance policies less those premiums that we cede to our reinsurers  net investment income we earn on our invested assets  policy service fee revenues  which are composed primarily of policy origination fees and installment fees billed to our policyholders  and other income  which primarily represents commission income we earn on business written in texas 
our expenses consist predominately of the following page losses and loss adjustment expenses  including estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods  less the portion of those insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses that we ceded to our reinsurers  commissions and other underwriting expenses  which consist of commissions we pay to agents and brokers  premium taxes and company expenses related to the production and underwriting of insurance policies  less ceding commissions that we receive under our reinsurance contracts  other operating and general expenses  which include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and other expenses  and interest expense on debt 
operating results key states the market conditions in the states in which we operate are competitive to varying degrees 
some companies with which we compete  primarily in california  do not verify certain underwriting information or default to lower values  which has the effect of lowering the premium they charge  and thus attract more business 
in addition  some companies with which we compete pay incentives to agents and brokers 
also  some competitors spend significant sums on advertising 
we have not relaxed our underwriting standards  do not advertise  and do not pay incentive commissions 
we monitor the rate and underwriting activity of the other market participants in each state in which we do business 
we have noted some indications that the competitive conditions in some states may be stabilizing 
during the fourth quarter of  we began noting some moderation in rate decreases and began to see an up tick in rate filings where companies are raising rates 
overall  we observed competitor rate revisions and new product introductions during the quarter ended december  these included rate increases  rate reductions  revenue neutral filings  and introductions of new products 
in the aggregate  our gross written premium decreased by in compared to included in these figures is a change in the provision for expected policy cancellations that increased gross written premium by for the year ended december  and by for the year ended the purpose of the provision is to reduce installment premiums due in the future from policyholders as well as the related unearned premiums to the amount we expect to ultimately collect and earn 
changes in the provision are generally driven by observed changes in the cancellation rate of in force policies and changes in the balance of unearned premium 
there appear to be several reasons for the improvement in the cancellation rate 
a greater proportion of our business is renewal business  which has better payment performance than new business 
in addition  our stepped up retention efforts are positively affecting both the persistency of our business and our collection of past due balances 
the decrease in the provision added million and million to gross written premium during and  respectively  and a similar amount to reported unearned premiums and premiums receivable 
the decrease has no effect on earned premium  and therefore  no direct effect upon reported net income 
gross written premium before and after the change in the provision for cancellations for the three years ended december   and is set forth below

for the year ended december   the average number of policies in force decreased to  from  for the comparable period of  while our gross earned premium declined over the same period 
the table below shows our average number of policies in force and gross earned premium for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period of twelve months ended december  change in thousands average number of policies in force gross earned premium one aspect of our growth strategy is to increase the number of producers with which we do business 
we attempt to target producers in geographic areas where we are under represented and where we believe we can write profitable business 
during  we increased our total number of producers to approximately  and our total number of producer locations to more than  over time  it is our goal to increase our geographic diversification 
california continues to be our largest state  and california  florida and michigan accounted for of our volume for however  our mix of premium writings has become more geographically diverse as we derived of our gross written premium from california in  down from in year to year changes in gross written premium  as enumerated above  vary significantly by state and are dependent upon a variety of factors  including competitive conditions and regulatory environments within those states  our strategies with respect to product pricing and the number and location of producers 
in california  our premium writings declined by in and by in  as we observed intensifying competitive conditions in that state 
in our other states  in the aggregate  our premium writings grew by in and by in in california  competitors filed rates remain stable  however  many have relaxed underwriting standards by not verifying mileage bands and other underwriting information  such as driving experience 
this behavior results in lower policy premium for some consumers  making it more difficult for companies not engaging page in such practices to attract and retain customers 
we have not relaxed our underwriting standards and do not intend to do so in the future 
we have increased the number of producers in california to  with  locations as of december  from producers with  locations at december  our strategy remains to increase the number of producers  without over saturating the market 
we closely monitor the behavior of our new producers to ensure adherence to our underwriting standards 
new business application volume in california during the fourth quarter of was approximately lower than the comparable quarter of this change gives us some indication that the market may be beginning to stabilize  as the rate of decline we experienced throughout the first three quarters of had been closer to 
in the latter part of  we also noted improvement in our business retention  which offset some of the decline in our new business  resulting in our overall gross written premium declining by less than the decline in new business policies 
the table below shows our gross written premium by state and quarter for the twelve months ended december  three months ended twelve months ended state march  june  september  december  december  dollars in millions california florida michigan texas south carolina pennsylvania new hampshire maine virginia georgia all other includes states gross written premium  before change in expected policy cancellation provision change in expected policy cancellation provision gross written premium in florida  our second largest state  gross written premium declined by for the year ended december  compared to although we experienced a decline in our year to year premium volume  we observed improvement in this market  especially in the last quarter of  during which we tracked rate increases  two rate decreases  and six revenue neutral rate filings by companies with which we compete 
we raised our rates by about in this market on december   and some of the companies with which we compete raised their rates during the latter part of we continue to increase our producer representation in florida with  producers and  locations as of december   up from  producers with  locations as of december  we continue to experience strong growth in michigan where our premium volume increased for the year ended december  compared to our strategy in michigan is to grow by increasing the number of producers in profitable geographic areas where we are under represented 
at december   we had producers with locations  up from producers with locations at december  over time  we have built strong producer relationships based on the competitiveness of our products and customer service 
due to the recent market entrants and rate filing activity  we believe conditions will become more competitive in the future 
the governor of michigan recently proposed legislation that would decrease automobile insurance rates by  eliminate the use of credit as a rating variable  and seek changes in the law to make it easier for claimants to file tort claims 
we are closely monitoring this situation 
texas is our fourth largest state  and we experienced a very strong growth rate of in our premium volume for the year ended december  compared to our producer representation in texas grew to producers with  locations as of december   up from producers with locations as of december   increases of and  respectively 
during the last quarter of  we observed increasingly competitive market conditions in texas  as we noted that filed rate decreases by companies with which we compete outnumbered rate increases 
these rate decreases caused our competitive position to erode during the fourth quarter page of  during which we experienced a decline in our premium volume compared to the same period of as with each state in which we do business  we are closely monitoring and analyzing our business in texas 
operations we closely monitor staffing levels in relation to volume in our claims and policy service divisions 
we also utilize various metrics to track service performance to ensure that service levels are meeting or exceeding our benchmarks 
we continue to stress productivity as staff count had decreased by to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this compares to a decline in our gross earned premium for the year 
we modified rates times during the year ended december  six such modifications were for rate increases  were decreases  and were revenue neutral 
in  we decreased our overall rate level by 
we continuously monitor our rate levels and will continue to seek rate changes in states where warranted 
in addition  we believe we can continue to improve our product structure by filing class plan changes that  through segmentation  we design to attract certain market segments that we have observed to produce favorable results relative to the overall market in a given state 
in the aggregate  we have now deployed point of sale underwriting in states  and we utilized point of sale underwriting on of new business applications in the fourth quarter of we have fully deployed onestep in south carolina  california  and ohio for both new business and endorsements 
additionally  we are in the process of deploying onestep in texas 
we have deployed onestep raptor in all but three of our other states 
we have an exclusive license to use onestep in the non standard automobile insurance industry through december onestep and onestep raptor use technology to provide fast and accurate quotes by accessing third party information at the point of sale  including an applicant s driving record  accident history and  where permitted by law  credit reports 
this process reduces the frequency of uprates which may occur when an application is incomplete or inaccurate 
our point of sale application systems permit the producer to print the policy  the identification cards and the policy declaration page as soon as the verifications are complete  usually within minutes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts we report in our financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions are subject to change and  if changed  would impact amounts we report in the future 
we have identified accounting policies involving estimates that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of these policies 
estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our actuarial staff reviews our insurance subsidiaries loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
when estimating our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of our insurance policies  we rely heavily on our historical loss and loss adjustment expense experience 
we periodically adjust our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for changes in product mix  underwriting standards and rules  loss cost trends and other factors 
we also incorporate into our analyses factors such as the rate of inflation  claims settlement patterns and legislative activities and litigation trends that may impact our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
as our experience develops or we learn additional information  we increase or decrease our loss and loss adjustment expense reserve levels  as necessary 
these changes to our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are reflected in our results of operations in the period in which our estimates change 
ultimately  our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
at each financial reporting date  we record our best estimate  which is a point estimate  of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  gross and net of reinsurance 
in selecting the best estimate  we utilize up to different actuarial methodologies 
each of these methodologies is designed to forecast the number of claims we will be called upon to pay and the amounts we will pay on average to settle those claims 
in arriving at our best estimate  our actuaries consider the likely predictive value of the various loss development methodologies employed in light of underwriting practices  premium rate changes and claim settlement practices that may have occurred  and weight the credibility of each methodology 
our actuarial methodologies take into account various factors  including  but not limited to  paid losses  liability estimates for reported losses  paid allocated loss adjustment expenses  salvage and other recoveries received  reported claim counts  open claim counts and counts for claims closed with and without payment of loss 
page in establishing our best estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  we determine the number of claims that have been reported as of the financial reporting date and make an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us as of that date 
because our evaluations are based upon historical patterns  if the rate of claims reported to us or paid by us differs from our historical patterns  our evaluations may underestimate the number of claims that will ultimately be paid  and therefore  the amount of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded for the period 
for the year ended december   we experienced an insignificant amount of adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to prior years compared to million of adverse development during the year ended december  if our estimate of gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million at december  decreases or increases in by one percent  our net income or loss for would decrease or increase by million after tax assuming an effective tax rate of 
if the increase were to be wholly or partly caused by gross losses ceded to the mcca state reinsurance facility  the impact on net income would be reduced because the covered portion of the loss would be ceded to the mcca 
accruals for litigation 
we continually evaluate potential liabilities and reserves for litigation using the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals 
legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss 
legal personnel then review these matters to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if we should record or adjust a provision for loss  the amount that we should record  and any appropriate disclosure regarding the provision  and communicate such information to accounting personnel 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations we use to estimate our potential liability for litigation are appropriate 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of these claims or lawsuits  we believe we have adequately reserved for our existing known litigation and that such litigation will not have a material effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these claims or lawsuits  as well as the tax deductibility of related payments  it is possible that the ultimate cost to us of these claims or lawsuits could exceed the reserves we establish by amounts that would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations in a particular quarter or year 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  we are required to review the contractual terms of all our reinsurance purchases to ensure compliance with that statement 
the statement establishes the conditions required for a contract with a reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance and prescribes accounting and reporting standards for those contracts 
contracts that do not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the insurance risk assumed generally do not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and must be accounted for as deposits 
sfas no 
also requires us to disclose the nature  purpose and effect of reinsurance transactions  including the premium amounts associated with reinsurance assumed and ceded 
it also requires disclosure of concentrations of credit risk associated with reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums

gross written premium 
gross written premium decreased to million for the twelve months ended december   or by  compared to million for the decline in gross written premium emanated primarily from california where written premium declined by for the year 
generally  we observed increasingly competitive conditions during in the states where we do business 
as we have exercised underwriting and pricing discipline  we have seen our volume of business decline in several states  most notably  california and florida  and grow more slowly in many other states compared to we provide for expected policy cancellations in order to adjust written premium to amounts we expect to ultimately collect and earn see operating results key states above 
during  we reduced the provision by million  which added to our reported gross written premium for the year 
net written premium 
net written premium increased by to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable period of of the increase in net written premium  million was due to the reduction in the cession percentage to for business from for business and million is due to the termination and commutation of our quota share reinsurance agreement effective january  as of january  all of the material reinsurance agreements to which we had been a party had been terminated and commuted  and the reinsurers had been released from all future liabilities under the agreements

net investment income and realized losses and gains on investments 
net investment income was million for the twelve months ended compared to million for the same period of most of the increase was attributable to a larger invested asset base on average during compared to our initial public offering  which we completed in february  provided million of net proceeds and the termination and commutation of our quota share reinsurance agreement resulted in our receipt of million in january excluding the proceeds from the reinsurance termination  cash flow from operations aggregated million for the twelve months page ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increased cash flow also contributed to the growth in invested assets and increased net investment income

policy service fee revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million  equivalent to of gross earned premium  compared to million  equivalent to of gross earned premium  for the same period of the most prominent factor affecting our level of fee income is the decline in our average policies in force 
as noted above  the ratio of fees to gross earned premium has declined by point  indicating that on a per policy basis  we are collecting lower fees on average than in the prior year 
approximately  or points  of the decline is due to a lesser proportion of our business emanating from california where the level of fees charged is greater related to premiums than in the other states in which we operate 
while approximately of new business has been written on electronic funds transfer eft payment plans in recent months  and we charge approximately lower installment fees on installments paid by eft  this has not been a significant factor in the lower fee ratio for the full year  accounting for less than  or points  of the decline

the disclosure requirements  including quantitative and qualitative information regarding investments in an unrealized loss position  remain effective and are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb released fasb staff position nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which effectively replaces eitf issue no 
fsp contains a three step model for evaluating impairments and carries forward the disclosure requirements in eitf issue no 
pertaining to securities in an unrealized loss position is considered impaired  an evaluation is made to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary  and  if an impairment is considered other than temporary  a realized loss is recognized to write the security s cost or amortized cost basis down to fair value 
fsp references existing other than temporary impairment guidance for determining when an impairment is other than temporary and clarifies that  subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment loss for debt securities  an investor shall account for the security using the constant effective yield method 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
we adopted fsp upon issuance  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
this statement provides guidance to insurance entities that incur deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines internal replacements as modifications in product benefits  features  rights  or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement  or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage with a contract 
the accounting treatment for such replacements depends on whether  under the provisions of the sop  the replacement contract is considered substantially changed from the replaced contract 
a substantial change would be treated as the extinguishment of the replaced contract  and all unamortized deferred acquisition costs  unearned revenue liabilities  and deferred sales inducement assets from the replaced contract would no longer be deferred in connection with the replacement contract 
a replacement contract that is substantially unchanged should be accounted for as a continuation of the original contract 
sop will be effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we plan to adopt this statement beginning with the fiscal quarter beginning january  we do not expect that adoption of this sop will have a material impact on our net income in contractual obligations and commitments the following table displays our contractual obligations by the years in which payments are due as of december  page or later total in millions long term debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves total contractual obligations includes principal repayments only

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
inflation affects interest rates and claim costs 
we also consider the effects of inflation in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
we cannot accurately determine the actual effects of inflation on our results 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to a persisting long term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we endeavor to take inflation into account in our pricing and in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to two types of market risk interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk investments 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of debt securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to our debt securities portfolio is interest rate risk  which we strive to limit by managing duration to a defined range of three to four years and laddering or utilizing an even distribution in the maturities of the securities we purchase to achieve our duration target 
interest rate risk includes the risk from movements in the underlying market rate and in the credit spread of the respective sectors of the debt securities in our portfolio 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is page also true 
we expect to manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  was years 
should market interest rates increase  our fixed income portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by million  or 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would result in approximately million  or  appreciation in the market value of our fixed income portfolio 
credit facility 
we also have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates because we have variable rate debt 
the interest rate we pay increases or decreases with the changes in libor 
based on our borrowings under the floating rate credit agreement at december   a increase in market interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by approximately  conversely  a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our annual net interest expense by approximately  credit risk investments 
our securities are exposed to credit risk 
we attempt to manage our credit risk through issuer and industry diversification 
we regularly monitor our overall investment results and review compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of debt securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in debt securities of a single issuer 
all of the debt securities in our portfolio were rated investment grade by the national association of insurance commissioners  or the naic  and standard poor s as of december  reinsurance 
we are no longer subject to material credit risks with respect to balances due from our reinsurers 
as of january  all of the material reinsurance agreements to which we had been a party had been terminated and commuted and the reinsurers had been released from all future liabilities under the agreements
