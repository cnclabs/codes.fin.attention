critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the listing below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to stock based compensation  tax valuation allowance and asset impairments to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
equity based compensation the company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense related to employee stock options is recorded if  on the date of grant  the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
the company adopted the disclosure only requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
for transactions with employees and provide pro forma operating results and pro forma per share disclosures for employee stock grants as if the fair value based method of accounting in sfas no 
as amended by sfas has been applied to these transactions 
options issued to non employees are valued using the fair value methodology under sfas on june   the company accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than  the closing price was on june  unvested options to purchase approximately thousand shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
typically  the company grants stock options that vest over a four year period 
the purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable the company to avoid recognizing  in its consolidated statement of operations  compensation expense associated with these options in future periods  upon adoption of sfas r share based payment in january the impact of this acceleration resulted in a million increase in proforma stock based compensation expense in the company adopted the disclosure only requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
if the company had adopted sfas to recognize an expense for options granted to employees and directors under our stock based compensation plans  our earnings would have been materially impacted 
the impact of this method is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
options issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the option based on the value of the award using the black scholes method 
compensation cost is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with eitf issue no 
and is recognized over the service period 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb no 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be allowed to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense in the statements of operations 
the adoption of sfas r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects of share based payment arrangements and additional disclosure of their cash flow impacts 
sfas r also allows  but does not require  companies to restate prior periods 
the company expects to adopt the provisions of sfas r  prospectively  beginning january   the expected effect of the implementation of sfas r is expected to be in the range of to million for the full year on september   the board of directors approved the retention award agreements and pharmos entered into retention award agreements with each of dr 
haim aviv  chairman and chief executive officer  and dr 
gad riesenfeld  its then president and chief operating officer 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock units to dr 
aviv 
the company granted retention awards consisting of cash and restricted stock to dr 
riesenfeld the awards 
under the agreement  one half of the awards vested on december  and the balance shall vest and become non forfeitable on june   subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions 
under the terms of dr 
riesenfeld s severance agreement  the balance of his awards will vest on his departure from the company on april  and the expense of those awards is being accelerated through april  the fair value of the restricted shares was based on the fair value of the stock on the issuance date 
the aggregate fair value of the restricted stock awards totaled million 
for financial reporting purposes  the cash awards and the fair value of the restricted stock awards  which totaled  will be expensed pro rata over the vesting periods 
per the awards  only dr 
riesenfeld was issued the restricted stock  dr 
aviv received restricted stock units 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in the reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would increase our net loss in the period in which the charge arose 
tax valuation allowance the company has assessed the likelihood of realizing future taxable income and has determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made

uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists
