acquisitions and comparability of operations our results of operations for the fiscal years ended  and include the results of several acquisitions including go toast in december  netconversions in february  mediabrokers  technologybrokers and sbi 
razorfish in july  and dna in december the results of these acquisitions should be factored into any comparison of our and results to the results for effective january   avenue a razorfish s clients are directly liable for the cost of media purchases pursuant to our contractual agreements with those clients 
as a result  we began recording revenue generated under those contractual agreements on a net basis  which excludes the cost of media purchased for our clients 
this should be factored into comparisons of our and results to the results for digital marketing services avenue a razorfish is an interactive advertising agency that helps our clients use the internet as an integrated online business channel 
we provide digital marketing services including customer focused websites and enterprise websites referred to as our web development business and interactive marketing referred to as our web media business 
during  avenue a razorfish experienced significant growth in both its web development and web media businesses 
growth in the web development market during led to an increase in both new clients and larger projects from existing clients 
the growth of the web development business during was driven by the acquisition of sbi 
razorfish in july and by market growth 
our web media business also experienced growth during mostly due to increased spending by our existing clients 
in december  avenue a razorfish acquired uk based dna  an interactive advertising agency 
this acquisition provides avenue a razorfish with a presence within the european market 
the digital marketing services line of business experienced improved profit margins in over the prior year  mostly due to the performance of the web development business 
increased profitability of the web development business was mainly achieved through the rapid growth of the business  an increase in average billing rates and operating efficiencies gained due to the continued integration of sbi 
razorfish with avenue a 
in  we expect the avenue a razorfish business to continue to grow by increasing our client base and increased spending by existing clients 
the majority of this growth is expected to be organic rather than through acquisitions 
additionally  by integrating our web development business and our web media business  we expect to generate increased cross selling opportunities 
we expect our client support and sales and marketing expenses to increase in line with the growth in revenue and  as a result  profit margins for the full year are expected to be similar to those achieved during the three months ended december  we believe international markets represent long term growth opportunities for us  and therefore  intend to make additional investments to support international growth into european and asian markets 
digital marketing technologies our atlas business offers digital marketing technology solutions for advertising agencies  enterprise marketers large companies who manage their own marketing programs and publishers 
we provide agencies and enterprise marketers with online advertising campaign management  rich media  search  and website optimization tools and services via our proprietary atlas digital marketing suite 
we also provide a technology product that enables select publishers to increase revenue by utilizing lower value and remnant inventory through atlas publisher 

table of contents our atlas business grew substantially during with increased usage of our atlas digital marketing suite by both new and existing customers 
an increase in ad serving volume during the year accounts for the majority of increased revenue for the digital marketing technologies segment 
in  we launched the first version of atlas rich media  a full featured set of rich media technologies and services that allows users to deliver expanding  floating  video and custom ads throughout the internet  fully integrating it into the atlas digital marketing suite 
as a result of the product launch  we expect to generate increased revenues from rich media in profit margins increased during due to the overall growth of the business and the relatively low incremental cost of providing atlas services to new clients 
this was partially offset by atlas investing heavily in product development including enhancements of the atlas digital marketing suite and the development of atlas on demand  a tool that is designed to allow advertising agencies and large direct advertisers to deliver effective marketing campaigns for on demand cable applications 
as a result  product development headcount increased during the second half of in order to support the growth of the business  resulting in increased product development expenses 
we also made increased investments in our technology infrastructure during  including the build out of a new data center 
in  we expect the growth of the atlas business to continue but at a slower rate than in investments in product development are expected to increase and to be focused mainly on the continued development of atlas publisher  atlas rich media and additional components of the atlas digital marketing suite 
we also expect continued development of atlas on demand  however  we do not expect to generate meaningful revenue for atlas on demand until at least additionally  we intend to increase investments in our technology infrastructure to meet the expected growth of the digital marketing technologies segment 
digital performance media digital performance media includes drivepm and mediabrokers 
drivepm was developed internally in and we purchased mediabrokers in july drivepm and mediabrokers are online advertising networks that serve as intermediaries between online publishers and advertisers by procuring online advertising inventory primarily from publishers and reselling that inventory to advertisers on a highly targeted basis 
the client base and number of publisher partnerships in our digital performance media line of business grew during  contributing to significant growth in both revenue and income from operations 
sales efforts increased during the second half of with the growth of the drivepm and mediabrokers sales teams 
client support expenses also increased during as additional headcount was added to support the growth of the business 
in  we anticipate continued strong growth in the digital performance media line of business 
a significant component of this growth is expected to be from new clients generated by a larger sales force 
additionally  improvements in the technology used by both drivepm and mediabrokers is expected to increase revenue opportunities and bring operational efficiencies so that the incremental cost of servicing new clients decreases over time 
as a result  we expect income from operations as a percentage of revenue to increase for critical accounting policies and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions 
table of contents are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition for fixed price contracts avenue a razorfish follows statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and recognizes revenue from fixed fee consulting contracts as services are rendered using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete measured using labor hours 
cost estimates on percentage of completion contracts are reviewed periodically with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
billings on uncompleted contracts may be less than or greater than the revenues recognized and are recorded as either unbilled receivable an asset or deferred revenue a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
accounting for acquisitions significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition  including estimating future cash flows from the acquired business  determining appropriate discount rates  asset lives and other assumptions 
our process to determine the fair value of the non compete agreements  customer relationships  developed technology and consulting service model includes the use of estimates including the potential impact on operating results if the non compete agreements were not in place  revenue estimates for customers acquired through the acquisition based on an assumed customer attrition rate  estimated costs willing to be incurred to purchase the capabilities gained through the developed technology and consulting service model  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of an entity s growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of our routine long range planning process 
accounting for goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist at the reporting unit level  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
a reporting unit level is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
this determination requires significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting units revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and a variety of external sources 
in addition to being used in our goodwill impairment analysis  the same estimates are used for both our long term and short term business planning and forecasting 
we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis by comparison to available and comparable market data 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment of each reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our most recent review  which did not result in the recording of an impairment charge 
we will perform our next annual review during the fourth 
table of contents quarter of we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if a reporting unit fails to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed operating margin results 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
we perform periodic evaluations of recorded tax assets and liabilities and maintains a valuation allowance if deemed necessary 
the determination of taxes payable for the current year includes estimates 
in the event that actual results differ materially from management s expectations  the estimated taxes payable could materially change  directly impacting the company s financial position or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions related to financial statements the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those affecting revenues  the allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for sales credits  intangible assets  goodwill  state  local and federal income taxes and general business contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
washington state tax authorities issued a ruling in that permits us to exclude amounts paid by us to purchase media for clients that is ultimately billed to and paid for by clients  from the measure of washington state business and occupation tax 
we received reporting instructions from washington state tax authorities that disallows this exclusion after periods beginning in february we have since implemented tax planning strategies that are intended to mitigate any potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from this change

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
a conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire assets where the timing and or method of settlement are conditioned on future events 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we adopted the provisions of fin in the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in an entity s statement of income 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the quarter ending march  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts  for the years ended december   and  as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
we have completed a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting sfas r and estimate that it will result in share based payment expense between million and million for the year ending december  the actual effects of adopting sfas r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  actual option grant activity during the year ending december   the market value of our common stock on the date future options are granted  and the assumed award forfeiture rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term  investment grade debt securities issued by corporations and us government agencies 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we maintain bank accounts with balances denominated in british pounds to support our uk based operations 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on these accounts  although we do not believe this exposure is material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk  to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or for speculative trading purposes
