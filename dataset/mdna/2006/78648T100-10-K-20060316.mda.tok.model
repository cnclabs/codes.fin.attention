commonwealth automobile reinsurers 
in order to protect insurers from the assignment of erps and certain other insurance regulatory conditions  the massachusetts legislature created car  which runs a reinsurance pool 
car is governed by a committee that is appointed by the commissioner  but its rules and decisions are subject to the review and approval of the commissioner 
under car s current rules  companies may cede to the reinsurance pool policies that they determine are not likely to be profitable 
as a result  car operates at an underwriting deficit 
this deficit is allocated among every automobile insurance company based on a complex formula that takes into consideration a company s voluntary market share  the amount of business it cedes to car and credits the company earns under a system car has designed to encourage carriers to voluntarily write business in selected under priced classes and territories 
we have developed underwriting and actuarial analysis systems to evaluate the profitability of ceding a risk to car or writing it voluntarily 
proposed reform of car 
on december   the commissioner approved new rules for car  which became effective on january  the approved rules 
pursuant to the approved rules  car s current system of assigning erps to each insurer and providing reinsurance to insurers is to be replaced by the massachusetts assigned insurance plan the maip 
the maip is a type of assigned risk plan similar to that used to manage the automobile insurance residual market in most other states 
on january   we filed  on form k  an estimate of the financial impact the approved rules may have on us and we stated that a lawsuit had been filed in suffolk superior court by commerce insurance company against the commissioner that seeks an order permanently enjoining implementation and or enforcement of the approved rules 
on june   the massachusetts superior court ruled that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to implement the approved rules and ordered them vacated 
as a result  the approved rules did not go into effect 
the commissioner appealed the decision of the massachusetts superior court 
on october   the massachusetts supreme judicial court agreed to take on direct appellate review of the commissioner s appeal 
at the present time  we are unable to predict whether the commissioner s appeal will be successful 
the approved rules and other recent related developments are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive summary and overview 
dominance of domestic companies 
many large national private passenger automobile insurance writers  such as state farm  allstate  progressive  berkshire hathaway geico  and farmers  write very little or no private passenger automobile insurance business in massachusetts 
we actively participate in major industry policy making organizations in massachusetts  such as the automobile insurers bureau and car  where our employees serve on a number of committees 
prominence of independent insurance agents 
finally  and perhaps most importantly to our company s success  approximately of the direct written premiums in the massachusetts automobile insurance market was placed by independent agents in  according to am best 
nationally  independent agents wrote only about of the automobile insurance market in  according to am best 
accordingly  to be successful  a company must have a strategy designed to encourage the best agents to place their best business with that company 
we have designed a system of agent commissions  profit sharing  bonuses and other strategies  such as our information technology capabilities  that we believe favorably distinguishes our company from our competitors 
we aggressively market our company to independent agents in attempting to get the best agents and the best business

distribution we distribute our products exclusively through independent agents  unlike some of our competitors  which use multiple distribution channels 
we believe this gives us a competitive advantage with the agents 
we have two types of independent agents those with which we have voluntarily entered into an agreement  which we refer to as voluntary agents  and those that car has assigned to us as erps 
with the exception of our erps  we do not accept business from insurance brokers 
our voluntary agents have authority pursuant to our voluntary agency agreement to bind our insurance subsidiaries for any coverage that is within the scope of their authority 
we reserve the ability under massachusetts law to cancel any coverage  other than private passenger automobile insurance  within the first days after it is bound 
in total  our independent agents have offices some agencies have more than one office and approximately  customer service representatives 
voluntary agents 
in  we obtained approximately of our direct written premiums for automobile insurance and of our direct written premiums for all of our other lines of business through our voluntary agents 
as of february   we had agreements with voluntary agents 
our voluntary agents are located in all regions of massachusetts 
we look for agents with profitable portfolios of business 
to become a voluntary agent for our company  we generally require that an agency i have been in business for at least five years  ii have exhibited a three year average ratio of losses  excluding loss adjustment expenses  to net earned premiums pure loss ratio of or less on the portion of the agent s portfolio that we would underwrite  iii currently write policies for a minimum of two automobile carriers  iv make a commitment for us to underwrite at least policies from the agency during the first twelve months after entering an agreement with us  and v offer multiple product lines 
every year  we review the performance of our agents during the prior year 
if an agent fails to meet our profitability standards  we try to work with the agent to improve the profitability of the business it places with us 
we generally terminate contracts each year with a few agencies  which  despite our efforts  have been consistently unable to meet our standards 
although independent agents usually represent several unrelated insurers  our goal is to be one of the top two insurance companies represented in each of our agencies  as measured by premiums 
no individual agency generated more than of our direct written premiums in exclusive representative producers 
in  our erps generated approximately of our direct written premiums for automobile insurance 
as of december   we had private passenger automobile erps 
car defines erps as licensed dwelling fire or casualty insurance agents or brokers who have a place of business in massachusetts  but have no existing voluntary independent agency relationship with an automobile insurer conducting business in massachusetts 
an erp s policy portfolio typically includes a significant percentage of what are considered to be under priced automobile policies 
massachusetts law guarantees that car provide motor vehicle insurance coverage to all qualified applicants 
to facilitate this system  under car s current rules  any qualified licensed insurance producer that is unable to obtain a voluntary automobile relationship with an insurer becomes an erp and is assigned to an insurer  which is then required to write that agent s policies 
the number of mandated erp policies assigned to a massachusetts insurance carrier is intended to be proportionate to its voluntary market share 
however  because no insurer can control the relative volumes of voluntary and erp business with certainty  carriers are usually either relatively oversubscribed or undersubscribed with erp policies 
periodically  car assigns or re assigns an erp to the most undersubscribed insurer 
according to the february  car private passenger subscription report  as of december   our erp policies totaled  or approximately of our market share percentage of erp policies  making us the second most undersubscribed carrier as of that date 
e 
marketing we view the independent agent as our customer and business partner 
as a result  our marketing efforts focus on developing interdependent relationships with leading massachusetts agents that write profitable business and positioning ourselves as the preferred insurance carrier of those agents  thereby receiving a larger portion of each agent s aggregate business 
we do not market ourselves to potential policyholders 
our principal marketing strategies are to offer a range of products  which we believe enables our agents to meet the insurance needs of their clients  and overcomes agents resistance to placing their clients automobile insurance and other coverages with different insurers  to price our products competitively  including offering discounts when and where appropriate for safer drivers and for affinity groups  and also offering account discounts for policyholders that have both an automobile and homeowners policy with us  to offer agents competitive commissions  with incentives for placing their more profitable business with us  and to provide a level of support and service that enhances the agent s ability to do business with its clients and with us 
commission schedule and profit sharing plan 
we have several programs designed to attract profitable new private passenger automobile business from agents by paying them more than the minimum commission the law requires which is of premiums for  and in 
we recognize our top performing agents by making them members of our president s club or executive club 
in  president s club members receive a commission equal to of premiums for each new policy with a safe driver credit code of and drivers with no accidents or violations in the prior six and five years respectively  while executive club members receive a commission equal to of premiums for such policies 
in  of our drivers were in safe driver insurance plan steps or similar to credit code and  as compared to for the massachusetts private passenger automobile industry as a whole  based on the number of drivers per month in each step according to car 
further  we have a competitive agency incentive commission program under which we pay agents up to of premiums based on the loss ratio on their business 
we have received no inquiries from the commissioner  the massachusetts attorney general  or any other government agency relative to how we conduct our contingent commissions and profit sharing programs 
service and support 
we believe that the level and quality of service and support we provide helps differentiate us from other insurers 
we have made a significant investment in information technology designed to facilitate our agents business 
our avc website helps agents manage their work efficiently 
we provide a substantial amount of information online that agents need to serve their customers  such as information about the status of new policies  bill payments and claims 
providing this type of content reduces the number of customer calls we receive and empowers the agent s customer service representatives by enabling them to respond to customers inquiries while the customer is on the telephone 
finally  we believe that the knowledge and experience of our employees enhance the quality of support we provide 
f 
underwriting our underwriting department is responsible for a number of key decisions affecting the profitability of our business  including pricing of discounts offered on our private passenger automobile product  pricing of our commercial automobile  homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella  business owners policies  commercial umbrella and commercial package products  determining which policies to cede to car s reinsurance pool and which to retain  and evaluating whether to accept transfers of a portion of an existing or potential new agent s portfolio from another insurer 
we are organized into three underwriting units  a separate unit for massachusetts private passenger automobile  a separate unit for all other personal lines underwriting including homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella and inland marine coverages  and a separate unit for commercial lines  including commercial auto  business owners policies  commercial umbrella and commercial package policies 
pricing 
our pricing strategy for private passenger automobile insurance primarily depends on the maximum permitted premium rates and minimum permitted commission levels mandated by the commissioner 
for several years prior to  we offered discounts off the state mandated rates to drivers in the lower safe driver insurance plan steps  as did a number of other insurers 
however  starting in  we began to reduce the discounts we offered  in light of the reductions or minimal increases in average rates the commissioner has mandated in each year since we currently do not offer any safe driver insurance plan credit code based discounts 
primarily as a result of reducing discounts and the purchasing of new cars by our insureds for which we are permitted to charge higher premiums  our average premium received per policy increased in  in and in in addition to safe driver insurance plan discounts  we also offer group discounts to members of affinity groups  including the boston college alumni association  the massachusetts bar association and the massachusetts medical society 
in general  we target affinity groups with a mature and stable membership base along with favorable driving records  offering between a and discount with being the average discount offered 
approximately of the private passenger policies we issue receive an affinity group discount 
car and the commissioner set the premium rates for commercial automobile policies reinsured through car 
subject to commissioner review  we set rates for commercial automobile policies that are not reinsured through car  and for all other insurance lines we offer  including homeowners  dwelling fire  personal umbrella  commercial umbrella  commercial package policies and business owner policies 
we base our rates on industry loss cost data  our own loss experience  catastrophe modeling and prices charged by our competitors in the massachusetts market 
we received approval for a rate increase of for our commercial automobile line effective december   and also received approval for a rate increase of for our homeowners line effective june  cede retain decisions 
under car s current rules  we must decide  within days after the effective date of a new policy or before renewing an existing policy  whether to cede it to car s reinsurance pool 
each massachusetts automobile insurer must bear a portion of the losses of the reinsurance pool 
under car s current rules  we are able to reduce our total allocated share of the losses of the reinsurance pool by ceding less business to the pool than our proportionate share 
as a result  in determining whether to cede an under priced policy to car s private passenger automobile reinsurance pool  we attempt to evaluate whether we are likely to incur greater total losses by ceding it to the pool or by retaining it 
according to the february  car cession volume analysis private passenger report  as of december   we have ceded of our private passenger automobile business to the pool in  compared to an average of for the industry 
our goal is to cede only those policies that incur less total losses resulting from a cession to car  than the total losses incurred by retaining the policy 
car also runs a reinsurance pool for commercial automobile policies 
we analyze whether to cede or retain our business in that line in a similar fashion 
according to the january  car cession volume analysis all other than private passenger report  as of december   we have ceded of our commercial automobile business to the pool in  compared to an average of for the industry 
bulk policy transfers and new voluntary agents 
from time to time  we receive proposals from existing voluntary agents to transfer a portfolio of the agent s business from another insurer to us 
our underwriters model the profitability of these portfolios before we accept these transfers 
among other things  we usually require that the portfolio have a pure loss ratio of or less on the portion of the agent s portfolio that we would underwrite 
in addition  we require any new voluntary agent to commit to transfer a portfolio to us consisting of at least policies 
policy processing and rate pursuit 
our underwriting department assists in processing policy applications  endorsements  renewals and cancellations 
in the past three years  we have introduced new proprietary software that enables agents to connect to our network and enter policy and endorsement applications for private passenger automobile insurance from their office computers 
in our private passenger automobile insurance line  our agents now submit approximately of all applications for new policies or endorsements for existing policies through our proprietary information portal  the avc 
our rate pursuit team aggressively monitors all insurance transactions to make sure we receive the correct premium for the risk insured 
we accomplish this by verifying massachusetts pricing criteria  such as proper classification of drivers  the make  model and age of insured vehicles and the availability of discounts 
we verify that operators are properly listed and classified  assignment of operators to vehicles  vehicle garaging  vehicle pre inspection requirements and in some cases the validity of discounts 
in our homeowners and dwelling fire lines  our team has completed a project to update the replacement costs for each dwelling 
we use third party software to assist in these appraisal efforts 
g 
technology the focuses of our information technology effort are to constantly reengineer internal processes to allow more efficient operations  resulting in lower operating costs  to make it easier for independent agents to transact business with us  and to enable agents to efficiently provide their clients with a high level of service 
we believe that our technology initiatives have increased revenue and decreased cost 
for example  these initiatives have allowed us to reduce the number of call center transactions which we perform  and to transfer many manual processing functions from our internal operations to our independent agents 
we also believe that these initiatives have contributed to our overall increases in productivity 
in  we had employees and  in direct written premiums 
as of december   we had employees and  in direct written premiums  which represents an increase from direct written premiums per employee in to  direct written premiums per employee in internal applications intranet 
our employees access our proprietary applications through our corporate intranet 
our intranet applications streamline internal processes and improve overall operational efficiencies in areas including claims 
our claims workload management application allows our claims and subrogation adjusters to better manage injury claims 
subrogation refers to the process by which we are reimbursed by other insurers for claims costs we incur due to the fault of their insureds 
the use of this application has reduced the time it takes for us to respond to and settle casualty claims  which we believe helps reduce the total amount of our claims expense 
the automated adjuster assignment system categorizes our new claims by severity and assigns them to the appropriate adjuster responsible for investigation 
once assigned  the integrated workload management tools facilitate the work of promptly assigning appraisers  investigating liability  issuing checks and receiving subrogation receipts 
billing 
proprietary billing systems  integrated with the systems of our print and lock box vendors  expedite the processing and collection of premium receipts and finance charges from agents and policyholders 
we believe the sophistication of our direct bill system helps us to limit our bad debt expense 
in both and our bad debt expense as a percentage of direct written premiums was less than 
external applications 
agency employees can securely access business critical applications through our corporate extranet  which we call avc 
avc includes web enabled applications  advanced security and an internet enabled communications network  which we believe constitutes many of our agents only high speed internet connection 
we believe that avc is unique to the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance industry because using avc allows an agent to access a variety of vendors and other carriers over the internet through a single portal 
we currently have a patent application pending on avc 
the patent application pertains to the method and system by which avc delivers customer services to independent insurance agents 
the capability for agency personnel to schedule online appointments with third party vendors such as glass repair retailers and rental car agencies for their clients is also available 
we designed avc to be scalable so that these types of vendors and potentially  other insurers  can link to the network and create a once and done environment for the independent agent 
listed below are examples of the business critical applications agents may access through avc 
new business and endorsement processing 
agents can perform new business and endorsement processing with our point of sale application 
agents can upload policy data to our system directly from their agency system or rate quote software in avc s secure web environment without having to re enter policy information 
inquiry access 
inquiry access is a customer service application designed to provide agency customer service representatives with real time access to our database of insured information 
this application allows agents to view the status of claims  billing and policy detail 
policyholder inquiry 
policyholder inquiry provides hours a day  days a week self service account information to our policyholders through our website or through their independent agents websites 
this application provides policyholders with round the clock access to billing and claims information 
other tools and services avc gives agents access to electronic versions of underwriting manuals  which include updated guidelines for acceptable risks  commission levels and product pricing 
further  we have our agents using third party software the xnet cost estimator from marshall swift boeck that we make available through avc to help assess home replacement costs 
this initiative helps ensure that we receive the correct premium with respect to homeowners policies and provide the correct level of coverage against home loss 
finally  we provide agents a daily report of all their insurance transactions processed through avc 
this report allows our agents to monitor their performance and review profitability goals 
h 
claims because of the unique differences between the management of casualty claims and property claims  we use separate departments for each of these types of claims 
casualty claims we have a proven record of settling casualty claims below the industry average in massachusetts 
according to the automobile insurers bureau  our average casualty claim settlement during the period from january through september  was  approximately lower than the massachusetts industry average of  we have adopted stringent claims settlement procedures  which include guidelines that establish maximum settlement offers for soft tissue injuries  which constituted approximately of our bodily injury claims 
if we are unable to settle these claims within our guidelines  we generally take the claim to litigation 
we believe that these procedures result in providing our adjusters with a uniform approach to negotiation 
we believe an important component of handling claims efficiently is prompt investigation and settlement 
we find that faster claims settlements often result in less expensive claims settlements 
our e claim reporting system is an online product that reduces the time it takes for agents to notify our adjusters about claims  thereby enabling us to contact third party claimants and other witnesses quickly 
after business hours we outsource claims adjustment support to an independent firm whose employees contact third party claimants and other witnesses 
we believe that early notification results in our adjusters conducting prompt investigations of claims and compiling more accurate information about those claims 
our claims workload management software also assists our adjusters in handling claims quickly 
we believe the structure of our casualty claims unit allows us to respond quickly to claimants anywhere in the commonwealth of massachusetts 
comprising people  the department is organized into distinct claim units that contain loss costs for soft tissue injuries 
field adjusters are located geographically for prompt response to claims  with our litigation unit focused on managing loss costs and litigation expenses for serious injury claims 
additionally  we utilize a special unit to investigate fraud in connection with casualty claims 
this special unit has one manager and eight employees 
in cases where adjusters suspect fraud in connection with a claim  we deploy this special unit to conduct investigations 
we deny payment to claimants in cases in which we have succeeded in accumulating sufficient evidence of fraud 
property claims our property claims unit handles property claims arising in our private passenger and commercial automobile  homeowners and other insurance lines 
process automation has streamlined our property claims function 
many of our property claims are now handled by the agents through avc using our power desk software application 
as agents receive calls from claimants  power desk permits the agent to immediately send information related to the claim directly to us and to an independent appraiser selected by the agent to value the claim 
once we receive this information  an automated system redirects the claim to the appropriate internal adjuster responsible for investigating the claim to determine liability 
upon determination of liability  the system automatically begins the process of seeking a subrogation recovery from another insurer  if liable 
we believe this process results in a shorter time period from when the claimant first contacts the agent to when the claimant receives a claim payment  while enabling our agents to build credibility with their clients by responding to claims in a timely and efficient manner 
we benefit from decreased labor expenses from the need for fewer employees to handle the reduced property claims call volume 
another important factor in keeping our overall property claims costs low is collecting subrogation recoveries 
subrogation refers to the process by which we are reimbursed by other insurers for claims costs we incur due to the fault of their insureds 
we track the amounts we pay out in claims costs and identify cases in which we believe we can reclaim some or all of those costs through the use of our automated workload management tools 
i 
reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses associated with investigating and paying the losses  or loss adjustment expenses 
every quarter  we review our reserves internally 
regulations promulgated by the commissioner require us to annually obtain a certification from either a qualified actuary or an approved loss reserve specialist that our loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves are reasonable 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported 
incurred but not yet reported reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience 
we make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly to take into account changes in the volume of business written  claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses over time 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors 
after taking into account all relevant factors  management believes that our provision for net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
management calculates its loss and lae reserves estimates  independently from the company s actuaries 
the company s actuarial estimate for loss and lae reserves  net of the effect of ceded reinsurance  ranges from a low of  to a high of  as of december  the company s loss and lae reserves  based on management s best estimate  were set at  as of december  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than reserves carried at the balance sheet date 
establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized 
we do not discount any of our reserves 
the following table presents development information on changes in the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae of our insurance subsidiaries for the three years ended december  for the years ended december  reserves for losses and lae  beginning of year less reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and lae net reserves for losses and lae  beginning of year incurred losses and lae  related to current year prior years total incurred losses and lae paid losses and lae related to current year prior years total paid losses and lae net reserves for losses and lae  end of year plus reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae reserves for losses and lae  end of year at the end of each period  the reserves were re estimated for all prior accident years 
the company s prior year reserves decreased by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s prior year reserves increased by for the year ended december  the decrease in prior year reserves during resulted from re estimations of prior year ultimate loss and lae liabilities and is primarily composed of reductions of  in commonwealth automobile reinsurers car assumed reserves and  in the company s automobile reserves 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past experience 
the following table represents the development of reserves  net of reinsurance  for calendar years through the top line of the table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each successive year with respect to those claims 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year  including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year 
the estimate changes as more information becomes known about the payments  frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
favorable loss development  shown as a cumulative redundancy in the table  exists when the original reserve estimate is greater than the re estimated reserves at december  information with respect to the cumulative development of gross reserves that is  without deduction for reinsurance ceded also appears at the bottom portion of the table 
in evaluating the information in the table  it should be noted that each amount entered incorporates the effects of all changes in amounts entered for prior periods 
thus  if the estimate for a previously incurred loss was  and the loss was reserved at  in  the  deficiency later estimate minus original estimate would be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency in each of the years shown in the table 
it should further be noted that the table does not present accident or policy year development data 
in addition  conditions and trends that have affected the development of liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies from the table 
as of and for the year ended december  reserves for losses and lae originally estimated cumulative amounts paid as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later as of and for the year ended december  reserves re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency as of and for the year ended december  gross liability end of year reinsurance recoverables net liability end of year gross estimated liability latest reinsurance recoverables latest net estimated liability latest as the table shows  our net reserves grew at a faster rate than our gross reserves over the ten year period 
as we have grown  we have been able to retain a greater percentage of our direct business 
additionally  we used to conduct substantial business as a servicing carrier for other insurers  in which we would service the residual market automobile insurance business assigned to other carriers for a fee 
all business generated through this program was ceded to the other carriers 
as we reduced the amount of our servicing carrier business  our proportion of reinsurance ceded diminished 
the table also shows that we have substantially benefited in the current and prior years from releasing redundant reserves 
massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance pricing was very favorable in the early to mid s and the reserves we established for business written during that period developed favorably  allowing us to release substantial reserves in following years 
as maximum permitted rates declined in the latter part of the s through  and the redundancies resulting from favorable development of earlier years were released  our redundancies in subsequent years began to diminish 
in the year ended december  we increased loss reserves by in the year ended december  we released  in reserves related to prior years 
in the year ended december  we released  in reserves related to prior years as a result of our focus on core business lines since our founding in  we believe we have no exposure to asbestos or environmental pollution liabilities

reinsurance we reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten  thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses 
reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring ceding a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer reinsurer 
the reinsurer assumes a portion of the exposure in return for a share of the premium 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurance company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies  but it does make the reinsurer liable to the company for the reinsured portion of any loss realized 
we are selective in choosing our reinsurers  seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized 
in an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer  we continuously evaluate and review the financial condition of our reinsurers 
swiss re  our primary reinsurer  maintains an am best rating of a superior 
all of our other reinsures have an am best rating of a excellent or better except for endurance re  montpelier re and amlin bermuda which are rated a excellent 
we maintain reinsurance coverage to help lessen the effect of losses from catastrophic events  maintaining coverage that currently protects us in the event of a year storm that is  a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a year period 
we use various software products to measure our exposure to catastrophe losses to model the probable maximum loss to us for catastrophe losses such as hurricanes 
in  we purchased four layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance contracts providing coverage for property losses in excess of  up to a maximum of  our reinsurers co participation is of  for the st layer  of  for the nd layer  of  for the rd layer  and of  for the th layer 
in  we have purchased three layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance contracts providing coverage for property losses in excess of  up to a maximum of  our reinsurers co participation is of  for the st layer  of  for the nd layer  and of  for the rd layer 
we also have a casualty excess of loss reinsurance contract for large casualty losses occurring in our automobile  homeowners  dwelling fire  business owners policies  commercial package policies  personal umbrella and commercial umbrella lines of business in excess of  up to a maximum of  with an annual aggregate deductible of we have property excess of loss reinsurance coverage for large property losses  with coverage in excess of  up to a maximum of  for our homeowners  business owner  and commercial package policies 
in addition  we have a quota share reinsurance agreement under which we cede of the premiums and losses under our personal and commercial umbrella policies 
we also have a reinsurance agreement with hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company  which is a quota share agreement under which we cede of the premiums and losses for the equipment breakdown coverage under our business owner policies and commercial package policies 
in the wake of the september  tragedies  reinsurers have begun to exclude coverage for claims in connection with any act of terrorism 
our reinsurance programs for   and excludes coverage for acts of terrorism  except for fire or collapse losses as a result of terrorism  under homeowners  dwelling fire  private passenger automobile and commercial automobile policies 
for business owner policies and commercial package policies  terrorism is excluded if the total insured value is greater than  the terrorism risk insurance act of tria was signed into law on november  and expired december  the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea was signed into law on december   which reauthorizes tria for two years  while expanding the private sector role and reducing the federal share of compensation for insured losses under the program 
the intent of this legislation is to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry for the needs of commercial insurance policyholders with the potential exposure for losses due to acts of terrorism 
the triea provides reinsurance for certified acts of terrorism 
effective january  we issued policy endorsements for all commercial policyholders to comply with triea after obtaining commissioner approval 
as of december   we had no material amounts recoverable from any reinsurer  excluding the residual markets described below 
on march   our board of directors adopted a resolution that prohibits safety from purchasing finite reinsurance without approval by the board 
to date  the company has never purchased a finite reinsurance contract 
in addition to the above mentioned reinsurance programs  we are a participant in car  the massachusetts mandated residual market under which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in massachusetts 
we also participate in the massachusetts property insurance underwriting association in which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by insurers writing homeowners insurance in massachusetts 
k 
competition the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we 
we compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies 
our competitors include companies  which  like us  serve the independent agency market  as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers 
direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers  including increased name recognition  loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and  potentially  lower cost structures 
a material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would adversely affect us 
in the past  competition in the massachusetts private passenger automobile market has included offering significant discounts from the maximum permitted rates  and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not recur 
further  we and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non cash incentives provided to agents 
although a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are do not currently compete in a material way in the massachusetts private passenger automobile market  if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could have a material adverse effect on us 
these companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share  as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies in the future 
in massachusetts  as of december   insurers actively wrote private passenger automobile insurance  according to car 
of these insurers  are national companies which use independent agents to sell their products  are regional or massachusetts only companies which use independent agents to sell their products including us and are national  regional or massachusetts only companies which sell their products directly to policyholders 
our principal competitors within the massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance industry are both regional companies  commerce group  inc and arbella insurance group  which held and market shares based on automobile exposures  respectively  in according to car

investments investment income is an important source of revenue for us and the return on our investment portfolio has a material effect on our net earnings 
our investment objective is to focus on maximizing total returns while investing conservatively 
we maintain a high quality investment portfolio consistent with our established investment policy 
as of december   there were no securities below investment grade as defined by moody s  s p  and the securities valuation office of the naic see further details below in our fixed income securities portfolio 
according to our investment guidelines  no more than of our portfolio may be invested in the securities of any one issuer excluding us government backed securities  and no more than of our portfolio may be invested in securities rated bbb  or the lowest investment grade assigned by moody s 
we continually monitor the mix of taxable and tax exempt securities  in an attempt to maximize our total after tax return

the total of these fixed maturity securities was  and  at fair value and  and  at amortized cost as of december  and  respectively 
as such  the asset backed securities presented exclude such issuers already presented under us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies 
while we have held common equity securities in our investment portfolio in the past  as of december   we held no such securities in our investment portfolio  except for interests in mutual funds to fund the safety insurance company executive incentive compensation plan  a non qualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management 
we made the decision to divest common equity securities in order to maximize the current investment income earned by our portfolio and to reduce our overall investment risk 
we continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase common equity securities 
the principal risks inherent in holding mortgage backed securities and other pass through securities are prepayment and extension risks  which affect the timing of when cash flows will be received 
when interest rates decline  mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities tend to be prepaid more rapidly than anticipated  causing early repayments 
when interest rates rise  the underlying mortgages tend to be prepaid at a slower rate than anticipated  causing the principal repayments to be extended 
although early prepayments may result in acceleration of income from recognition of any unamortized discount  the proceeds typically are reinvested at a lower current yield  resulting in a net reduction of future investment income

net effective yield declined in from as a result of management s investment strategy to shorten the duration of our portfolio  shift to higher rated securities  and increase our tax exempt holdings 
as of december   our portfolio of fixed maturity investments was comprised entirely of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities  us government and agency securities and asset backed securities us  all our securities received a rating assigned by moody s investors service  inc of baa or higher  except the few securities not rated by moody s which received standard and poor s ratings of a or higher  as well as a rating assigned by the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners of or 
the composition of our fixed income security portfolio by moody s rating was as follows december  estimated fair value percent us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies aaa aa a baa not rated standard poor s rating of a or higher total ratings are assigned by moody s  or the equivalent  as discussed above 
such ratings are generally assigned upon the issuance of the securities and are subject to revision on the basis of ongoing evaluations 
ratings in the table are as of the date indicated 
moody s rating system utilizes nine symbols to indicate the relative investment quality of a rated bond 
aaa rated bonds are judged to be of the best quality and are considered to carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
aa rated bonds are also judged to be of high quality by all standards 
together with aaa bonds  these bonds comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds 
bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are considered to be upper medium grade obligations 
baa rated bonds are considered as medium grade obligations  they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured 
bonds rated ba or lower those rated b  caa  ca and c are considered to be too speculative to be of investment quality 
the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners evaluates all public and private bonds purchased as investments by insurance companies 
the securities valuation office assigns one of six investment categories to each security it reviews 
category is the highest quality rating and category is the lowest 
categories and are the equivalent of investment grade debt as defined by rating agencies such as standard poor s ratings services and moody s  while categories are the equivalent of below investment grade securities 
securities valuation office ratings are reviewed at least annually 
at december   approximately of our fixed maturity investments were rated category  and of our fixed maturity investments were rated category  the two highest ratings assigned by the securities valuation office

prepayment rates are influenced by a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages or other collateral to changes in interest rates  a variety of economic  geographic and other factors  and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structures 
n 
ratings am best  which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders  currently assigns safety insurance an a excellent rating 
our a rating was reaffirmed by am best on november  such rating is the third highest rating of ratings that am best assigns to solvent insurance companies  which currently range from a superior to d very vulnerable 
publications of am best indicate that the a rating is assigned to those companies that in am best s opinion have a strong ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as its book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its loss reserves  the adequacy of its surplus  its capital structure  the experience and competence of its management and its market presence 
am best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to purchasers of an insurance company s securities 
in reaffirming safety insurance s rating  am best recognized its excellent capitalization  sustained operating profitability  and favorable market position as an automobile insurer in massachusetts 
am best also noted among our positive attributes favorable operating earnings in recent years  our disciplined underwriting approach  and expertise in the highly regulated massachusetts automobile insurance industry 
am best cited other factors that partially offset these positive attributes  including our geographic concentration  elevated underwriting leverage and limited product scope 
we are subject to the competitive and highly regulated massachusetts private passenger automobile market  which is characterized by mandated rates set by the commissioner 
o 
supervision and regulation introduction 
our principal operations are conducted through the insurance subsidiaries which are subject to comprehensive regulation by the division of insurance  of which the commissioner is the senior official 
the commissioner is appointed by the governor 
we are subject to the authority of the commissioner in many areas of our business under massachusetts law  including our licenses to transact insurance  the premium rates and policy forms we may use  our financial condition including the adequacy of our reserves and provisions for unearned premium  the solvency standards that we must maintain  the type and size of investments we may make  the prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices we must use  and the nature of the transactions we may engage in with our affiliates 
in addition  the commissioner periodically conducts a financial examination of all licensees domiciled in massachusetts 
we were most recently examined for the five year period ending december  the division had no material findings as a result of this examination 
insurance holding company regulation 
our principal operating subsidiaries are insurance companies  and therefore we are subject to certain laws in massachusetts regulating insurance holding company systems 
these laws require that we file a registration statement with the commissioner that discloses the identity  financial condition  capital structure and ownership of each entity within our corporate structure and any transactions among the members of our holding company system 
in some instances  we must provide prior notice to the commissioner for material transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and other affiliates in our holding company system 
these holding company statutes also require  among other things  prior approval of the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions and any acquisition of a domestic insurer 
insurance regulation concerning dividends 
we rely on dividends from the insurance subsidiaries for our cash requirements 
the insurance holding company law of massachusetts requires notice to the commissioner of any dividend to the stockholders of an insurance company 
the insurance subsidiaries may not make an extraordinary dividend until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time 
as historically administered by the commissioner  this provision requires the prior approval by the commissioner of an extraordinary dividend 
an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds  also known as its earned surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
at year end  the statutory surplus of safety insurance was  and its net income for was  a maximum of  will be available by the end of for such dividends without prior approval of the division 
acquisition of control of a massachusetts domiciled insurance company 
massachusetts law requires advance approval by the commissioner of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled in massachusetts 
that law presumes that control exists where any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing or more of our outstanding voting stock 
even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired control if the commissioner determines that control exists in fact 
any purchaser of shares of common stock representing or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of the insurance subsidiaries unless  following application by that purchaser the commissioner determines that the acquisition does not constitute a change of control or is otherwise not subject to regulatory review 
these requirements may deter  delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of our common stock  including transactions that could be advantageous to our stockholders 
protection against insurer insolvency 
massachusetts law requires that insurers licensed to do business in massachusetts participate in the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund 
the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund must pay any claim up to of a policyholder of an insolvent insurer if the claim existed prior to the declaration of insolvency or arose within sixty days after the declaration of insolvency 
members of the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund are assessed the amount the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund deems necessary to pay its obligations and expenses in connection with handling covered claims 
subject to certain exceptions  assessments are made in the proportion that each member s net written premiums for the prior calendar year for all property and casualty lines bore to the corresponding net written premiums for massachusetts insurers insolvency fund members for the same period 
as a matter of massachusetts law  insurance rates and premiums include amounts to recoup any amounts paid by insurers for the costs of the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund 
with respect to private passenger automobile insurance rates and premiums  the commissioner has historically made an adjustment in his or her annual rate decision reflecting any massachusetts insurers insolvency fund related costs reported by the industry in its rate filing 
by statute  no insurer in massachusetts may be assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent of that insurer s direct written premium for the calendar year prior to the assessment 
we account for allocations from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund as underwriting expenses 
in and we incurred charges of  and  respectively  for our allocation from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund for the insolvencies of other insurers 
in  we received a refund of prior years assessments of car also assesses its members as a result of insurer insolvencies 
because car is not able to recover an insolvent company s share of the net car losses from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund  car must increase each of its member s share of the deficit in order to compensate for the insolvent carrier s inability to pay its deficit assessment 
it is anticipated that there will be additional assessments from time to time relating to various insolvencies 
the insurance regulatory information system 
the insurance regulatory information system was developed to help state regulators identify companies that may require special financial attention 
the insurance regulatory information system consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review annual statements and financial ratios 
the statistical phase consists of key financial ratios based on year end data that are generated from the national association of insurance commissioners database annually  each ratio has an established usual range of results 
these ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
a ratio result falling outside the usual range of insurance regulatory information system ratios is not considered a failing result  rather  unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system 
furthermore  in some years  it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges 
generally  an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios 
in  all our ratios for both the insurance subsidiaries were within the normal range except for net change in adjusted policyholders surplus which exceeded the range 
in and  all our ratios for both the insurance subsidiaries were within the normal range except for investment yield  which fell below the range primarily due to our investment strategy to increase tax exempt holdings in our portfolio 
risk based capital requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a formula and model law to implement risk based capital requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies  which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing  declines in asset values arising from market and or credit risk  and off balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non controlled assets  guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and reserve and premium growth 
under massachusetts law  insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the risk based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the risk based capital law provides for four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of total adjusted capital to risk based capital falls 
the first level  the company action level  as defined by the naic  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the commissioner if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the regulatory action level  as defined by the naic requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and requires the commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the authorized control level  as defined by the naic  authorizes the commissioner to take whatever regulatory actions he or she considers necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control  ie  rehabilitation or liquidation  if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the fourth action level is the mandatory control level  as defined by the naic  which requires the commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control if total adjusted capital falls below of the risk based capital amount 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed risk based capital action level 
regulation of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts 
our principal line of business is massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance 
as described in more detail above under b 
the massachusetts property and casualty insurance market  regulation of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts differs significantly from how this line of insurance is regulated in other states 
these differences include the requirements that the premium rate we and all insurers must charge is fixed and established by the commissioner  that our ability and that of our competitors to deviate from the rate set by the commissioner is restricted  and that some of our insurance producers are assigned to us as a matter of law 
see b 
the massachusetts property and casualty insurance market  as discussed above 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a number of risks 
any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  and a corresponding decline in the market price of our common stock 
because we are primarily a private passenger automobile insurance carrier  our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry 
approximately of our direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies 
as a result of our focus on that line of business  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the private passenger automobile insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers which conduct operations in multiple business lines 
because we write insurance only in massachusetts  our business may be adversely affected by conditions in massachusetts 
all of our direct written premiums are generated in massachusetts 
our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in massachusetts 
changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business 
adverse regulatory developments in massachusetts  which could include  among others  reductions in the maximum rates permitted to be charged  inadequate rate increases or more fundamental changes in the design or implementation of the massachusetts automobile insurance regulatory framework  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us  compared to insurers which conduct operations in multiple states 
we have exposure to claims related to severe weather conditions  which may result in an increase in claims frequency and severity 
we are subject to claims arising out of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms and ice storms  that may have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in claims frequency and severity under the private passenger automobile insurance we write when severe weather occurs because a higher incidence of vehicular accidents and other insured losses tend to occur as a result of severe weather conditions 
in addition  we have exposure to an increase in claims frequency and severity under the homeowners and other property insurance we write because property damage may result from severe weather conditions 
because some of our insureds live near the massachusetts coastline  we also have a potential exposure to losses from hurricanes and major coastal storms such as nor easters 
although we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to limit our exposure to these types of natural catastrophes  in the event of a major catastrophe resulting in property losses to us in excess of million  our losses would exceed the limits of this reinsurance 
if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents  it could adversely affect our business 
we market our insurance solely through independent agents 
we must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of independent agents 
some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage or higher commissions 
while we believe that the commissions and services we provide to our agents are competitive with other insurers  changes in commissions  services or products offered by our competitors could make it harder for us to attract and retain independent agents to sell our insurance products 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit 
the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
we compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies 
further  our competitors include other companies which  like us  serve the independent agency market  as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers 
direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers  including increased name recognition  loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and  potentially  lower cost structures 
a material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would directly and negatively affect our profitability and our ability to compete with insurers that do not rely solely on the independent agency market to sell their products 
in the past  competition in the massachusetts personal auto insurance market has included offering significant discounts from the maximum permitted rates  and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not recur 
further  our company and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non cash incentives provided to agents 
although a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are do not currently compete in a material way in the massachusetts personal auto market  if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could reduce our share of the massachusetts market and thereby have a material adverse effect on us 
these companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share  as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel 
as a holding company  safety insurance group  inc is dependent on the results of operations of the safety insurance company 
safety insurance group  inc is a company and a legal entity separate and distinct from safety insurance company  our principal operating subsidiary 
as a holding company without significant operations of its own  the principal sources of safety insurance group  inc s funds are dividends and other distributions from safety insurance company 
our rights to participate in any distribution of assets of safety insurance company are subject to prior claims of policyholders  creditors and preferred stockholders  if any  of safety insurance company except to the extent that our rights  if any  as a creditor are recognized 
consequently  our ability to pay debts  expenses and cash dividends to our stockholders may be limited 
the ability of safety insurance company to pay dividends is subject to limits under massachusetts insurance law 
further  the ability of safety insurance group  inc to pay dividends  and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness or to use the proceeds of equity offerings  will be subject to limits under our revolving credit facility 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by massachusetts and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations 
general regulation 
we are subject to regulation by government agencies in massachusetts  and we must obtain prior approval for certain corporate actions 
we must comply with regulations involving transactions between an insurance company and any of its affiliates  the payment of dividends  the acquisition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  approval or filing of premium rates and policy forms  solvency standards  minimum amounts of capital and surplus which must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured by a single company  limitation of the right to cancel or non renew policies in some lines  regulation of the right to withdraw from markets or terminate involvement with agencies  requirements to participate in residual markets  licensing of insurers and agents  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  and reporting with respect to financial condition 
in addition  insurance department examiners from massachusetts perform periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders 
massachusetts requires that all licensed property and casualty insurers bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as a result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies by participating in the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund insolvency fund 
members of the insolvency fund are assessed a proportionate share of the obligations and expenses of the insolvency fund in connection with an insolvent insurer 
in  the company received a refund of prior years assessments from the insolvency fund of in and  the company received notice of assessments from the insolvency fund amounting to  and  these assessments were made by the insolvency fund to cover the cost of paying eligible claims of policyholders of these insolvent insurers  and by car  to recover the shares of net car losses that would have been assessed to the insolvent companies but for their insolvencies 
in addition  massachusetts has established an underwriting association in order to ensure that property insurance is available for owners of high risk property who are not able to obtain insurance from private insurers 
the losses of this underwriting association are shared by all insurers that write property and casualty insurance in massachusetts 
we are assessed from time to time to pay these losses 
the effect of these assessments could reduce our profitability in any given period and limit our ability to grow our business 
because we are unable to predict with certainty changes in the political  economic or regulatory environments in massachusetts in the future  there can be no assurance that existing insurance related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future or that new restrictive laws will not be enacted and  therefore  it is not possible to predict the potential effects of these laws and regulations on us 
massachusetts personal auto regulation 
we are subject to the extensive regulation of the private passenger automobile insurance industry in massachusetts 
owners of registered automobiles are required to maintain minimum automobile insurance coverages 
generally  we are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant who seeks it 
we are assigned certain agents that have been unable to obtain a voluntary contract with another insurer  on the basis of our market share 
we call these agents exclusive representative producers or erps 
in addition  we are required to participate in a state mandated reinsurance program run by car  to which we cede certain undesirable risks and from which we are allocated a portion of the program s overall losses 
this program operates at an underwriting deficit and results in expense for us 
our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these requirements 
our marketing and underwriting strategies are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  which are mandated by the commissioner 
the commissioner mandated an average rate decrease in private passenger automobile premiums of for the commissioner mandated average rate increases of and for and  respectively  and no rate change for the commissioner announced on december   a statewide average rate decrease for in addition  the commissioner annually establishes the minimum commission rate that insurers must pay their auto insurance agents 
the commissioner approved a commission rate  as a percentage of premiums of    and in    and  respectively 
the commissioner approved a commission rate of for premium rates are set following a proceeding in which the commissioner considers historic information relating to claims costs as well as outside factors affecting insurance costs 
if the information considered does not accurately predict the future benefit and expense costs of insurers  or if the commissioner otherwise sets inadequate premium rates  our future profitability could be decreased 
future increases in commission rates would also decrease our profitability 
we may enter new markets and there can be no assurance that our diversification strategy will be effective 
although we intend to concentrate on our core businesses in massachusetts  we also may seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core businesses into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong 
as a result of a number of factors  including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market  we may not be successful in this diversification 
additionally  in order to carry out any such strategy we would need to obtain the appropriate licenses from the insurance regulatory authority of any such state 
today  we do not possess any licenses outside of massachusetts and we could encounter unexpected regulatory obstacles that prevent us from obtaining these licenses in a timely fashion  or at all 
our failure to maintain a commercially acceptable financial strength rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
am best has currently assigned safety insurance an a excellent rating 
an a rating is ambest s third highest rating  out of possible rating classifications for solvent companies 
an a rating is assigned to insurers that in am best s opinion have a strong ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
moreover  an a rating is assigned to companies that have  on balance  excellent balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile when compared to the standards established by am best 
am best bases its ratings on factors that concern policyholders and not upon factors concerning investor protection 
such ratings are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
an important factor in an insurer s ability to compete effectively is its am best rating 
our am best rating is lower than those of some of our competitors 
any future decrease in our rating could affect our competitive position 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserves  which could significantly affect our business 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that we have established are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the time we established the reserves 
reserves are based on historical claims information  industry statistics and other factors 
the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
if our reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  we would have to treat the amount of such increase as a charge to our earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our reserves and have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves  it has been necessary  and may over time continue to be necessary  to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses 
the historic development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on historical information 
if we lose key personnel  our ability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered 
our future success depends significantly upon the efforts of certain key management personnel  including david f 
brussard  our chief executive officer and president 
we maintain a million key man life insurance policy on mr 
brussard  the proceeds of which are payable to us  but do not maintain any key man insurance on any other executive 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
brussard  begley  kerton  krupa  loranger  patrick  murphy  and berry  the eight members of our management team 
the loss of key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to grow  we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and our ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
market fluctuations and changes in interest rates can have significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio 
our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets 
as of december   of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities and in common equity securities 
certain risks are inherent in connection with debt securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors 
we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses 
in order to reduce risk and to increase our underwriting capacity  we purchase reinsurance 
the availability and the cost of reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are outside of our control 
as a result  we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements 
for example  if reinsurance capacity for homeowners risks were reduced as a result of terrorist attacks or other causes  we would seek to reduce the amount of homeowners business we write 
in addition  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
a significant reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
there are anti takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and in laws of the state of delaware and the commonwealth of massachusetts that could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management or prevent the sale of our company  which could diminish the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware contain provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
for example  our organizational documents provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  prevent stockholders from taking action by written consent  prevent stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders  provide for supermajority voting requirements to amend our certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our bylaws and provide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office 
these provisions will render the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management more difficult 
in addition  these provisions may prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
the massachusetts insurance law prohibits any person from acquiring control of us  and thus indirect control of safety insurance  without the prior approval of the commissioner 
that law presumes that control exists where any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing or more of our outstanding voting stock 
even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired such control if the commissioner determines that such control exists in fact 
therefore  any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face regulatory obstacles which could delay  deter or prevent an acquisition that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
section of the general corporation law of delaware  the jurisdiction in which safety group is organized  may affect the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in certain business combinations including mergers  consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares  for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
an interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation 
future sales of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market  or the possibility or perception of such future sales  could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
investors currently known to be the beneficial owners of greater than of our outstanding common stock  hold approximately of the common stock of safety insurance group  inc on a fully diluted basis 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of shares by our existing stockholders  or the availability of shares for future sale  will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders  or the possibility or perception that such sales could occur  could cause the prevailing market prices for our common stock to decrease 
if such sales reduce the market price of our common stock  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets may be adversely affected

unresolved staff comments none item properties we conduct almost all of our operations in approximately  square feet of leased space at custom house street in downtown boston  massachusetts 
our lease expires in december item legal proceedings our insurance subsidiaries are parties to a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of their insurance business 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
other than these lawsuits  we are not involved in any legal proceedings

executive summary and overview in this discussion  safety refers to safety insurance group  inc and our company  we  us and our refer to safety insurance group  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries consist of safety insurance company safety insurance  safety indemnity insurance company  whiteshirts asset management corporation wamc  f k a thomas black insurance agency  inc  and whiteshirts management corporation  f k a rbs  inc  which is wamc s holding company 
we are a leading provider of private passenger automobile insurance in massachusetts 
in addition to private passenger automobile insurance which represented of our direct written premiums in  we offer a portfolio of other insurance products  including commercial automobile of direct written premiums  homeowners of direct written premiums  dwelling fire  umbrella and business owner policies totaling of direct written premiums 
operating exclusively in massachusetts through our insurance company subsidiaries  safety insurance and safety indemnity insurance company together referred to as the insurance subsidiaries  we have established strong relationships with independent insurance agents in locations throughout massachusetts 
we have used these relationships and our extensive knowledge of the massachusetts market to become the second largest private passenger automobile insurance carrier in massachusetts  capturing an approximate share of the massachusetts private passenger automobile market in  according to the car cession volume analysis report of february   based on automobile exposures 
these statistics total  for each vehicle insured  the number of months during the year insurance for that vehicle is in effect  to arrive at an aggregate number of car months for each insurer  this aggregate number  divided by  equals the insurer s number of car years  a measure we refer to in this discussion as automobile exposures 
massachusetts automobile insurance market we are subject to the extensive regulation of the private passenger automobile insurance industry in massachusetts  which represented of our direct written premiums in owners of registered automobiles in massachusetts are required to maintain minimum automobile insurance coverages 
we are required to participate in a state mandated reinsurance program run by car to which we cede certain unprofitable risks and from which we are allocated a portion of the overall losses 
as a servicing carrier of car  we are required to issue a policy to all qualified applicants 
this program operates at an underwriting deficit 
this deficit is allocated among every massachusetts automobile insurance company  including us  based on a complex formula that takes into consideration a company s voluntary market share  the rate at which it cedes business to car  and the company s utilization of a credit system car has designed to encourage carriers to reduce their use of car 
in addition  based on our market share  we are assigned certain licensed producers by car that have been unable to obtain a voluntary contract with another insurer 
we call these agents exclusive representative producers  or erps 
on december   the commissioner approved new rules for car  which became effective on january  the approved rules 
on january   we filed  on form k  an estimate of the financial impact the approved rules may have on us and we stated that a lawsuit had been filed in suffolk superior court by commerce insurance company against the commissioner that seeks an order permanently enjoining implementation and or enforcement of the approved rules 
certain erps  arbella mutual insurance company and the center for insurance research intervened as plaintiffs and car intervened as a defendant in this lawsuit 
on june   the massachusetts superior court ruled that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to implement the approved rules and ordered them vacated 
as a result  the approved rules did not go into effect 
the commissioner appealed the decision of the massachusetts superior court 
on october   the massachusetts supreme judicial court agreed to take direct appellate review of the commissioner s appeal 
at the present time  we are unable to predict whether the commissioner s appeal will be successful 
on june   car approved rules to modify the erp subscription relief process  making the reassignment of erp exposures from an oversubscribed servicing carrier more timely and responsive  while enhancing equity in the erp distribution for all servicing carriers the erp subscription rules 
also  the current practice of two and three party agreements between erps and servicing carriers would be prohibited 
on september   the commissioner approved the erp subscription rules  and instructed car to complete a redistribution of all erps that will establish for all servicing carriers overall parity in the quantity and quality of their erp exposures 
the redistribution plan for erps as adopted by the car governing committee on november and december   was approved by the commissioner on january  on january  car notified each reassigned erp and all servicing carriers of the redistribution 
according to the january  car private passenger erp redistribution summary  safety erps with  exposures were assigned to other servicing carriers beginning with new business effective march  and renewal business may  in addition  car assigned erps with  exposures from other servicing carriers to safety  however of these erps with  exposures were given voluntary contracts by their former servicing carrier or other carriers and are no longer eligible for assignment to safety as erps 
we expect that the redistribution of erps will eliminate our disproportionate share of high loss ratio erp business  and would therefore result in a reduction of the expense we incur because of our disproportionate share of high loss ratio erps 
however  it is possible that other servicing carriers or erps could bring challenges  with regards to the redistribution of erps  and as a result there can be no assurances that our expenses will be reduced 
on june   the governor filed legislation that would introduce more competition into the massachusetts automobile insurance marketplace  reduce rates for good drivers  target fraud and excessive personal injury costs  and allow insurers rate flexibility 
at this time we are unable to predict whether the governor s legislation will be enacted by the legislature 
beginning january  car has implemented a limited servicing carrier program lsc for ceded commercial automobile policies 
car approved safety and five other servicing carriers through a request for proposal to process approximately  of ceded commercial automobile business based on car data as of december   which will be spread equitably amongst the six servicing carriers 
each year  the commissioner sets maximum premium rates that may be charged and minimum commissions that must be paid to agents for private passenger automobile insurance 
the commissioner announced on december   a statewide average private passenger automobile insurance rate decrease for  compared to a decrease for coinciding with the rate decision  the commissioner also approved an commission rate agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance  as a percentage of premiums  compared to a commission rate of in while state mandated average maximum private passenger automobile insurance rates decreased for  our average premium per automobile exposure in the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  by approximately 
this increase was primarily the result of purchases of new automobiles by our insureds 
we believe that the continued benefits of our rate pursuit initiative  which validates insured rating classifications and discount eligibility  also contributed to the increase in our average premiums received per automobile exposure 
the table below shows average massachusetts mandated private passenger automobile premium rate changes and changes in our average premium per automobile exposure from massachusetts private passenger rate decisions state mandated safety change in average rate average premium per year change automobile exposure source commissioner rate decisions for source safety insurance 
statutory accounting principles our results are reported in accordance with gaap  which differ from amounts reported in accordance with statutory accounting principles sap as prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
specifically  under gaap policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas  under sap  such assets are designated as non admitted assets  and charged directly against statutory surplus 
these assets consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding over ninety days  federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturities securities  which are classified as available for sale  are reported at current market values  rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or market  depending on the specific type of security  as required by sap 
equity securities are reported at quoted market values  which may differ from the national association of insurance commissioners market values as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense  rather than recorded directly to surplus as regards policyholders  as required by sap 
admittance testing may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non admitted portions of deferred tax assets 
under gaap reporting  a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax asset and reflected as an expense 
insurance ratios the property and casualty insurance industry uses the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percent of net earned premiums plus the expense ratio underwriting expenses as a percent of net written premiums  if calculated on a sap basis  or net earned premiums  if calculated on a gaap basis 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments or finance and other service income 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  weather  economic and social conditions and other factors 
our statutory insurance ratios are outlined in the following table for the years ended december  statutory ratios loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio under gaap  the loss ratio is computed in the same manner as under sap  but the expense ratio is determined by matching underwriting expenses to the period over which net premiums were earned  rather than to the period that net premiums were written 
our gaap insurance ratios are outlined in the following table for the years ended december  gaap ratios loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio stock based compensation on june   the board adopted the management omnibus incentive plan the incentive plan 
the incentive plan provides for a variety of awards  including nonqualified stock options nqsos  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock rs awards 
on december   there were  shares available for future grant 
the board and the compensation committee intend to issue more awards under the incentive plan in the future 
grants outstanding under the incentive plan as of december  were comprised of  restricted shares and  nonqualified stock options 
grants made under the incentive plan are as follows exercise type of number of price or equity awards fair value awarded effective date granted per share vesting terms expiration date nqsos november  years  annually november  nqsos february  years  annually february  nqsos march  years  march  nqsos august  years  annually august  nqsos march  years  annually march  rs march  years  n a nqsos august  years  annually august  nqsos march  years  annually march  rs march  years  n a rs march  no vesting period n a the exercise price of the options grant effective on november  is equal to the ipo price of our stock on that same day 
the exercise price of the remaining option grants is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant effective date 
the fair value of the restricted stock grant is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant effective date 
the shares cannot be sold  assigned  pledged  or otherwise transferred  encumbered or disposed of until the recipient is no longer a member of our board of directors 
reinsurance we reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten  thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses  primarily in our homeowners line of business 
as of january  our catastrophe reinsurance provides gross per occurrence reinsurance coverage up to  our catastrophe reinsurance protects us in the event of a year storm that is  a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a year period 
swiss re  our primary reinsurer  maintains an am best rating of a superior 
all of our other reinsurers have an am best rating of a excellent or better except for montpelier re  endurance re and amlin bermuda which are rated a excellent 
we are a participant in car  a state established body that runs the residual market reinsurance programs for both private passenger and commercial automobile insurance in massachusetts under which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in massachusetts 
we also participate in the massachusetts property insurance underwriting association fair plan in which premiums  expenses  losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by all insurers writing homeowners insurance in massachusetts 
at december   we had no material amounts recoverable from any reinsurer  excluding the residual markets described above 
on march   our board of directors adopted a resolution that prohibits safety from purchasing finite reinsurance without approval by the board 
to date  the company has never purchased a finite reinsurance contract 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
b 
critical accounting policies and estimates loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting to us of that loss and our final payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
our reserves represent estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses of investigating and paying those losses  or loss adjustment expenses 
every quarter  we review our previously established reserves and adjust them  if necessary 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
ibnr reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience 
we review and make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
a change in any of these factors from the assumption implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves  and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors 
management determines the company s loss and lae reserves estimate based upon the work of the company s actuaries and management s own assessment of reasonable reserves 
a reasonable estimate is derived primarily by considering a range of indications calculated by the company s actuaries using generally accepted actuarial techniques 
our key assumptions are the ultimate frequency and severity of claims  based upon the most recent ten years of claims reported to the company and the data car reports to us to calculate our share of the residual market  as of the date of the applicable balance sheet 
for each accident year and each coverage within a line of business our actuaries calculate reserve ranges using actuarial techniques such as paid loss indications this method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic paid loss trends 
this method tends to be used on short tail lines such as automobile physical damage 
incurred loss indications this method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic incurred loss trends 
this method tends to be used on long tail lines of business such as automobile liability and homeowner s liability 
bornhuetter ferguson indications this method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of an expected amount of ibnr  which is added to current incurred losses or paid losses 
this method tends to be used on small  immature  or volatile lines of business  such as our bop and umbrella lines of business 
bodily injury code indications this method projects ultimate loss estimates for our private passenger and commercial automobile bodily injury coverage based upon extrapolations of the historic number of accidents and the historic number of bodily injury claims per accident 
projected ultimate bodily injury claims are then segregated into expected claims by type of injury eg soft tissue injury vs 
hard tissue injury based on past experience 
an ultimate severity  or average paid loss amounts  is estimated based upon extrapolating historic trends 
projected ultimate loss estimates using this method are the aggregate of estimated losses by injury type 
such techniques assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
it is possible that the final outcome may fall above or below these amounts as a result of a number of factors  including immature data  sparse data  or significant growth in a line of business 
using these methodologies our actuaries established a range of reasonable possible estimations for net reserves of approximately  to  as of december   as compared to a range of  to  for in general  the low and high values of the ranges represent reasonable minimum and maximum values of the indications based on the techniques described above 
the following tables present the recorded reserves and the range of estimations by line of business for net loss and lae reserves as of december  and december  range of net reserves for losses and lae as of december  line of business low recorded high private passenger auto commercial auto homeowners all other total range of net reserves for losses and lae as of december  line of business low recorded high private passenger auto commercial auto homeowners all other total the company s net loss and lae reserves  based on management s best estimate  were set at  as of december   as compared to  for for our private passenger and commercial auto lines of business as of december   due to the relatively long time we have been writing these lines of insurance  and our stable long term trends in frequency and severity  the range of reserves are relatively narrow compared to the mid point estimation and we recorded reserves slightly higher than the mid point of the range 
for our private passenger line as of december  we recorded reserves at the mid point of the range  and for our commercial automobile line of business we recorded reserves higher than the range due to our rapid growth in this line over the years prior to for our homeowners and all other lines of business as of december   due to the relatively short time we have been writing these lines of business  and the resulting immature data available for our analysis  the range of reserves are relatively wide compared to the mid point estimation and we recorded reserves closer to the high of the range of projections 
for our homeowners and all other lines of business as of december   we recorded reserves higher than the range for homeowners and we recorded reserves very close to the high of the range of projections for all other lines of business 
the following tables present information by line of business for our net reserves for losses and lae as of december  and december  net reserves for losses and lae as of december  line of business direct less ceded assumed net private passenger auto car assumed private passenger net private passenger auto commercial auto car assumed commercial auto net commercial auto homeowners fair plan assumed homeowners net homeowners all other total net reserves for losses and lae net reserves for losses and lae as of december  line of business direct less ceded assumed net private passenger auto car assumed private passenger net private passenger auto commercial auto car assumed commercial auto net commercial auto homeowners fair plan assumed homeowners net homeowners all other total net reserves for losses and lae car loss and loss adjustment expense reserves we are a participant in car and assume a significant portion of losses and lae on business ceded by the industry participants to car 
we estimate reserves for assumed losses and lae that have not yet been reported to us by car 
our estimations are based upon the same factors we use for our own reserves  plus additional factors due to the nature of and the information we receive from car 
the car deficit  which consists of premium ceded to car less car losses and lae  is allocated among every automobile insurance company writing business in massachusetts based on a complex formula the participation ratio that takes into consideration a company s voluntary market share  the amount of business it cedes to car and credits the company earns under a system car has designed to encourage carriers to voluntarily write business in selected under priced classes and territories 
we receive a settlement of balances report from car that reports our share of car premium  losses and lae  on a lagged basis  seventy five days after the end of every quarter 
car published financial data is always at least one quarter behind the financial data we report 
for example  when we reported our financial results for the year ended december   we had nine months of reported car financial data  and we had to estimate what car would report to us for the last three months of the year 
we receive our final calendar year participation ratio report from car eight months after the end of that year  and thus we have to estimate for six quarters our share of the car deficit 
for example  for the year ended december  we had to estimate our policy year car participation ratio beginning with the first quarter of through the second quarter of because of the lag in car estimates  and in order to try to validate to the extent possible the information car does provide  we must try to estimate the effects of the actions of our competitors in order to establish our participation ratio 
before final participation ratios are available  we estimate the size of car and the resulting deficit based on historical analysis of car results  and estimations of our competitors current cession strategies 
even after our final participation ratio is available from car  we must continue to estimate the size of car  and the resulting deficit based upon data published by car and our own continuing analysis 
as a result  changes in our reserves for car may continue to occur until all claims are finally settled 
the loss reserving committee at car meets days after the end of each quarter to estimate the car deficit for all active policy years and publishes estimations  which we use to estimate our share of the deficit 
the estimation that car calculates is based on data it collects from servicing carriers which settle  reserve and report claims using a variety of methods 
any delays or errors in the collection of this data could have a significant impact on the accuracy of car s estimations 
although we rely to a significant extent in setting our reserves on the information car provides  we are cautious in our use of that information  both because of the delays described above and because the car estimates incorporate data car receives from all other car servicing carriers in massachusetts 
we do not have direct access to that data or firsthand knowledge of how those carriers are currently conducting their operations 
as a result  we are cautious in recording car reserves for the calendar years that we have to estimate our participation ratio and these reserves are subject to significant judgments and estimates 
sensitivity analysis establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
there can be no certainty that currently established reserves based on our key assumptions regarding frequency and severity in our lines of business  or our assumptions regarding our share of the car loss will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized 
for the year ended december  a percentage point change in the loss and lae ratio would result in a change in reserves of  each percentage point change in the loss and loss expense ratio would have a  effect on net income  or per diluted share 
our assumptions consider that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for establishing our reserves 
our key assumptions could have a reasonable possible range of plus or minus percentage points for each estimation 
however  as demonstrates  there is no guarantee that our assumptions will not have more than a percentage point variation 
the following sensitivity tables present information for each of our primary lines of business on the effect each percentage point change in each of our key assumptions on unpaid frequency and severity could have on our direct minus ceded loss and lae reserves and net income for the year ended december  in evaluating the information in the table  it should be noted that a percentage point change in a single assumption would change estimated reserves by percentage point

primarily due to an improvement in car results  the company s prior year reserves decreased by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s prior year reserves increased by for the year ended december  the following table presents a comparison of prior year development of our net reserves for losses and lae for the years ended december   and prior year net loss and lae reserve development summary for the years ended december  accident year prior all prior years the decrease in prior year reserves during the period resulted from re estimations of prior year ultimate loss and lae liabilities and is composed primarily of a reduction of  in car assumed reserves and a reduction of  in the company s automobile reserves 
the decrease in prior year reserves during the period is composed primarily of a reduction of  in car assumed reserves  a reduction of  in our homeowners line of business  and an increase of  in the company s automobile reserves 
the increase in prior year reserves during the period is composed primarily of a reduction of  in our automobile reserves  and an increase of  in car assumed reserves 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past experience

in addition  we reduced our retained private passenger automobile reserves for the and accident years by  and  respectively  primarily due to better than previously estimated severity on our established bodily injury case reserves during our commercial automobile line of business prior year reserves decreased by  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to more favorable commercial automobile bodily injury severity than previously estimated on our established case reserves during our homeowners line of business prior year reserves decreased by  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to improved fair plan results for the  and accident years of  and respectively  and better than previously estimated severity on property reserves on our established case reserves for and of and  respectively  partially offset by increased severity on our established case reserves for of  the improved fair plan results were due primarily to the increase in business written by the fair plan in massachusetts coastal territories such as cape cod without the occurrence of a catastrophe 
in estimating all our loss reserves  including car  we follow the guidance prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards fas no

other than temporary impairments 
we use a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in market values below cost or amortized cost of our investments 
this methodology ensures that we evaluate available evidence concerning any declines in a disciplined manner 
in our determination of whether a decline in market value below amortized cost is an other than temporary impairment  we consider and evaluate several factors and circumstances including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period typically six months or longer in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our amortized cost  our ability and intent to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of our costs  and any other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
we record other than temporary impairments as realized losses  which serve to reduce net income and earnings per share 
we record temporary losses as unrealized losses  which do not impact net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive net income 
the risks inherent in our assessment of other than temporary impairments include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  or that the credit assessment could change in the near term  resulting in a charge to earnings

our principal source of funds to meet our obligations and pay dividends to shareholders  therefore  is dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries  principally safety insurance 
safety is the borrower under our credit facilities 
safety insurance s sources of funds primarily include premiums received  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
safety insurance s principal uses of cash are the payment of claims  operating expenses and taxes  the purchase of investments and payment of dividends to safety 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively

safety borrowed the entire  under this credit facility at the closing of the ipo and paid down the balance to  on december  with the approximately  net proceeds from the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option for  shares of our common stock 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at our option at either i the libor rate plus per annum or ii the higher of citizens bank of massachusetts prime rate or above the federal funds rate plus per annum 
interest only is payable prior to maturity 
the obligations of safety under the credit facility are secured by pledges of the assets of safety and the capital stock of safety s operating subsidiaries 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the non insurance company subsidiaries of safety 
the credit facility contains covenants including requirements to maintain minimum risk based capital ratios and statutory surplus of safety insurance as well as limitations or restrictions on indebtedness  liens  dividends  and other matters 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
bank of america was the lender under this credit facility 
under an agreement effective on june   bank of america assigned the  credit facility to citizens bank of massachusetts

regulatory matters our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of the commissioner 
the massachusetts statute limits the dividends an insurer may pay in any twelve month period  without the prior permission of the commissioner  to the greater of i of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding december or ii the insurer s net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
our insurance company subsidiaries may not declare an extraordinary dividend defined as any dividend or distribution that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the limits established by massachusetts statute until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected 
as historically administered by the commissioner  this provision requires the commissioner s prior approval of an extraordinary dividend 
under massachusetts law  an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds  also known as earned surplus  and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs

during the year ended december   safety insurance recorded dividends to safety of  the maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends 
on february   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  on november   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  which was paid on december  on august   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  which was paid on september  on may   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  which was paid on june  on february   our board approved a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share  or  which was paid on march  we plan to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends in  depending on our financial position and the regularity of our cash flows 
management believes that the current level of cash flow from operations provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the next months 
we expect to be able to continue to meet our operating needs after the next months from internally generated funds 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond such twelve month period is dependent upon such factors as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
we expect that we would need to borrow or issue capital stock if we needed additional funds  for example  to pay for an acquisition or a significant expansion of our operations 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to us at such time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material obligations under a guarantee contract meeting the characteristics identified in paragraph of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we have no material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity 
we have no material obligations  including contingent obligations  under contracts that would be accounted for as derivative instruments 
we have no obligation  including contingent obligations  arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity held by  and material to  us  where such entity provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
we have no direct investments in real estate and no holdings of mortgages secured by commercial real estate 
accordingly  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we have obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows payments due by period within two to three four to five after five one year years years years total loss and lae reserves capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations as of december   the company had loss and lae reserves of  reinsurance recoverables of  and net loss and lae reserves of  our loss and lae reserves are estimates as described in more detail under critical accounting policies and estimates 
the specific amounts and timing of obligations related to case reserves  ibnr reserves and related lae reserves are not set contractually  and the amounts and timing of these obligations are unknown 
based upon our cumulative claims paid over the last ten years  the company estimates that its loss and lae reserves will be paid in the period shown above 
while management believes that historical performance of loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claims payments  there is inherent uncertainty in this estimated projected settlement of loss and lae reserves  and as a result these estimates will differ  perhaps significantly  from actual future payments 
our operations typically generate substantial positive cash flows from operations as most premiums are received in advance of the time when claim and benefit payments are required 
these positive operating cash flows are expected to continue to meet our liquidity requirements  including any unexpected variations in the timing of claim settlements

forward looking statements forward looking statements might include one or more of the following  among others projections of revenues  income  earnings per share  capital expenditures  dividends  capital structure or other financial items  descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations  products or services  forecasts of future economic performance  liquidity  need for funding and income  and descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  aim  projects  or words of similar meaning and expressions that indicate future events and trends  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
all statements that address expectations or projections about the future  including statements about the company s strategy for growth  product development  market position  expenditures and financial results  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
by their nature  forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  that could cause actual future conditions  events  results or trends to differ significantly and or materially from historical results or those projected in the forward looking statements 
these factors include but are not limited to the competitive nature of our industry and the possible adverse effects of such competition 
although a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are do not currently compete in a material way in the massachusetts private passenger automobile market  if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could have a material adverse effect on us 
other significant factors include conditions for business operations and restrictive regulations in massachusetts  the possibility of losses due to claims resulting from severe weather  the possibility that the commissioner may approve future rule changes that change the operation of the residual market  our possible need for and availability of additional financing  and our dependence on strategic relationships  among others  and other risks and factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the sec

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have exposure to market risk through our investment activities and our financing activities 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we use both fixed and variable rate debt as sources of financing 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments and from our financing activities 
our fixed maturity investments include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities  corporate bonds and asset backed securities  most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates 
we manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and board and consultation with third party financial advisors 
as a general matter  we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities  and the majority of our liabilities are short tail 
our goal is to maximize the total after tax return on all of our investments 
an important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer term investments to pay claims 
based upon the results of interest rate sensitivity analysis  the following tables show the interest rate risk of our investments in fixed maturities  including preferred stocks with characteristics of fixed maturities  measured in terms of fair value which is equal to the carrying value for all our fixed maturity securities 
basis basis point change no change point change as of december  estimated fair value estimated increase decrease in fair value as of december  estimated fair value estimated increase decrease in fair value an important market risk for all of our long term debt is interest rate risk 
we continue to monitor the interest rate environment and to evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach 
with respect to floating rate debt  we are also exposed to the effects of changes in prevailing interest rates 
at december  we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility 
during the year  the weighted average variable interest rate on our credit facility was 
a change in the prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately for  assuming that all of such debt is outstanding for the entire year 
equity risk 
equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
in the past  our exposure to changes in equity prices primarily resulted from our holdings of common stocks  mutual funds and other equities 
while we have in the past held common equity securities in our investment portfolio  presently we hold none  except for interests in mutual funds to fund the executive deferred compensation plan 
we continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase equity securities 
we principally managed equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques
