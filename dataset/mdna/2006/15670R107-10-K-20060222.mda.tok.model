overview we are a molecular diagnostics company that develops  manufactures  and markets fully integrated systems for genetic analysis in the clinical  industrial and biothreat markets 
our systems enable rapid  sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic based diseases by automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures 
molecular testing involves a number of complicated and time intensive steps  including sample preparation  dna amplification and detection 
our easy to use systems integrate these steps and analyze complex biological samples in our proprietary test cartridges 
we are focusing our efforts on those applications where rapid molecular testing is particularly important  such as identifying infectious disease and cancer in the clinical market  food  agricultural and environmental testing in the industrial market  and identifying bio terrorism agents in the biothreat market 
our two principal instrument platforms are our smartcycler and genexpert systems 
our initial product platform  the smartcycler  integrates dna amplification and detection to allow rapid genetic analysis of a sample 
we commenced sales of the smartcycler in may and we have sold approximately  units to date to a wide range of customers 
our second product platform  the genexpert  integrates automated sample preparation with our smartcycler amplification and detection technology 
we launched the genexpert system in the biothreat market in the third quarter of and we launched it in the clinical market with a research use only ruo hematological oncology test  bcr abl  late in development of our initial fda product for detection of methicillin resistant staphylococus aureus mrsa continues and our products for detection of group b streptococcus gbs and enterovirus are currently in clinical trials 
we sell our products through both direct sales and various distribution channels worldwide 
in addition to our own activities  we are collaborating with strategic partners to co develop tests for use on our instruments 
a northrop grumman led consortium that includes cepheid and other subcontractors has developed the bds for the united states postal service usps 
this consortium was awarded a production contract with the usps which had two phases both of which have been exercised 
we completed shipping genexpert modules for both phases in in addition  we are currently delivering on a purchase order for million anthrax test cartridges for use with the bds  which we expect to fulfill by the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in december  we entered into an agreement for a strategic commercial relationship with biomerieux for biomerieux to develop dna testing products using their proprietary nucleic acid sequence based amplification nasba technology to be run on systems employing our genexpert platforms 
under the agreement  biomerieux has paid us a million license fee  and an additional million payment will become due when and if biomerieux commercializes its first product based on our technology 
we may also receive potential product purchases and royalty payments on end user genexpert test cartridge sales under the agreement if any such products are introduced 
the million license fee received from biomerieux was deferred and is being amortized over the period of approximately five years from the effective date  which represents the estimated period of our continuing involvement under the collaboration agreement 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a patent license agreement with applera corporation  through its applied biosystems business group abi and its celera diagnostics joint venture  and  effective july   we entered into a patent license agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche  each of which provides for non exclusive worldwide licenses to make  use  and sell our products incorporating technologies covered by applera s and roche s respective patents 
under the license agreements  we agreed to pay aggregate license fees of million  of which million had been paid as of december   and million will be paid in we also agreed to pay applera and roche ongoing royalties on sales of products incorporating their licensed patents 
in connection with the license agreements  we recorded intangible assets of million  representing the present value of license fee obligations net of imputed interest of million 
the intangible assets related to the applera and roche licenses are being amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of approximately and years  respectively  with the amortization recorded as part of the cost of product sales 
on september   cepheid entered into a license agreement with abaxis  inc  effective as of september   pursuant to which abaxis granted cepheid a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to certain abaxis patents relating to lyophilization technology 
under the agreement and the licensed patents  cepheid will be able to make  distribute and sell products for nucleic acid based amplification tests 
in exchange for the license rights  cepheid agreed to i make an upfront license payment  ii pay royalties during the term of the agreement and iii pay a yearly license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement  which fee will be creditable against any royalties due during such calendar year 
cepheid may terminate the agreement for any reason upon days written notice to abaxis 
in november  cepheid entered into a license agreement with dxs limited dxs  a private united kingdom based company  pursuant to which dxs granted cepheid a non exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to the dxs scorpions patents and other intellectual property rights relating to its scorpions technology for the real time pcr detection of nucleic acid amplification 
this amends a december agreement  which provided for license rights to develop and commercialize license technology in the environmental  veterinarian  forensics identity relationship testing  and agricultural fields 
under the agreement  and subject to certain limitations set forth therein  cepheid will be able to use the licensed rights to develop and sell test products incorporating the licensed technology in the human in vitro diagnostics field 
sales channels we sell our products through both direct and other distribution channels 
in the united states  we sell through our direct sales force in the industrial and clinical molecular diagnostics markets  as well as through a non exclusive distributor  fisher scientific company llc fisher  in the industrial market 
additional sales occur through our collaborations including geneohm sciences  inc and veridex 
in europe  we sell primarily through distributors 
in japan and other parts of the world  we sell solely through distributors 
through cepheid sa  our french subsidiary  we have established additional distributors in europe  the middle east  india and south africa 
we expect to continue to expand our sales efforts into other territories throughout the world by adding distributors 

table of contents research and development since our inception  we have devoted significant resources to research and development  particularly in developing the technologies for our smartcycler and genexpert platforms and  more recently  developing tests and asrs for use on those platforms 
research and development expenses were approximately million in  million in  and million in we expect that our research and development expenses will increase marginally in as we expect to complete the development and clinical trials for our mrsa test and begin research on other tests 
revenues during  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales of genexpert anthrax cartridges and modules to northrop grumman and smiths detection for use in the usps program  from sales of smartcyclers and associated disposables and reagents and  to a lesser extent  from contract revenue primarily derived from the amortization of the up front license payments in connection with our collaboration with biomerieux 
during the third quarter of  we received a purchase order from northrop grumman for approximately million anthrax test cartridges over months commencing in august critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of intangible assets  inventory reserve  warranty accrual and stock based compensation to be critical accounting policies 
inherent in our determination of when to recognize revenue and how to evaluate our intangible assets  and in our calculation of our inventory reserve  warranty accrual and stock based compensation expense  are a number of significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments include deciding whether the elements required to recognize revenue from a particular arrangement are present  estimating the fair value of an intangible asset  which represents the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the intangible asset  and estimating the amount of inventory obsolescence and warranty costs associated with shipped products and estimating the useful life and volatility of stock awards granted 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
determining whether the criteria for recognizing revenue including  for example  determining whether there is sufficient evidence that an arrangement exists  the collectibility of billings are probable and whether contractual performance obligations and milestones have been satisfied have been met requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect our operating results 
for example  our determination of the probability of collection is based upon assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or publicly available credit reports 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered in assessing probability of collection 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in deciding whether collectibility is reasonably assured  and such judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenues and our results of operations 
product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped  there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
no right of return exists for our products except in the case of damaged goods 
we have not experienced any significant returns of our products 

table of contents contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of fees earned under technology license arrangements  fees for services rendered under research and development arrangements  for grants and government sponsored research agreements and for milestone payments and royalties received under license and collaboration agreements 
deferred revenue is recorded when funds are received in advance of technologies to be delivered or services to be performed 
license revenue is generally recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
however  in multiple element revenue arrangements  if the delivered technology does not have stand alone value or if we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered products or services  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered technology is deferred and amortized over the related involvement period in which the remaining products or services are provided to the customer 
research and development and government sponsored research contract revenues are recognized as the related services are performed based on the performance requirements of the relevant contract 
under the agreements  we are required to perform specific research and development activities and are compensated based on the costs  or costs plus a mark up  associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  assuming there are no continuing performance obligations related to that milestone 
incentive milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the arrangement and are normally triggered by events external to cepheid 
royalties are based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured  and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the customer 
impairment of intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of rights to certain patented technologies that we purchased in and intangible assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  on a straight line basis 
amortization of intangible assets is included in cost of product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we review our intangible assets for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we conduct the impairment review at least annually  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets  the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
there is significant judgment in estimating future cash flows and fair value 
there were no impairment charges recorded in inventory and warranty provisions we maintain provisions for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs that we believe are reasonable and that are based on our historical experience and current expectations for future performance 
the inventory provision is established using management s estimate of the potential future obsolescence or excess of inventory 
as of december   the provision for inventory obsolescence was approximately million 
a substantial decrease in demand for our products or the introduction of new products could lead to excess inventories and could require us to increase our provision for inventory obsolescence 
our current estimates 
table of contents and assumptions are consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
cepheid warrants its instrument products to be free from defects for a period of to months from the date of sale and its disposable products to be free from defects 
accordingly  a provision for the estimated cost of warranty repair or replacement is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty provision is established using management s estimate of future failure rates and of the future costs of repairing any instrument failures during the warranty period or replacing any disposable products with defects 
significant changes in the failure rates of our products could lead to increased warranty costs and require us to increase our warranty provision 
as of december  and december   the accrued warranty liability was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation the preparation of the consolidated financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we have chosen the black scholes model for implementation of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas no clarifies treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage  specifying that such costs should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
the new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production 
companies must apply the standard prospectively 
beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year  we will be required to adopt sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in fasb statement  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
beginning with our first quarter of fiscal year  we will be required to adopt sfas r and will recognized share based compensation cost in our results of operations 
we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma 
table of contents disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
cepheid plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  in we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations 
the amounts related to the adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement r as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  and whether we will be in a taxable position 
there is no tax impact related to the prior periods since we are in a net loss position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces apbo no 
apbo and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
apbo previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of change a cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle whereas sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable 
sfas enhances the consistency of financial information between periods 
sfas will be effective beginning with cepheid s first quarter of fiscal year cepheid does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position

under the agreement  computed gross margin on anthrax cartridge sales are shared equally between the two parties 
the collaboration profit sharing was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in collaboration profit sharing was the result of increased anthrax cartridge sales under the usps bds program and this expense will remain proportional to the sales of anthrax cartridges under the usps bds program

the line of credit expires on november   at which time any outstanding balance on the line of credit will be due 
as of december  and  we had million outstanding under this line 
the agreement was subsequently amended in may to increase the existing line of credit to million and to add equipment financing line of million 
cepheid borrowed the full amount of the equipment financing line payable over equal monthly installments 
at december   the outstanding balance under the equipment financing line is million 
the equipment line of credit and revolving line of credit are collateralized by the company s accounts receivable  certain equipment  tenant improvements or other personal property of cepheid financed pursuant to the agreement and bear an annual interest rate  at cepheid s option  equal to the lender s prime rate or 
table of contents libor plus per annum 
the interest rate at december  for the equipment line of credit and revolving line of credit were and respectively 
the agreement  as amended  contains a financial covenant that requires cepheid to maintain at least of the outstanding balance of all of our indebtedness  as such term is defined in the agreement  in cash or investments with the lender and a minimum of million in unrestricted cash in total 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid could vary in some circumstances depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec and in fr financial condition outlook we plan to continue to make expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity  to support our activities in sales and marketing and research and development  and to support our working capital needs 
in  we expect to spend approximately million for capital equipment 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through at least the end of we used million in cash excluding net proceeds from marketable securities of million in our operations and investing activities during we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for the next twelve months 
this expectation is based on our current and long term operating plan and may change as a result of many factors  including our future capital requirements and our ability to increase revenues and reduce expenses  which  in many instances  depend on a number of factors outside our control 
for example  our future cash use will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology or to use our technology in new markets  and the availability of other financing 
in the future  we may seek additional funds to support our strategic business needs and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or equity related securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms to meet our business needs  our business may be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our investments in interest bearing assets are subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our interest bearing portfolio  which consists of cash and cash equivalents  in short term commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of the investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore we have not included quantitative tabular disclosure in this form k 
we do not enter into financial investments for speculation or trading purposes and are not a party to financial or commodity derivatives 
we have operated primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenue  cost  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars for accordingly  we do not have material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
