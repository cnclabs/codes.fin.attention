critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables  the fair value of future obligations under financial products contracts and the recoverability of the carrying value of real estate properties 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
executive overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was  million in compared with  million in and million in the increase in net income in was driven by increases in both underwriting and investment income in our property and casualty insurance business 
underwriting results in were adversely affected by pre tax costs of million related to hurricane katrina  including estimated net losses of million and net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million 
we also incurred a charge of about million  included in our corporate segment  representing our share of the losses from hurricane katrina estimated by an insurer in which we have a minority interest 
despite the impact of hurricane katrina  underwriting results were highly profitable in as they were in  compared with modestly profitable results in our combined loss and expense ratio was in both and compared with in premium growth was in and in premiums in our insurance business grew in and in the lower growth in reflects our maintaining underwriting discipline in a more competitive market environment 
rates were generally stable  but were under competitive pressure in some classes of business 
in our reinsurance assumed business  premiums decreased in after increasing in the decrease in was in line with our expectations as we had anticipated fewer attractive opportunities in the reinsurance market 
during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to unfavorable development in the professional liability classes of business  principally errors and omissions liability  and in excess liability and certain other commercial liability classes  offset in part by favorable development in the property classes and in fidelity and surety 
property and casualty investment income after taxes increased by in and in in december  we completed a transaction involving a new reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our continuing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
the transaction resulted in the recognition of a pre tax realized investment gain of million in a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance chubb financial solutions non insurance business corporate and other realized investment gains consolidated income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other charges property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax property and casualty income before tax in was higher than in which  in turn  was substantially higher than in income in and benefited from highly profitable underwriting results 
underwriting income increased modestly in despite significantly higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
results in and also benefited from a significant increase in investment income 
the profitability of the property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both underwriting operations and investments 
we view these as two distinct operations 
the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
change in reporting format the reporting format for property and casualty underwriting results by business unit was changed in to more closely reflect the way the business is now managed 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the new presentation 
the changes to the reporting format are as follows personal insurance valuable articles results  which had been included in other personal  are now included in homeowners 
accident results  which had been included in other specialty  are now included in other personal 
commercial insurance commercial insurance results from our financial institutions business  which had been included in financial institutions results in specialty insurance  are now included in the appropriate commercial insurance lines 
specialty insurance executive protection results are now combined with the professional liability and financial fidelity results from our financial institutions business into a new professional liability line 
financial institutions results are no longer reported separately 
surety results  which had been included in other specialty  are now reported separately within specialty insurance 
reinsurance assumed reinsurance assumed results  which had been included in other specialty  are now reported as a separate business unit 
underwriting results net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of over an increase in premiums from our insurance business was partially offset by a decline in premiums from our reinsurance business 
net premiums written increased in compared with  reflecting increases in premiums from both our insurance and reinsurance businesses 
net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total premiums from our insurance business grew in and in premiums in reflected reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
approximately of our insurance premiums in were written in the united states 
insurance premiums in the us grew by in and in insurance premiums outside the us grew in and in in local currencies  such growth was and in and  respectively  reflecting the weakness of the us dollar 
we experienced modest premium growth in our insurance business in in a more competitive market environment  we maintained underwriting discipline by continuing to get acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on business written 
rates were generally stable  but were under competitive pressure in some classes of business 
we continued to retain a high percentage of our existing customers and to renew these accounts at adequate prices 
in addition  while we continued to be selective  we found opportunities to write new business at acceptable rates 
the premium growth in was largely the result of our retaining a higher percentage of our existing customers compared with the prior year and attracting new customers 
we did get rate increases in on a significant portion of the business we wrote  although the size of such increases decelerated throughout the year 
reinsurance assumed premiums generated by chubb re decreased by in after increasing by in premiums in included net reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
the premium decline in was in line with our expectations 
as discussed below  we sold our ongoing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point limited in december reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies we write that are subject to the reinsurance 
our overall reinsurance costs in were similar to those in we discontinued a casualty per risk treaty that responded primarily to excess liability exposures over million 
underwriting actions we have taken in recent years resulted in a reduction in the number of such exposures  which we believe made this treaty no longer economical 
our professional liability per risk treaty was renewed with coverage similar to the prior year 
on our property per risk treaty  our retention remained at million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention and to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top 
our overall reinsurance costs in were lower than those in we discontinued our professional liability per risk treaty 
underwriting actions we have taken in recent years have resulted in lower average limits on those large risks we write  which we believe made this treaty no longer economical 
on our casualty clash treaty  which operates like a catastrophe treaty  we increased our retention from million to million 
this treaty now provides million of coverage in excess of million per insured event 
we did not renew a high excess surety per risk treaty as we believe the cost was not justified 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  our retention remained at million 
this treaty provides million of coverage per risk in excess of our retention 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase the coverage in the northeastern part of the country by million 
the program now provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion  with additional coverage of of losses between billion and billion in the northeastern part of the country 
our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states was modified to increase our retention from million to million 
this treaty now provides coverage of of losses between million and million 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions for acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists 
since september  we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance 
our reinsurance program has not been finalized 
our casualty clash treaty was extended through march  under its current terms 
our property reinsurance program renews on april as a result of the substantial losses suffered by reinsurers from the catastrophes in the latter half of  we are anticipating significant price increases on our property catastrophe treaties and our commercial property per risk treaty 
the final structure and amount of coverage purchased will be determinants of our cost for these treaties 
in addition  the availability of reinsurance for certain coverages  such as terrorism  will continue to be limited and expensive in profitability underwriting results in and were highly profitable compared with modestly profitable results in the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the loss ratio was modestly higher in than in due to higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
the loss ratio improved in compared with the prior year  reflecting the favorable experience resulting from our disciplined underwriting in recent years as well as substantially lower incurred losses related to asbestos claims 
our estimated net losses from hurricane katrina were million and we incurred million of net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to the hurricane 
in our insurance business  we incurred net losses of million as well as reinstatement premium costs of million  for an aggregate cost of million 
in our reinsurance assumed business  we incurred net losses of million and recognized net reinstatement premium revenue of million  for a net cost of million 
we estimate that our gross losses from hurricane katrina were about billion 
almost all of the losses were from property exposure and business interruption claims 
our net losses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to a property per risk treaty that limited our net loss per risk and our property catastrophe treaty 
we still have about million of reinsurance available for this event under our catastrophe treaty if our gross losses were higher than our current estimate 
therefore  while it is possible that our estimate of ultimate losses related to hurricane katrina may change in the future  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
our total net catastrophe losses in were million and related net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs were million 
the aggregate impact accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
losses from catastrophes were million in  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio  and million or percentage points in the catastrophe loss amount reflects an million reduction in loss reserves related to the september  attack  which reduced the impact of catastrophes on the loss ratio for the year by of a percentage point 
other than the reinsurance recoverable related to hurricane katrina  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during the three year period because there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded our initial retention under the program 
incurred losses related to asbestos claims were million in  million in and million in  which represented  and percentage points  respectively  of the loss ratio 
our expense ratio improved in and again in the lower expense ratio in was due to premiums written growing at a higher rate than overhead expenses  as we made progress in reducing our expense structure  and to lower contingent commission expenses 
the decrease in contingent commissions in was due to two factors that reduced producer compensation 
first  we did not pay contingent commissions in the fourth quarter to those large brokers who elected to terminate such arrangements before year end 
second  the slowdown of premium growth in the second half of the year resulted in lower compensation to other producers whose commissions  in part  were contingent on the volume of business placed with us 
the decrease in the expense ratio in was due to lower contingent commission expenses and  to a lesser extent  flat overhead expenses compared with  as we continued to make progress in reducing our cost structure through outsourcing and other initiatives  and the discontinuation of a professional liability per risk reinsurance treaty  which resulted in an increase in net premiums written without a commensurate increase in expenses 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums from personal insurance  which represented of the premiums written by our property and casualty subsidiaries in  increased by in compared with a increase in net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions automobile homeowners other total personal in both and  premium growth was driven by our homeowners business 
the growth in our homeowners business in both years was due to increased insurance to value and  to a lesser extent  higher rates 
the in force policy count for this class had minimal growth in both years 
homeowners premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
the low growth in our personal automobile business in was due to our maintaining underwriting discipline in a more competitive marketplace 
growth in our other personal business  which includes insurance for excess liability  yacht and accident coverages  was lower in than in the prior year 
this was attributable to lower premiums in our us accident business due to increased competition and the culling of our health care business 
our personal insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
overall results have shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year  driven largely by our homeowners results 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal homeowners results were profitable in each of the last three years and showed significant improvement in and again in the improvement was largely the result of better pricing and a reduction in water damage losses primarily through contract wording changes related to mold damage and loss remediation measures that we have implemented over the past few years 
results in also benefited from lower catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our personal automobile results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in were slightly less profitable than in due to reserve strengthening in the liability component related to prior accident years 
the improvement in was due to lower claim frequency and stable loss severity as well as modest rate increases 
other personal business produced profitable results in each of the past three years 
results in and were less profitable than those in due to higher losses in the excess liability and yacht components in both years 
the yacht losses in were primarily related to catastrophes 
our accident business was profitable in all three years 
commercial insurance net premiums from commercial insurance  which represented of our total writings in  increased by in compared with an increase in net premiums written for the classes of business within the commercial insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial growth in occurred in all segments of this business but was particularly strong in the workers compensation and casualty classes 
the premium growth was due in large part to higher rates as well as an increase in our in force policy count 
however  as expected  the level of rate increases declined throughout as we experienced more competition in the marketplace  particularly in the property classes 
the low growth in was the result of increased competition in the marketplace 
rates decreased slightly in compared with multiple peril and property and marine premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million and million  respectively  related to hurricane katrina 
excluding the reinsurance reinstatement premiums  multiple peril premiums were flat in compared with and property and marine premiums grew 
retention levels of our existing customers were somewhat higher in compared with and remained steady in new business volume has steadily declined since due to decreased submission activity  the result of our competitors working to retain their better accounts 
we have maintained our discipline in the competitive market by continuing to get acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on business written 
it is uncertain how the hurricanes in will affect the commercial insurance marketplace 
we have seen significant price increases and tighter terms and conditions on property business in catastrophe exposed areas 
we expect this trend to continue in however  we expect that property business in non catastrophe exposed areas and casualty business will remain competitive 
our commercial insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the past three years  particularly in these profitable results were due in large part to the cumulative effect of price increases  better terms and conditions and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
results in and also benefited from unusually low non catastrophe property losses 
results in were less profitable than in largely due to higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
results in were adversely affected by incurred losses related to asbestos claims 
incurred losses related to asbestos claims were million in  million in and million in the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial multiple peril results were highly profitable in each of the past three years  but more so in results in were less profitable than in largely due to higher catastrophe losses 
the property component of this business benefited from unusually low non catastrophe losses in both years 
both the property and liability components of this business contributed to the substantial improvement in compared with the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in and percentage points in catastrophe losses were negligible for this class in due to a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
results for our casualty business were profitable in compared with highly profitable results in and unprofitable results in casualty results in each year were adversely affected by asbestos losses  particularly in asbestos losses represented  and percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for casualty business in  and  respectively 
the automobile component of our casualty business was highly profitable in each of the past three years 
excluding the effects of asbestos losses  results in the primary liability component were also highly profitable in each of the past three years while results in the excess liability component were unprofitable in  profitable in and near breakeven in excess liability results in were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to accident years prior to due to significant reported loss activity that caused us to extend the expected loss emergence period 
results in for this component benefited from a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
workers compensation results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results were more profitable in each succeeding year 
results in all three years benefited from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were marginally profitable in compared with highly profitable results in the previous two years  particularly in results in each year benefited from improved pricing  higher deductibles and better terms and conditions 
results in and also benefited from unusually low non catastrophe losses 
results in deteriorated  however  due to substantially higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the impact of catastrophes in reflects a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
specialty insurance net premiums from specialty insurance  which represented of our total writings in  increased by in compared with a increase in net premiums written for the classes of business within the specialty insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions professional liability surety total specialty growth in net premiums written for the professional liability classes of business was constrained in both and by the competitive pressure on rates that began in the latter half of and by our commitment to maintain underwriting discipline 
growth in was also dampened by the sale of renewal rights  effective july   on our hospital medical malpractice and managed care errors and omissions business 
the net premium growth in in the professional liability classes was due solely to the non renewal of a per risk reinsurance treaty 
overall  rates increased slightly in and were down slightly in the most significant rate declines occurred in the for profit directors and officers liability component 
retention levels were significantly higher in compared with  while new business volume was similar to levels 
retention levels in were comparable to the levels  while new business volume was lower due in part to our exiting the hospital medical malpractice and managed care errors and omissions business 
overall  we continued to get adequate rates and favorable terms and conditions on both new business and renewals 
while large public companies remain a significant component of our book of business  that component has decreased in recent years in line with our strategy to focus on small and middle market publicly traded and privately held companies 
the growth in net premiums written for our surety business was substantial in both and the growth in was due in part to the non renewal of a high excess reinsurance treaty 
our specialty insurance business produced modestly profitable underwriting results in compared with unprofitable results in and the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december professional liability surety total specialty our professional liability business improved substantially in  producing near breakeven results compared with the highly unprofitable results in and results have begun to benefit from the cumulative effect of price increases  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions in recent years 
results in all three years  but more so in and  were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to accident years and prior  particularly in the errors and omissions class 
the adverse development was predominantly from claims that have arisen due to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
results were particularly unprofitable in due to an increase of about million in errors and omissions liability loss reserves in the second quarter related to investment banks 
the fidelity component of our professional liability business was highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
our surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
we continue to manage our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
the majority of our obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by the customer s balance sheet  contract proceeds  collateral and bankruptcy recovery 
we continue to have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers 
in that regard  we have exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and liquidity 
reinsurance assumed our reinsurance assumed business is treaty reinsurance  primarily casualty reinsurance 
premiums from our reinsurance assumed business  which represented of our net premiums written in  decreased by in compared with a increase in premiums in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
the significant decrease in premiums in was in line with our expectations as we had anticipated fewer attractive opportunities in the reinsurance market 
our reinsurance assumed business was profitable in  and the combined loss and expense ratio for this business was  and in  and  respectively 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio in and percentage points in catastrophe losses were not significant in transfer of ongoing reinsurance assumed business in december  we completed a transaction involving a new bermuda based reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our continuing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
in exchange  we received from harbor point million of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock of harbor point 
the notes and warrants represent in the aggregate on a fully diluted basis approximately of the new company 
harbor point generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
other than pursuant to certain arrangements entered into with harbor point  we generally will no longer engage directly in the reinsurance assumed business 
however  harbor point will have the right for a transition period of up to two years to underwrite specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we will retain a portion of any such business and will cede the balance to harbor point in return for a fronting commission 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million  of which million was recognized as a realized investment gain in the remaining gain of million was deferred and will be recognized based on the timing of the ultimate disposition of our economic interest in harbor point 
we will receive additional payments over the next two years based on the amount of business renewed by harbor point  which will be recognized as realized investment gains when earned 
regulatory developments to promote and distribute our insurance products  we rely on a large network of independent brokers and agents 
accordingly  our business is dependent on the willingness of these brokers and agents to recommend our products to their customers 
we have agreements in place with insurance brokers under which we agree to pay commissions that are contingent on the volume and or the profitability of business placed with us 
we also have in place contingent commission arrangements with agents who are appointed by us to sell our insurance 
the new york attorney general and other regulators have commenced investigations with respect to potential conflicts of interest and anti competitive behavior arising from the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and agents 
in connection with these investigations  we have received subpoenas and requests for information from the attorneys general of several states  as well as from various states insurance regulators 
we are cooperating  and intend to continue to cooperate  fully with these investigations 
as a result of these investigations  in certain instances  brokers and agents and  in at least one case  a major insurance carrier have entered into settlement agreements with such regulators 
among other things  these agreements prohibit the acceptance or payment  as applicable  of contingent commissions for some or all lines of business 
several other brokers and some agents have voluntarily eliminated the practice of receiving contingent compensation from insurers 
other industry participants may make similar or different determinations in the future 
in addition  a number of states have announced that they are looking at compensation arrangements and considering regulatory action or reform in this area 
the rules that would be imposed if these actions or reforms were adopted range in nature from disclosure requirements to prohibition of certain forms of compensation to imposition of new duties on insurance agents  brokers or carriers in dealing with customers 
these or other developments may require changes to market practices relative to contingent commissions 
changes to the manner in which we interact with and compensate insurance brokers and agents could have a material adverse impact on our ability to renew business or write new business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
certain regulators also have commenced investigations into certain loss mitigation and finite reinsurance arrangements in the property and casualty insurance industry 
in connection with these investigations  we have received subpoenas and requests for information from various regulators including the us securities and exchange commission and the us attorney for the southern district of new york 
we are cooperating  and intend to continue to cooperate  fully with these investigations 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of these investigations or any impact on our business or results of operations 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  winter storms and brush fires and from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
we have invested in modeling technologies and a concentration management tool that allow us to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in such areas in other countries 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage exposure under the insurance policies we issue 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that provides estimates of loss events 
we also have a concentration management tool that enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations 
the information provided by the model and the tracking tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts and has restricted us from writing others 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program  which was applicable to most lines of commercial business  was scheduled to terminate on december  in december  the federal government extended tria through december  under the terms of the amended law  certain lines of business previously subject to the provisions of tria  including commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability  are excluded from the program 
as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
in  the deductible will increase to of direct premiums earned in and the insurer share for losses above the deductible will increase to 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism insurance is mandatory under tria 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  insureds may choose not to accept terrorism insurance  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our reinsurance program  the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include the accumulation of individual case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
our loss reserves include significant amounts related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  hurricane katrina and the september attack 
the components of our loss reserves were as follows december in millions gross loss reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to hurricane katrina related to september attack all other loss reserves reinsurance recoverable related to asbestos and toxic waste claims related to hurricane katrina related to september attack all other reinsurance recoverable net loss reserves loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by billion or in compared with an increase of billion or in the loss reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  hurricane katrina and the september attack are significant components of our total loss reserves  but they distort the growth trend in the loss reserves 
excluding such loss reserves  our loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by billion or in compared with an increase of billion or in the components of our net loss reserves were as follows december in millions reserves related to asbestos and toxic waste claims reserves related to hurricane katrina reserves related to september attack all other loss reserves personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance reinsurance assumed net loss reserves loss reserves for each of our business units increased significantly in and again in the most significant increases occurred in the long tail liability classes of business within commercial and specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos claims and  to a lesser extent  toxic waste claims  it is possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may increase in future periods 
such increases in estimates could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s future operating results 
however  management does not expect that any such increases would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
due to the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly when settlements may not occur until well into the future 
a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s operating results 
for example  a hypothetical increase in net loss reserves at december  would have resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
typically  there is less variability in reserve estimates for these classes of business 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial excess liability  and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
in addition  liability claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tailed casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 
we regularly review the loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write as part of our overall analysis of loss reserves  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
to estimate loss reserves  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
these methods generally utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year by class of business 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
for certain long tail classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns  estimates are based on both expected losses and actual reported losses 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  we judgmentally set an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year based on our evaluation of loss trends and the current risk environment 
the estimate of ultimate losses is adjusted as the accident years mature 
in completing their actuarial reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions  including the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors 
they are also required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods can also change over time 
the estimation methods chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
in most cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the loss reserves being evaluated 
this will result in a number of point estimates for each class of business 
using all available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amount for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate liability is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated liability  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
after carefully reviewing our actuaries loss reserve analyses  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is often not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions including the impact of the class action fairness act of  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues can have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include increases in the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance  exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances and increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to remediation of mold conditions 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the future impact of the various factors described above that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process and of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and cannot be quantified 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
it is therefore not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and toxic waste claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims 
such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations as well as changes in applicable legislation 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance companies over many years and increases their exposure to liability 
new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
each claim filing typically names dozens of defendants to ensure that there is a solvent company left in the group to eventually pay claims 
the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims are filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
there have been several recent positive events in the asbestos environment various challenges to mass screening claimants have been mounted  including a june us district court decision in texas that accused plaintiffs lawyers of filing claims for people who had not been properly diagnosed with silicosis 
among the repercussions of that ruling  several asbestos injury settlement trusts have refused new claims that were based on the diagnosis of physicians or screening companies named in the case 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
since  several states have enacted laws that set medical criteria that must be met for plaintiffs to proceed with their claims 
other states have medical criteria bills pending 
while this legislation is being challenged in certain of these states  it appears that these laws are already impacting the filing of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs 
a related positive development has been the implementation by several states of inactive dockets  which preserve the rights of unimpaired claimants but do not provide for payments to these claimants unless they meet medical criteria 
to date  approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
certain of these manufacturers and distributors have utilized a practice referred to as a prepackaged bankruptcy  which involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in recognition that many aspects of prepackaged bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are beginning to be closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
therefore  the future impact of such efforts on insurers is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
proposed legislation currently being considered by the senate would create a billion asbestos trust fund 
we are among those who oppose this bill because it provides neither certainty nor finality 
in the fourth quarter of  our actuaries and claim personnel  together with our outside actuarial consultants  performed a rigorous update of a ground up analysis of our asbestos related exposures 
the review noted certain adverse trends  particularly an increase in estimates of the ultimate liabilities for several of our traditional asbestos defendants 
in addition  the number of peripheral asbestos defendants for whom we established reserves and the average severity of these claims were both higher than anticipated 
upon completion of the update  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million 
during and  our actuaries and claim personnel performed analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analysis noted that both the number of peripheral asbestos defendants for whom we established reserves and the average severity of these claims were again somewhat higher than expected 
in addition  there was an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for one of our traditional asbestos defendants 
the analysis noted an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for two of our asbestos defendants 
based on these analyses  which were confirmed by our outside actuarial consultants  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in and million in the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year the following table presents the number of policyholders for whom we have open asbestos case reserves and the related net loss reserves at december  as well as the net losses paid during by component 
number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs increased focus on peripheral defendants  the increase in the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities and the impact of prepackaged bankruptcies  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
while there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos arena over the past two years  it is too early to call it a trend 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a hazardous waste site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
the prps disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically excluded such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we are seeing cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  judicial interpretations  past settlement values of similar exposures as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to toxic waste claims 
however  toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to more efficient site remediation efforts 
in other cases  we have been successful at buying back our policies 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
there are virtually no reinsurance recoveries related to these claims 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year of the net toxic waste loss reserves at december  million was for ibnr losses 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers with strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on an evaluation of balances due from reinsurers  changes in the credit standing of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall unfavorable prior year development of million  which represented of the net loss reserves as of december  this compares with unfavorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december   and million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december  such adverse development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the net unfavorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant were we experienced net adverse development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
adverse development related to accident years through  due largely to errors and omissions liability claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities  was offset in part by favorable development related to accident years and we experienced adverse development of about million related to accident years prior to  including million related to asbestos claims 
the adverse development was due largely to our strengthening loss reserves for commercial excess umbrella and other commercial liability classes 
there was significant reported loss activity during related to these older accident years  which caused us to extend the expected loss emergence period for these classes 
we experienced favorable development of about million due to fewer than expected late reported homeowners and commercial property losses 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity and surety classes due to lower than expected reported loss emergence 
the net unfavorable development of million in was also the result of various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced adverse development of about million in the professional liability classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  resulting from adverse loss trends in accident years through due in large part to claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities  especially those involving investment banks and other financial institutions 
we experienced adverse development of about million related to accident years prior to  including million related to asbestos claims 
we strengthened loss reserves for certain commercial liability classes 
we experienced adverse development of about million in the workers compensation class due primarily to higher average severity of the medical portion of these claims 
we experienced favorable development of about million related to the accident year  due in large part to an unusually low amount of late reported homeowners and commercial property losses 
we experienced favorable development of million due to a reduction of loss reserves related to the september attack 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to two factors 
first  we strengthened asbestos loss reserves by million in the fourth quarter 
second  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in our professional liability classes  principally directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability  as adverse loss trends in the through accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in older accident years 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in compared with and by in compared with growth in both years was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
growth in also benefited from an million capital contribution to the property and casualty subsidiaries by the corporation in the second quarter of growth in investment income in both years was dampened by lower available reinvestment rates on fixed maturities that matured 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuated as the result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during each year 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
other charges other charges include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
other charges in included expenses of million related to the restructuring of our operations in continental europe 
the restructuring costs consisted primarily of severance costs related to branch closings and work force reductions 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs was organized in to develop and provide customized products to address specific financial needs of corporate clients 
cfs operated through both the capital and insurance markets 
the insurance and reinsurance solutions were written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  and the results of such business are included within our underwriting results 
in april  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s non insurance business and to run off the existing financial products portfolio 
since that date  our objective has been to exit this business as quickly as possible while minimizing the potential of a large payment due to an unexpected credit event 
cfs s non insurance business was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
the corporation guaranteed all of these obligations 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  cfs participated in the senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of corporate or asset backed securities 
the structure of these portfolio credit default swaps generally requires cfs to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to numerous credit events  exceed a specified threshold 
the risk below that threshold  referred to as subordination  is assumed by other parties with the primary risk layer sometimes retained by the buyer 
credit events generally arise when one of the referenced entities within a portfolio becomes bankrupt  undergoes a debt restructuring or fails to make timely interest or principal payments 
portfolio credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit our positions 
credit default swaps tend to be unique transactions and there is no market for trading such exposures 
to estimate the fair value of the obligation in each credit default swap  we use internal valuation models that are similar to external valuation models 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in credit spreads  the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
thus  cfs s results have been subject to volatility 
the non insurance business of cfs produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in the substantial loss in was due to downgrades in the financial ratings of certain referenced securities underlying two of our asset backed portfolio credit default swaps 
in the first nine months of the year  the fair value of our obligations related to these two swaps increased by million 
then  in the fourth quarter  cfs paid million to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps and simultaneously entered into a new contract under which cfs guaranteed principal and interest obligations on a notional amount of referenced securities 
cfs established a liability of million related to the new principal and interest contract  which represented the estimated fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
at the same time  cfs eliminated the carried liability of million on the two swaps that were terminated 
the aggregate loss in the fourth quarter related to the termination of the two swaps was million 
the losses during related to these two asset backed swaps were partially offset by mark to market gains on our corporate credit default swaps 
the loss in was primarily related to the termination during the year of cfs s obligations under several portfolio credit default swaps 
the loss in was due to the termination of the principal and interest guarantee contract 
cfs paid the counterparty million to terminate the contract  at which time the million liability was eliminated 
the loss related to the termination of this contract was partially offset by gains on the termination during the period of cfs s obligations under certain portfolio credit default swaps 
revenues from the non insurance business of cfs  primarily consisting of the change in fair value of derivatives contracts  were virtually nil in and and negative million in revenues were negative in due to the adverse impact of changes in fair value and the impact of the agreement to terminate the two asset backed portfolio credit default swaps and replace them with a principal and interest guarantee 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its in force portfolio credit default swaps is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
during each of the past three years  cfs terminated certain portfolio credit default swaps with the original counterparties at negotiated settlement amounts 
cfs also entered into credit default swaps with third parties that effectively offset existing credit default swaps 
as of december   the notional amount of such offsetting credit default swaps was approximately billion 
the notional amount of cfs s credit default swaps was billion at december  our realistic loss exposure is a very small portion of the billion notional amount as our position is senior to subordinated interests of million in the aggregate 
in addition  using our internal ratings models  we estimate that the credit ratings of the individual portfolio credit default swaps at december  were aaa 
in addition to portfolio credit default swaps  cfs entered into a derivative contract linked to an equity market index that terminates in and a few other insignificant non insurance transactions 
the notional amount and fair value of our future obligations under derivative contracts by type of risk were as follows december notional amount fair value in billions in millions credit default swaps corporate securities asset backed securities other corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
it also includes income from our investment in allied world assurance company  ltd 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
corporate and other results were similar in all three years as increases in investment income in and were substantially offset by increasingly larger losses in our real estate operations 
investment income was higher in compared with due to an increase in corporate invested assets resulting primarily from the issuance of common stock under stock based employee compensation plans 
investment income was higher in compared with due to an increase in corporate invested assets resulting primarily from the issuance of debt and equity securities during in and  corporate and other results included a loss at the chubb institute  inc  the post secondary educational subsidiary that we sold in september in both years  the effect of this loss was substantially offset by income from our investment in allied world 
income from our investment in allied world was significantly lower in than in the prior two years due to losses from hurricane katrina  our share of which was approximately million 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in these amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
during  we committed to a plan to sell a parcel of land in new jersey that we had previously intended to hold and develop 
the decision to sell the property was based on our assessment of the current real estate market and our concern about zoning issues 
as a result of our decision to sell this property  we reassessed the recoverability of its carrying value 
based on our reassessment  we recognized an impairment loss of million during the year to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
the higher loss in compared with was due primarily to the recognition of impairment losses in on two commercial properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
in addition to the aforementioned parcel of land that we plan to sell  we own approximately million of land that we expect will be developed in the future 
our real estate assets also include approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets  other than the parcel of land that we plan to sell  is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect future improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed or if leased properties do not perform as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized that would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
realized investment gains and losses net investment gains realized were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses on sales equity securities fixed maturities transfer of reinsurance assumed business personal lines insurance brokerage chubb institute other than temporary impairment equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax of the net realized gains on sales of equity securities  million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our share of gains recognized by limited partnerships in which we have an interest 
in december  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance business and certain related assets to harbor point limited 
we recognized a gain of million on this transaction  which is further discussed under transfer of ongoing reinsurance assumed business 
in september  we completed the sale of personal lines insurance brokerage  inc based on the terms of the sale  we recognized a gain of million 
in  we sold the chubb institute 
under the terms of the sale  we recognized a loss of million 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
in the fourth quarter of  to reduce our income tax liability  we engaged in a program to sell taxable and tax exempt fixed maturities to generate realized losses to offset a portion of the gain related to the harbor point transaction 
we regularly review those invested assets whose fair value is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
in evaluating whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider various quantitative criteria and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost  general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
the writedowns of fixed maturities in were primarily due to collateral deterioration of several asset backed securities and price declines of a few corporate credits in the airline and energy sectors 
information related to investment securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and is included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we establish deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
similarly  we establish deferred tax assets related to the expected future us tax benefit of losses and foreign taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
to evaluate the realization of the future tax benefit of these deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated 
management s judgment is based on its assessment of business plans and related projections of future taxable income as well as available tax planning strategies 
the tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits have no expiration 
however  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to consider a relatively near term horizon when we evaluate the likelihood of realizing future tax benefits 
during the years through  chubb insurance company of europe chubb europe incurred substantial losses 
during  we established a valuation allowance of million for the portion of deferred income tax assets related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe that we could not recognize for accounting purposes due to the requirement to evaluate realization over a near term horizon 
due to profitable results in chubb europe during  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized over a near term horizon and we eliminated the valuation allowance 
in connection with the sale of a subsidiary a number of years ago  we agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain pre closing tax liabilities 
during the first quarter of  we settled this obligation with the purchaser 
as a result  we reduced our income tax liability  which resulted in the recognition of a benefit of million 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of the corporation and its ability to generate cash flows from its operating subsidiaries  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
in  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million mandatorily exercisable warrants to purchase its common stock 
the notes and warrants were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represented principal amount of notes and one warrant 
in august  the notes were successfully remarketed as required by their terms 
the interest rate on the notes was reset to  effective august  the remarketed notes mature on november  each warrant obligated the holder to purchase  on or before november   for a settlement price of  a variable number of shares of chubb s common stock 
the number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the market price of chubb s common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of the common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the warrants  chubb issued  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million 
in june  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million purchase contracts to purchase its common stock 
the notes and purchase contracts were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represents principal amount of notes and one purchase contract 
the notes will be remarketed in may each purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase  for a settlement price of  a variable number of shares of chubb s common stock on or before august  the number of shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the market price of chubb s common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of the common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the purchase contracts  chubb will receive proceeds of approximately million and will issue between approximately  and  shares of common stock 
the equity units are further described in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
chubb also has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured debentures due in and million of unsecured debentures due in in august  million of notes were paid when due 
chubb executive risk inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in executive risk capital trust  wholly owned by chubb executive risk  has outstanding million of capital securities 
the sole assets of the trust are debentures issued by chubb executive risk 
the capital securities are subject to mandatory redemption in upon repayment of the debentures 
the capital securities are also subject to mandatory redemption under certain circumstances beginning in chubb has guaranteed the unsecured notes and the capital securities 
management continuously monitors the amount of capital resources that chubb maintains both for itself and its operating subsidiaries 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy its capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
in june  a shelf registration statement that chubb filed in march was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  up to billion of various types of securities may be issued 
at december   approximately million remained under the shelf registration statement 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of chubb s common stock 
the authorization has no expiration date 
the authorization replaced an existing program authorized by the board in july to purchase up to  shares  of which  shares had remained available 
we made no share repurchases during and we repurchased  shares in open market transactions in at a cost of million 
as of december    shares remained under the current share repurchase authorization 
based on our outlook for  we expect to repurchase all of the shares remaining under this authorization by the end of on january   we repurchased  shares under an accelerated stock buyback program at an initial price of per share  for a total cost of approximately million 
at the end of the program  we may receive  or be required to pay  a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of chubb s common stock during the agreed upon program period  which will not exceed four months 
the price adjustment may be settled  at our election  in chubb s common stock or cash 
ratings chubb and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
credit ratings assess a company s ability to repay its debts 
the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt rating aa a a a commercial paper amb a p f financial strength ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders 
the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that positive or negative ratings actions by one or more of the rating agencies may occur in the future 
if our ratings were downgraded  we may incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
in addition  a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
our strong underwriting results continued to generate substantial new cash in new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately billion in compared with billion in and billion in new cash available in was lower than in due to a increase in paid losses in whereas premium receipts were only modestly higher compared with the increase in paid losses in was due primarily to directors and officers liability payments related to accident years and prior  payments related to hurricane katrina and payments related to two surety claims 
new cash available in was higher than in due to growth in premium receipts in whereas paid losses were nearly flat compared with in addition to cash from operations  the property and casualty subsidiaries received a capital contribution of million from chubb in the second quarter of our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities to provide for immediate cash needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by dividends from its property and casualty subsidiaries and the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
it is expected that our liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds or borrowings from our credit facility 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its obligations  including the payment of interest and principal on debt obligations  relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
various state insurance laws restrict our property and casualty subsidiaries as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  these subsidiaries paid to chubb dividends totaling million  including million in cash and million in other assets 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during without prior approval is approximately billion 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
in june  the corporation entered into a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to million 
the revolving credit facility terminates on june  on the termination date of the agreement  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
various interest rate options are available to the corporation  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants including a covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated shareholders equity  as adjusted 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
this facility replaced a million short term revolving credit facility that expired and a million medium term revolving credit facility that was terminated 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and there after total in millions principal due under long term debt interest and contract adjustment payments on long term debt and equity units future minimum rental payments under operating leases total the above table excludes certain commitments totaling billion at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnerships during the commitment period on average  to years to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
the above table also excludes estimated future cash flows related to our carried loss reserves at december  there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of future events 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses was billion at december  of this billion liability  we estimate that approximately billion will be paid in  an aggregate billion will be paid in and  and an aggregate billion will be paid in and the estimate is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely vary materially from our estimate 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the corporation does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  except as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury and government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues as well as foreign bonds that support our international operations 
in addition  the portfolio includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks and private equity limited partnerships  held with the objective of capital appreciation 
in  and  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and taxable bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in  the taxable bonds we invested in were primarily mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
in  the taxable bonds were primarily us treasury securities  foreign government bonds and corporate bonds 
in  the taxable bonds were primarily us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities and foreign government bonds 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and fixed maturity securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december  and  of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the unrealized appreciation before tax of investments carried at market value  which includes fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was million  million and  million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns

we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
about of the taxable bonds in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  about are rated aa or better with about rated aaa 
about of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected  aaa rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments generally have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling euro equity price risk is the potential loss in market value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
our portfolio also includes investments in private equity limited partnerships 
these investments by their nature are less liquid and involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our market risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
we do extensive research and due diligence prior to investing 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
debt we also have interest rate risk on our debt obligations
