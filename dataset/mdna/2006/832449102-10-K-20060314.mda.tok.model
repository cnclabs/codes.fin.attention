summary smithtown bancorp  inc  is a holding company formed in  engaged primarily in commercial banking through its wholly owned subsidiary  bank of smithtown 
the bank offers a full array of consumer and commercial deposit and lending products and services through its thirteen branch offices and its online banking site 
the bank also provides insurance and financial products through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc and bank of smithtown financial services  inc for the following discussion  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company and the bank and its subsidiaries are referred to as the bank 
there were several significant factors that affected the company s financial condition and results of operations during the discussion of these factors should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
the company s earnings per share for was as compared to for  an increase of 
as the weighted average number of outstanding shares only decreased by  shares from to  this increase in earnings per share is almost exclusively the result of increased earnings 
the growth in earnings was primarily the result of an increased loan volume of  or 
loan growth was typically slower during the first quarter of the year  characteristic of one of the primary types of lending engaged in by the bank 
as inclement winter weather tends to slow the construction industry  net loan growth was only  for the first three months of the year 
customer refinancings with other banks also remained at a high level during the first quarter of which contributed to the slower growth in the portfolio 
during the second quarter of the year  construction returned to its prior high level  and the bank s net loan growth significantly increased by  this level of growth was maintained during the remainder of the year with an additional increase of  due to the short term nature of construction loans  originations required to sustain this high growth are nearly triple the net growth 
construction projects are typically completed in a nine to twelve month period  at which point the loan is paid and permanent financing is required 
the company s results of operations can be significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly its ability to increase loan volume through construction lending if market interest rates continue to rise 
as this segment of the bank s loan portfolio must be replaced every nine to twelve months  if the construction industry were to slow due to rising interest rates  bank originations could be significantly reduced 
in order to mitigate this risk  the bank has begun increasing its volume of longer term  permanent real estate financing 
the highly competitive nature of this business is another significant factor that could potentially affect the company s results of operations 
as a lower rate of interest may need to be accepted for this type of credit due to strong competitive bidding  the bank s net interest margin could be further reduced 
during  the bank s margin decreased from to 
as compared to its peers  this decrease was small  and in fact was entirely sustained during the first quarter of the year 
each quarter thereafter  net interest margin actually increased from at march to at december  overall  the increasing rate environment of was beneficial to the bank s increasing loan volume  as the average monthly yield on the portfolio increased from for january to for december 
average yield on loans for the year was during as compared to during significant loan growth was achieved during with no compromise to strict underwriting standards or high asset quality 
these achievements were witnessed by the continued low level of nonperforming loans and minimal net charge offs 
nonperforming loans at year end and were and one loan which was internally classified by management during is now in the through day past due category 
this  loan consists of a leasehold mortgage on property on madison avenue in new york city that is appraised at  although the loan remains a concern to management  improvements in cash flow  delinquency and technical issues are expected during during  the positive impact on earnings from the growth in the loan portfolio was partially due to the bank s ability to provide most of the lower cost funding for these loans through internally generated deposits 
wholesale borrowings were required only at year end 
as loan growth was very strong during the fourth quarter and deposit runoff typical at year end was repeated  the bank turned to the wholesale market to fund the new loan originations 
during deposits grew by  or 
the bank was able to achieve this record growth through various channels  one of which was through its three newest branch offices 
 of this total growth was originated at the miller place  motor parkway and port washington branches 
deposit growth  similar to loan growth  is also affected by external interest rate movements and strong competitive pressures 
both of these factors played an important role in the company s results of operations during of the total deposit growth of  demand deposits grew by only  or  money market accounts by  or and time deposits by  or 
now accounts and savings accounts decreased in volume by  or 
the bank ran several time deposit promotions during the year in an effort to provide some of the additional funding for the projected loan growth 
the timing of the acquisition of these deposits was primarily during the first quarter 
it was this  increase in time deposits that was largely responsible for the basis point decline in net interest margin during the first quarter 
although these time deposits resulted in compression of the bank s interest margin  management was still able to provide this funding at rates lower than federal home loan bank advance rates 
due to increasing market rates  the margin compression that could have negatively impacted the bank s net income for the remainder of the year was actually mitigated by maturing long term certificates of deposit that were renewed and repriced at lower rates 
the record growth in deposits during was also achieved through the introduction of the elite money market account in february 
this account provides high rates of interest for balances over thousand 
as liquidity is demanded by consumers during a rising rate environment  this product was very successful in attracting new deposits  and also served as a source of funding that was at a lower cost than the rate offered for comparable borrowings 
growth in demand deposits was small by comparison to time deposits and money markets and was the only deposit goal set by management that was not achieved 
competitive pressures for a commodity product have been and remain extremely strong 
free checking is commonplace to all banks  and the driver for consumer movement of a checking account from one institution to another is often beyond the control of the acquiring bank 
demand deposit growth remains one of the bank s largest challenges for with economic conditions remaining positive in both the long island and the metropolitan area marketplace  and the building industry continuing to prosper  the company s outlook for continued asset growth is positive 
the liability side of the balance sheet  particularly the sources for funding this asset growth  remains the company s greatest challenge 
growth in the bank s investment portfolio also tempered margin compression during as the timing of growth in the loan portfolio and deposit portfolio were not always perfectly matched  deposited funds were invested in short term us government agency securities and municipal securities  offering a higher than federal funds rate of interest 
a total of  in new securities were purchased during  comprised of  of us government agency securities   of mortgage backed securities and  of municipal securities 
the weighted average maturity of these purchased securities was years 
these securities also provided the bank with the collateral necessary for acceptance of local municipal deposits 
was another successful year for the company  with record earnings for the eleventh consecutive year 
return on equity was  the ninth consecutive year for a return to shareholders over 
however  significant challenges lie ahead for the company 
growth in deposits  particularly demand deposits  will remain difficult 
with slower demand deposit growth  and free checking accounts as the most popular demand vehicle  maintaining fee income from service charges becomes difficult 
interest bearing deposit acquisition  while not as difficult to achieve as demand deposit acquisition  can place extreme pressure on net interest margin 
based on the uncertainty of actions to be taken by the new federal reserve chairman during  any further rate increases could have a material impact on the cost for these deposits 
as longer term borrowings mature during the coming years  the rates at which they are renewed could be significantly higher than the current rates paid 
the current weighted average rate on all long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank is with a weighted average term of twenty seven months 
the average rate offered by the federal home loan bank in january for twenty four month borrowings is 
this uncertainty in forward interest rates  as well as the unusual yield curve  places additional pressures on net income 
the company continues to meet these challenges in various ways  one of which is by expanding its franchise 
two new branch offices were opened during plans for the opening of two additional branch offices in plus three new offices in continue to increase the geographical footprint of the company 
development of new products to increase fee income also assists in maintaining strong earnings despite the preponderance of free checking 
the overdraft honor program was very successful toward this effort during this product provides the consumer with coverage of overdrafts up to a predetermined level  yet provides the bank with significant dollars of new fee income 
the third way of meeting these challenges has been and will continue to be through strong asset liability management  with interest rate modeling and other analytical tools to ensure profit maximization within acceptable limits of risk 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that management s estimate needs to be adjusted based on  among other things  additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances  such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact  either positively or negatively  the bank s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management  through its asset quality committee  comprised of several members of executive management as well as the chief collection officer  evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
adjustments are made at this time to a level deemed adequate by the committee  based on its risk evaluation of the portfolio in its entirety as well as in specific loan details 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions  and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of sfas statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas statement no 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
assumptions and judgments also are used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
in addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired  management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed 
statistical information regarding the bank s historical loss experience over a period of time believed to be relevant is weighted very heavily in management s estimate of such losses 
however  future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past 
in addition  management also considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the amount of weight to assign to each in estimating losses 
the factors include  among others  national and local economic conditions  environmental risks  trends in volume and terms of loans  concentrations of credit  changes in lending policies and procedures  and experience  ability  and depth of the bank s lending staff 
because of the nature of the factors and the difficulty in assessing their impact  management s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect actual losses in the portfolio 
although the allowance for loan losses has two separate components  one for impairment losses on individual loans and one for collective impairment losses on pools of loans  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb realized losses as they occur whether they relate to individual loans or pools of loans 
at december   management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established and maintained at a level adequate to reflect the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers  and to access unanticipated earnings enhancement opportunities for company growth 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
due to regulatory restrictions  dividends from the bank to the company at december  were limited to  which represented the bank s retained net income and the net undivided profits from the previous two years 
the dividends received from the bank are used primarily for dividends to the shareholders  and also for interest payments on the subordinated debt 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank  and growth in core deposits 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
the goal of asset liability management is the combination of maintaining adequate liquidity levels without sacrificing earnings 
the bank s objective in asset liability management is to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities in a way that takes advantage of the current and anticipated rate environment 
asset liability management is a primary function of management and is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
the chief executive officer  all executive vice presidents  the vice president of retail and the comptroller serve on the asset liability management committee 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  in recent years  various sources of funding have become available to the bank  in increasing magnitudes 
these additional sources may be more attractive to the bank at different times based on market interest rates and other competitive factors 
during the fourth quarter of competitive pricing of deposits was often irrational and actually higher than the rates available through wholesale funding 
at that point  management made the decision to use this wholesale funding to temporarily fund new loan originations 
management views all sources of funding as acceptable  and makes decisions as to which sources are more advantageous at the time of need 
the discriminate use of different sources of funding at different points in time has contributed to higher interest margins and overall net income for the bank during and at december  the bank had the ability to borrow on aggregate  unsecured lines of credit of  with unaffiliated correspondent banks 
none of this credit was outstanding at year end  and therefore all  was available for use 
the bank has the ability  as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the bank 
at december    of these funds was available yet for borrowing 
at yearend  due to the combination of strong loan growth and deposit runoff typical for the bank at this time of the year  borrowings reached their highest point for the entire year and amounted to  this level was completely within the guidelines of safety and soundness 
as has also been typical for the company in prior years  the level of deposits from december  to january  increased by  and the level of borrowings decreased significantly 
the following table represents management s expectations regarding the estimated cash flow of interest bearing assets and liabilities as of december  this table has been derived based on internal data and management s assumptions  and not necessarily the contractual terms for repayment or redemption 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  changes in market interest rates that are not matched by the company  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
therefore  this information does not reflect the effect of repricing rights or the impact of repricing on interest income or expense 
the following significant assumptions were used in developing the following tables a 
time deposits reflect contractual maturities  b 
money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  all accounts have been included as withdrawable within the first two years and c 
savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive to withdrawal as money market accounts so a significant percentage of these accounts are reflected in the more than to years category 
these assumptions are based on management s historical analysis of market interest rates and levels of the company s deposits over the past ten years

net interest income  the primary contributor to earnings  represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
as has been discussed in prior sections  the bank s net interest margin decreased by eight basis points during  resulting primarily from the increased cost of time deposits and money market accounts  as well as borrowings 
the bank has been able to take advantage of the increasing interest rate environment by repricing its loan portfolio to higher rates 
of the bank s loan portfolio is immediately repriceable and tied to the prime rate 
of the real estate portfolio is adjustable and tied to various us treasury rates 
the upward repricing of these loans has mitigated the pressure placed on margin by the higher cost of interest bearing deposits 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average consolidated statements of financial condition and its consolidated statements of income for the years indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
interest income on investment securities is shown on a tax equivalent basis 
yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from daily average balances and include non performing loans  if any 
the yields and costs include fees  which are considered adjustments to yields

the following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes  which are not due solely to volume or rate changes  have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate 
due to the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the period analyzed  it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates 
in addition  average earning assets include non accrual loans if any

net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or from to as can be seen from the above table  this was due to a combination of an increased volume variance of  and increased interest rate variance of  variances in volume during  the average volume of investment securities increased by  as excess funds collected early in the year were employed in securities yielding a higher rate of interest than federal funds 
a majority of these new securities were us government agency securities with maturities of less than five years 
the largest increase in the company s balance sheet was in the loan portfolio 
this average balance increased from to by  within the loan portfolio  the greatest increase was in real estate loans  which grew by over  in average balances 
within the real estate portfolio  loans to finance land acquisition and construction loans increased by the greatest percentages 
commercial mortgages decreased slightly in volume due to refinancing activity  to limitations placed upon the bank relative to legal lending limits  and to intense competitive pricing pressures 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  average interest earning deposit volume increased by  or 
the greatest increase within deposit balances was in time deposits 
the bank ran several certificate of deposit promotions throughout the year  at rates lower than comparable federal home loan bank advance rates  and was very successful in attracting new customers 
these accounts as well as elite money market accounts were the primary drivers of deposit acquisition during the addition of the three newest branch offices also significantly increased the breadth of the bank s customer base 
the average balance increase in demand deposits for was  or 
while not as strong an increase as management would like to have seen this year  demand deposit acquisition and retention will become a priority goal during the bank s use of borrowed funds  primarily in the form of term advances from the federal home loan bank  increased during by  twenty million dollars of borrowings were originated during the last two months of  as the pricing of interest bearing deposits was very high 
at that point in time  management made the decision to turn to the wholesale markets for loan funding rather than pay the higher rates on deposit accounts 
these additional borrowings at yearend were responsible for the increased average balances of throughout the majority of the bank relied on its own internal deposit generation to fund new loan originations 
stockholder s equity increased during as a result of strong earnings  and this growth resulted in a very strong return on average equity of 
variances in rate the increase in short term interest rates resulting from eight federal reserve bank rate increases during was responsible for the upward movement in rate variance 
a majority of the bank s loan portfolio is adjustable with indexed to the prime rate 
these immediately repriceable loans were in large part responsible for the increase in yield of basis points on the portfolio during investment yields did not fare as well  as new purchases added to the portfolio carried lower yields than currently held securities 
these new purchases were predominantly short term issues  as term extension carried no benefit in the flat yield curve environment of the average yield on federal funds sold increased by basis points over the corresponding yield in this large increase in average yield in combination with a smaller increase in average balances produced a increase in income 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets increased by during costs for deposits also increased  with the largest increase in interest on money market accounts 
this was due to the elite money market account which bears a high rate of interest for balances of  or more 
the product was very successful in attracting additional deposits 
although there was some cannibalization from lower paying money market accounts and savings accounts  overall the balances raised from the product were new funds to the bank  and were lower cost than overnight borrowings and short term advances 
the increase in average cost of deposit accounts was basis points from to the average rate on borrowings also increased during by basis points 
the addition of four advances from the federal home loan bank totaling twenty million dollars at year end was responsible for this increase 
the total increase in interest expense for the company s subordinated debt was due to the increase in average rate 
this increase amounted to basis points for the year over the total effect of the increases in average rates and volumes during was increased net interest income and slightly decreased net interest margin  due primarily to the significant growth in the bank s loan portfolio 
for vs 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or from to as can be seen from the above table  this is due to a combination of an increased volume variance of  and decreased interest rate variance of  variances in volume average balances of investment securities decreased in volume from to as  in securities with call features were redeemed by the issuers  and  of available for sale securities were sold in order to re invest these funds into higher yielding loans 
the average balance of loans increased by  or from year end to year end the increase in the portfolio was predominantly in real estate loans  which increased in average balance by 
commercial and industrial loans increased by a lesser amount in average balance of 
federal funds sold increased significantly in average balance from to this was the result of the mismatch in timing of new deposit acquisition and new loan originations 
a large volume of new deposits were collected during the first half of  but new loan originations were much stronger during the last half of the year 
average deposit balances grew significantly during  with the greatest increase in time deposits 
the average balance of time deposits represented of the total deposit portfolio at december   as compared to at december  money market accounts also grew from to the average balance of these deposits increased by from yearend to yearend other borrowings increased in average balance from  to  from december  to the same date in variances in rate net interest margin decreased from in to in  due to a combination of factors 
on the asset side of the balance sheet  loan yields decreased from to  due to a high level of refinancings  which were replaced by loans carrying lower rates of interest 
the yield on investment securities decreased from to resulting from the sale of higher yielding securities also replaced with lower yielding instruments 
the total yield on interest earning assets declined from to 
interest expense on deposit accounts increased by from to  due to the slight increase in rate from to and the large increase in volume of time deposits and money market accounts 
the rate paid for wholesale borrowings decreased by forty basis points during the rate paid for the subordinated debt also decreased by twenty three basis points in the increased expense for this debt during was due to the full year of outstanding balance as compared to three months of balance in loans the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by residential and commercial properties located within the bank s market area as well as within the five boroughs of new york city 
loan growth remained strong during the portfolio grew by  over the level  representing an increase of 
the largest area of growth during was in land and construction loans 
these loans typically provide the interim financing needs of builders during the construction stage of their project 
the second largest area of growth in the portfolio was in the commercial real estate sector 
these loans are of a longer term nature  and represent the permanent financing needs after construction is complete 
these two segments of the bank s loan portfolio grew in total by  or 
real estate lending continued to be the bank s primary focus and strength for and will be for the coming year 
the bank s experience as to strong performance  low delinquencies  and minimal charge offs provide the basis for continuation in real estate lending 
this can be seen from the segmentation of the portfolio which remained stable from to  with real estate loans comprising and  respectively 
concentration risk is mitigated by geographical and industry diversification  as well as sound  conservative underwriting standards and periodic credit review performed by a prior regulatory examiner 
the following table sets forth the major classifications of loans real estate loans  construction      real estate loans  other commercial      residential      agricultural commercial and industrial loans      loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures      all other loans including overdrafts total loans      total non performing loans at december  and were and loans past due days at these same points in time were  and  respectively 
the  of past due loans this yearend is comprised of two loans  one of which although not past due last year end  was internally classified by management 
this  loan has been in delinquent status since the end of the first quarter of this property is two adjacent six story office buildings located on madison avenue in new york city  and was last appraised at  the bank holds a collateral interest in a leasehold mortgage on these buildings 
the landlord remains in technical default under his lease 
currently  the bank has begun efforts to cure the defaults using funds that are in escrow in the bank 
the borrower has been cooperative with the bank with respect to loan payments  and although in the short term payment difficulties may continue  management fully expects the loan to be substantially improved during last year end this same borrower was the principal in two additional new york city properties for which the bank held mortgages 
both of these properties were sold during with no loss to the bank 
the second loan included in the  of past due loans is a commercial loan for and as of the date of this report has become current 
the remaining in this category represents checking account overdrafts past due more than days 
total internally classified loans  made up of non performing and past due loans as well as loans which management deems to be potentially troublesome at december  and amounted to  and  respectively  the majority of which has been the  loan discussed above 
management expects satisfactory resolution of all of these classified loans 
the following table shows the maturities of loans excluding real estate mortgages and installment loans outstanding as of december  after one within year but after one within five five fixed rate loans year years years total commercial and all other loans including overdrafts    variable rate loans commercial and all other loans including overdrafts     real estate construction     total     analysis of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses at december  and was  and  the change in the allowance account is comprised of net charge offs of and a provision for loan losses of  based on specific reserves for internally classified loans and multiple factors including historical experience and current economic conditions  management feels the level of the allowance for the loan losses provides adequate coverage 
currently  the bank s reserve ratio the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of end of period loans is 
at december  this same ratio stood at 
this level of reserves is adequate due to the quality of the portfolio  and is within the range of peer group banks 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  there is not an exact amount but rather a range for what constitutes an appropriate allowance 
as more fully discussed in the application of critical accounting policies section of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the process for estimating credit losses and determining the allowance for loan losses as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the following tables describe the activity in the allowance for loan losses account for the following years ended allowance for loan losses at beginning of period      loans charged off commercial real estate consumer total loans charged off recoveries on amounts previously charged off commercial real estate consumer total recoveries net charge offs recoveries reclassification to allowance for contingent liabilities current year s provision for loan losses   allowance for loan losses at end of period      total loans average loans  net      end of period net of unearned discount      ratios net charge offs recoveries to average loans loans at end of period allowance for loan losses provision for loan losses last year s charge offs to this year s recoveries allowance for loan losses at year end to average loans net of unearned discount end of period loans net of unearned discount allocation of allowance for loan losses the following table sets forth the allocation of the bank s allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans receivable  net  at the dates indicated 
the portion of the loan loss allowance allocated to each loan category does not represent the total available for future losses which may occur within the loan category since the total loan loss allowance is a valuation allocation applicable to the entire loan portfolio

the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
recent accounting pronouncements for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
non interest income  non interest expense and income taxes for vs 
noninterest income is comprised of income from operations of the company  excluding interest income 
the two largest contributors to noninterest income during and were service charge income from depositors  and revenues from the agency 
the agency was acquired by the bank as of august  during  the revenues from the insurance agency became the largest source of the bank s noninterest income 
was the first full year of operation for the bank s newly acquired subsidiary  and the results were very positive 
gross revenues from the agency during and for the four months of were  and  respectively 
net income from the agency was and for the same two period ends 
as the agency has become more fully integrated into the bank  the two entities have served as sources of referrals for each other  and additional synergies between the two have been identified 
providing various types of insurance to many of our loan customers  particularly those in the construction industry  has allowed the bank to offer them a complete package of products 
as the integration between the two affiliates continues  it is expected that additional cost savings to both companies will also be recognized 
service charge income on deposit accounts increased by during  despite the continued growth of free checking products 
this increase was due to the platinum overdraft product that was added in february this new product increased the bank s overdraft fee income by approximately over income 
an additional source of noninterest income for the bank was the gain on cash value of bank owned life insurance policies 
the total cash value of these insurance policies at december  was  as compared to  at december  the insurance polices were purchased to provide for tax free income to fund the accrual of various benefit plans for certain officers and directors 
this gain of has offset the majority of the cost for these benefits 
income from operations of the bank s trust department remained stable from to  and represented of total non interest income for assets under management for the trust department at year end and were  and  miscellaneous other noninterest income totaled  and for and  respectively 
the largest component of this category represented loan fee income  and it increased from in to in this increase was due to the fee income generated from short term loans originated during the year 
total noninterest expense for and was  and  an increase of during these expenses represent operating expenses of the company  and the largest components of these expenses are salary and benefit expense and occupancy expense 
during  salary and benefit expenses  in total  increased by 
one full year of the expenses of the agency is partially responsible for the increase 
the company s contribution to its pension plan remained stable at for both and the cost of medical insurance for the bank s employees increased by during although the staff contributes of the cost for this insurance  the additional paid for by the bank contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
salary expense also increased from to  partially due to the increased number of employees needed to staff the additional branches  to provide quality service to an increasing number of customers  and to manage the additional assets acquired during the year 
net occupancy expense increased from to by  due in large part to the additional rental expenses of the new corporate headquarters and new branch offices 
furniture and equipment expense increases were also a result of the new buildings 
despite these increasing operating expenses  efficiency improved from march  to december  by from to 
other miscellaneous operating expenses comprised and of total noninterest expense 
the largest categories of these expenses were business development and auditing and accounting expense 
marketing and advertising costs increased during as the bank incurred expenses in promoting various deposit products and rates 
auditing and accounting expenses also increased during by  primarily the result of increased fees required for compliance and audit work related to the sarbanes oxley act of  section as a result of the company s acquisition of the seigerman mulvey insurance agency intangible assets were acquired 
these intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationship intangibles which are required to be amortized on a declining balance in accordance with fasb the application of the declining balance method over the estimated life of seven years from acquisition date  will result in greatly increased amortization expense for the company during  with decreasing amortization expense during the following five years 
a schedule detailing these future amortization expenses can be found in note e 
to the company s financial statements 
income tax expense as a percentage of book income effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
despite state income taxes  holdings of municipal securities provide a source of tax free income which reduces the bank s overall federal income tax rate 
bank owned life insurance policies also reduced the company s tax liability 
for vs 
noninterest income for increased by over levels  primarily due to the net gain on sales of available for sale securities 
securities were sold during the year in order to provide funds to meet strong loan demand 
income from trust operations decreased during due to the settlement of several trusts during this business was not replaced and therefore the fee income generated from these trusts was not earned during service charge income on deposit accounts also declined during as a result of an increased number of free checking accounts 
total other noninterest expenses increased by from to the expansion into new corporate headquarters as well as new branch facilities were responsible for the additional costs 
salary and benefit expenses increased by from to net occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses also increased over levels by 
noteworthy within the category of noninterest expenses were the increased costs incurred by the company for auditing and accounting services 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  section  required a very large use of resources within the bank as well as the assistance of an internal audit firm to assist management in setting up and testing the internal control framework of the bank 
these costs were in excess of  the effective tax rate of the company for was as compared to for  partially resulting from the lower income received from holdings of municipal securities in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant increases in the level of market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest earning assets 
at december  and  the following levels of securities and loans carried fixed interest rates balance of portfolio balance of portfolio investment securities   loans   generally  the value of fixed rate investments varies inversely to changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets 
this decrease in market value could adversely affect the company s results of operations if the loans or securities were sold or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  could reduce the company s stockholders equity if they were to be retained 
a significant increase in the level of market interest rates could also adversely affect the bank s net interest income and net interest margin 
now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts all can be repriced on a daily basis 
if they were all to be repriced upward due to the competitive pressures of a general increase in market rates  net interest income could be reduced 
based on historical experience  increases in deposit rates typically lag increases in loan rates  in which case  the increase in interest expense on these deposits would be offset by the increase in interest income on the loans 
the bank monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and interest rate gap analysis 
both of these techniques project future net interest income based on changes in interest rates 
gap analysis requires estimates of when all categories of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice 
gap analysis looks at stated maturities and assumes all assets and liabilities within the same maturity time frame will reprice 
it does not look at the probability of repricing  which in the case of nonmaturity deposits  is up to the discretion of management 
interest rate sensitivity models also rely on various estimates and assumptions  and although a great deal of time and effort is devoted to arriving at these assumptions  any change in the assumptions input into the model can produce very different results 
therefore  both of these techniques may not accurately reflect the actual impact of changes in the interest rate environment on the bank s net interest income 
in spite of these shortcomings  the bank utilizes the results of the dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income fluctuations resulting from sustained interest rate changes 
management monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are compared to policy limits set internally by the asset liability committee that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given both an upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the last simulation analysis was modeled on a one hundred and two hundred basis point upward and one hundred basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s most recent income sensitivity analysis change in interest rates as of november  in basis points potential change in rate shock net interest income change change up basis points  up basis points  static down basis points
