item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies we follow conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
while we base our estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on our financial statements 
the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowances for losses on loans  leases and foreclosed assets 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll and the allowance for losses on foreclosed assets on a quarterly basis for the purpose of maintaining appropriate allowances to provide for losses inherent in the loan  lease and foreclosed asset portfolios 
a key component to the evaluation is the internal asset review process 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review the recommendations from the internal asset review department for asset classifications and valuation allowances 
on a monthly basis  we monitor and modify the alll based upon economic conditions  loss experience  changes in portfolio composition and other factors 
in determining the amount of the general valuation allowance gva portion of the alll  we stratify our loan portfolio into approximately segments based upon factors such as loan type and internal classification 
each of these segments is assigned a separate probable loss factor 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the office of thrift supervision the ots who can order the establishment of additional loss allowances 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the alll 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of valuation allowances 
the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and that management establish an acceptable allowance evaluation process that meets the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
while the bank believes that it has established an adequate alll  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan and lease portfolio  will not request the bank to materially increase its alll  thereby negatively affecting the bank s financial condition and earnings 
although management believes that an adequate alll has been established  further additions to the level of alll may become necessary

financial derivatives 
we have entered into a financial derivative to manage the cash flow variability risk associated with our junior subordinated debentures 
a financial derivative instrument is designated as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge  a hedge of the variability in expected future cash flows associated with an existing recognized asset or liability or a probable forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge or held for other risk management purposes risk management derivatives 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
changes in fair value of derivatives that are not in hedge accounting relationships are included in the determination of net earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
changes in the value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to the extent such hedges are deemed highly effective  are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the earnings effect of the hedged cash flows is recognized 
changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationships are included in the determination of net earnings along with the change in fair value of the hedged item 
the determination of whether a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting requires judgment about the application of statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires contemporaneous documentation of the company s hedge relationships 
such documentation includes the nature of the risk being hedged  identification of the asset or cash flow  or the group of assets or cash flows  that share the risk exposure that is designated as being hedged  and the selection of the instrument that will be used to hedge the identified risk and the method used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge 

table of contents asset liability management our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread collectively  interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the policies designed to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and net present value of shareholders equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities is based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed

based on contractual maturity 
table of contents a gap table is limited to measuring timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk the risk that various indices to which our assets and liabilities are tied eg prime and cofi will not move with equal speed and magnitude when the general level of interest rates moves either up or down 
to better measure our exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
we forecast our net interest income for the next twelve months  and our npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  we subject our balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
our model provides forecasts of net interest income and npv for each of those rate change scenarios 
the table below indicates the results of our internal modeling of our balance sheet as of march  and the internal calculation of our sensitivity to changes in interest rates would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if our customers responses to changes in interest rates resulted in changes in the structure of our balance sheet 
march  march  percentage change change in interest rates basis points net interest income net portfolio value net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for a one year period assuming we do not change the structure of our balance sheet 
this percentage change represents the npv for us assuming no changes to the structure of our balance sheet 
the results from the asset liability model indicate that net interest income would come under greater downward pressure from upward shocks than it would have one year ago 
additionally  the net portfolio value of equity would be more adversely impacted in rising rates than one year ago 
the reasons for this include the following the short end of the yield curve has risen by approximately basis points in the past year creating a virtually flat yield curve 
most of the bank s liabilities are priced  and derive their market values  off of the shorter end of the yield curve 
with the increase in the short end of the curve  we have experienced increasing funding costs  which when shocked further in our interest rate risk model  are anticipated to increase faster than many of the bank s earning assets hybrids  fixed rate products  and adjustable rate products that have periodic caps are able to increase during the course of the year 
with the rising rate environment  we have experienced a slowing in prepayment activity on hybrids from an average cpr of in fiscal to a cpr of in fiscal during the final quarter of fiscal  the cpr on the hybrids which comprise a large portion of our loan portfolio averaged 
slowing loan prepayments reduce the ability for cash flows to be reinvested during periods of rising rates constraining growth in interest income and negatively impacting the market values of those loans 
depositors have shifted from core deposit accounts to certificate accounts cds 
at march   cds accounted for of total deposits compared to at march  core deposit 
table of contents products generally have administered rates that respond slower to rising rates providing greater interest income protection 
additionally  core deposits are ascribed with an intangible value that is enhanced during periods of rising interest rates 
during the past year we have changed the modeling assumptions for our interest bearing core deposit products 
while core deposit accounts are anticipated to exhibit less sensitivity to rate changes than either cds or fixed rate borrowings  it is anticipated that they will exhibit greater sensitivity to upward movements in rates at march  than one year earlier 
the increase in the general level of short term interest rates resulting from the federal reserve s tightening of monetary policy beginning in june has increased the differential between rates paid on cds and interest bearing core deposits providing depositors with a greater opportunity to increase returns by transferring from core deposits to cds 
our assumption of increased rate sensitivity for our core deposits is also based upon changes in the general competitive environment 
we are continuing to see increasing rate driven competition for our deposit customers in the form of competitors promotional offerings on cds and higher rate money market accounts throughout the year 
throughout the year we will continue to make every effort to increase our deposit base through reasonable rate negotiation and promotional offerings 
our modeling indicates increased sensitivity to the npv of equity at march  compared to march  the factors discussed above affecting the sensitivity of earnings have contributed to the increased sensitivity of npv 
the slowing prepayments on our hybrid products combined with the shift in deposits from core deposits  with an assumed intangible asset value  to cds  not assumed to have an intangible asset value  have contributed to the increased sensitivity 

table of contents results of operations overview assets total assets increased million or during fiscal to billion 
subsequent to our march  earnings release dated april   we reclassified our march  balance sheet  reducing prepaid expenses and other assets and deposits by million 
the increase in total assets reflects a million or increase in loans and leases receivable  net 
the million increase in loans and leases receivable  net  is comprised of a million or increase in the four cs and a million or increase in residential multi family loans  partially offset by a million reduction in one to four family residential mortgages reflecting our continued emphasis on the higher yielding four cs loan products 
that emphasis is further demonstrated by the origination figures in the following table year ended march  amount percentage of total originations amount percentage of total originations amount percentage of total originations dollars in thousands construction and land commercial real estate consumer commercial loans and leases subtotal four cs residential and other total originations includes family and multi family 
the net disbursed balance of the four cs increased million between march  and and million between march  and at march   the aggregate disbursed balance of the four cs was billion or of loans and leases receivable  net compared to billion or of loans and leases receivable  net at march  we are continuing to allocate our capital first to supporting our strong four cs loan growth and secondly to maintaining a consistent upward progression in our quarterly cash dividend based on a targeted dividend payout ratio of approximately percent of earnings 
it has been our policy that excess capital above our targeted capital to assets ratio range of approximately be made available to our stock repurchase program 
see part ii item market for registrants common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
we believe that utilizing excess capital to repurchase our common stock is preferable to growing our securities portfolio or increasing our portfolio of lower yielding one to four family residential mortgages 
reflecting that philosophy  we have established an internal guideline of limiting securities as a percentage of total assets to no more than percent 
at march   securities represented of total assets and averaged of total average assets for fiscal we also are seeking to hold our one to four family residential mortgages relatively flat in absolute dollar terms 

table of contents liabilities deposits increased million or during fiscal to billion 
reflecting a widening rate differential between cds and interest bearing liquid accounts arising from increases in the general level of interest rates  our cd balances increased million or during fiscal  while core deposits decreased million 
at march   core deposits of billion represented of the total deposits compared to billion or of total deposit one year ago 
during fiscal  we issued million of junior subordinated debentures in addition to the million issued during fiscal the proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debentures were used as a funding vehicle for diversified builder services  inc as well as for general corporate purposes 
see part item description of business sources of funds junior subordinated debentures and regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation and liquidity and capital resources within this section 
the million increase in fhlb advances and other borrowings during fiscal reflects the need for additional funding for our four cs loan growth 
additionally  we entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of million with a commercial bank 
at march   million was available under the million line of credit 
the line of credit is being used primarily as a funding vehicle for dbs to finance its builder service operations  as well as for general corporate purposes 
subsequent to march   the line of credit was increased to million 
stockholders equity total stockholders equity increased from million or of total assets at march  to million or of total assets at march  at march   we were within our target range  while at march   we were slightly above that range 
consistent with our philosophy of favoring share repurchases over increasing our investment in securities  during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
we also increased our quarterly cash dividend by to per share effective with our dividend paid in march our dividend payout ratio for fiscal was 
see part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
operating results our net income for fiscal totaled million or per diluted share  up from million or per diluted share for fiscal  and million or per diluted share for fiscal the increase in our net income between fiscal years was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income arising from growth in average interest earning assets 
while total non interest income between fiscal years remained essentially unchanged  the components of total non interest income changed as follows deposit and related fees increased with the growth in transaction accounts 
trust  investment and insurance fees increased with the growth in assets under custody or management 
other non interest income increased primarily due to a non recurring non cash credit relating to our interest rate swaps 
the above mentioned increases in non interest income were offset by lower gains on sales of investment securities 

table of contents partially offsetting the increase in net interest income was an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses attributable to portfolio growth and an increase in general and administrative expense attributable principally to compensation and benefits expense 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans and leases  and securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities are the principal items affecting net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in fiscal  up million or from fiscal net interest income increased million or between fiscal and these increases were primarily attributable to increases in average interest earnings assets of million or between fiscal and and million or between fiscal and net interest spread expanded basis points between fiscal and to  due to the continued growth in our higher yielding four cs coupled with strong growth in deposits  which continue to provide a more cost effective source of funding than do other borrowings 
net interest spread contracted by basis point between fiscal and this relatively unchanged spread occurred during a period when short term market interest rates were rising 
the company was able to maintain a funding cost stability through growth in core deposits 
loan and asset yields remained relatively stable between fiscal and due to the impact of current repricing indices eg prime being offset by the impact of lagging indices eg cofi and cmt 
see item business lending activities  for details of loan portfolio repricing characteristics 
net interest income for all periods presented reflects the reclassification of loan prepayment fees and amortization of extension fees from loan and servicing fees to interest income on loans and leases receivable 
our net interest spread and net interest income are also impacted by the repricing or rate adjustment characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  net interest spread and net interest margin 
net interest margin reflects net interest spread and the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities

additionally  glencrest has assets under advisory of million as of march  as compared to million at march  and million at march  gain on sale of loans our community banking business strategy does not include aggressively pursuing the origination of loans for sale 
the four cs have consistently comprised in excess of of total originations and those four product types are originated for portfolio as opposed to sale 
additionally  we retain for portfolio virtually all adjustable rate residential mortgages we originate 
accordingly  the principal balances of loans sold during fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
this activity generated net gains on sales of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
gain on sale of securities we generally follow a buy and hold strategy with respect to our securities portfolio 
while the overwhelming majority of our securities portfolio is classified as available for sale  sales activity has been and is expected to continue to be infrequent 
securities with cost bases aggregating  million and million were sold for fiscal  and  respectively  generating gain on sales of securities of  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the sales during fiscal consisted entirely of an investment in a single equity security  the entire balance of which was sold prior to september  the sales during fiscal were comprised of a portion of our investment in the above mentioned single equity security 
we also sold a portion of our investment in this security during fiscal  at a gain of million 
as a result of the strong price appreciation of this security  prudent risk diversification required that the investment be reduced incrementally 
we no longer hold any investment in this equity security 
the million net gain for fiscal included a million loss on sale of million of investment grade trust preferred securities 
other non interest income our other non interest income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the million for fiscal included a million non cash credit associated with the interest rate swaps described below under financial derivatives 
the million for fiscal included a million non recurring increase in cash surrender value of split dollar life insurance policies that we own

at march   our balance sheet includes total cash surrender value of million included in other assets 
non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal and million or of average assets for fiscal while our balance sheet  which is primarily comprised by four cs and core deposits  generates higher levels of net interest income than would a balance sheet comprised by residential mortgage loans and cds  our higher margin business is also more cost intensive  particularly with respect to staffing and compensation levels 
the relationship between net revenue net interest income plus non interest income and operating costs expended to generate that revenue is measured by our efficiency ratio 
our efficiency ratio was for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal these efficiency ratios indicate that the growth in our net revenue has exceeded the growth in operating costs 
excluding gains on sales of securities and the non cash credit relating to the interest rate swaps  our efficiency ratio improved to for fiscal from for fiscal and from for fiscal 
table of contents we expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the future  since over the past several years  it has been necessary for us to incur infrastructure costs to support the increased volumes of higher margin business in advance of those volumes being generated 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense accounted for million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and and million or of the million increase in general and administrative expense between fiscal and fiscal these increases reflect increases in both the number and compensation levels of staff required to support our higher margin lending four cs and deposit gathering core deposits activities  offset by a significant reduction of employee stock ownership plan esop expense in the increases in compensation and benefits also reflect the bank s opening of two new full service retail branches during fiscal and three new full service retail branches during fiscal included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal  and  respectively are non cash charges of million  million and million associated with the bank s esop and supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
our serp serves only to deliver benefits that would otherwise be reduced below the level available to all other employees of the company because of salary limitations imposed by law on our qualified benefit plans 
the amounts charged to expense under these plans move upward or downward with changes in the market price of our common stock 
for the year ended march   esop expense of million was based on  shares being amortized through the nine months ended december   a reduction from the amortization level for fiscal all shares under the original esop established in had been allocated by december  the esop will be continued at least through calendar on a year to year basis through the purchase of additional shares of our stock throughout the year 
accordingly  there was  of esop expense accrued in the quarter ended march  we expect quarterly esop expense to approximate this level throughout calendar year also in fiscal  we accrued million for our equity based long term incentive plan wherein employees were granted performance based restricted stock awards and board members were granted service based restricted stock awards 
the awards in this plan were accounted for under fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of fasb no 
statement no 
sfas r which we implemented in april marketing and professional services the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and million for fiscal was attributable to the marketing efforts associated with new full service branch office openings and an increase in expenditures associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities we serve 
other general and administrative expense our other general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the  decrease between fiscal and was primarily attributable to lower correspondent bank service charges in fiscal and in fiscal a charge off of a community reinvestment act cra investment and interest charges associated with the filing of amended tax returns 
these items were partially offset by  of additional operational expenses primarily due to the growth in our deposit portfolio and the number of transaction accounts 
transaction accounts increased from  at march  to  at march  the million increase between fiscal and was primarily attributable to an increase in correspondent bank service charges  office supplies and equipment for our three new full service branch offices  and the aforementioned cra charge off and amended tax returns charges 

table of contents income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the effective income tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the permanent difference associated with our esop  whereby the difference between the fair value of the esop shares allocated each year over the cost basis of those shares is not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects the reduction in shares amortized under our esop as noted above under compensation and benefits  resulting in a reduced permanent tax difference 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the continuing ability to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost effective basis 
our most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march  cash and short term investments totaled million 
effective july  the ots adopted a rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
our internal policy is to maintain cash and readily marketable debt securities with final maturities of one year or less equal to approximately three percent of total deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings maturing within one year our defined liquidity ratio 
at march   our defined liquidity ratio was 
our defined liquidity ratio averaged for fiscal in determining the adequacy of liquidity and borrowing capacity  we also consider large customer deposit concentrations  particularly with respect to core deposits  which provide immediate withdrawal opportunity 
at march   our largest core deposit relationship was million and our ten largest core deposit relationships aggregated million 
as an additional component of liquidity management  we seek to maintain sufficient mortgage and securities collateral at the fhlb to enable us to immediately borrow an amount equal to at least five percent of total assets 
at march   our immediate borrowing capacity was million or of the bank s total assets 
additionally  we have the capability to borrow funds from the federal reserve bank discount window 
as of march   our borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank was approximately million 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  leases and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  and to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans  leases and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our strategy is to manage liquidity by investing excess cash flows in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans  leases and securities  or paying down fhlb advances and other borrowings  depending on market conditions 
conversely  if the need for funds is not met through deposits and cash flows from loans  leases and securities  we initiate fhlb advances and other borrowings  or if necessary and of economic benefit  sell loans and or securities 
only when no other alternatives exist will we constrain loan originations as a means of addressing a liquidity shortfall 
we have not found it necessary to constrain loan originations due to liquidity considerations 
our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 

table of contents cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
this increase in net cash provided by operating activities from million in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million increase in net earnings between fiscal and a million increase in loan and lease fees collected  which is primarily due to the increase in loan originations from fiscal to the above increases were partially offset by million decrease in gains on sale of loans  mortgage backed securities available for sale  real estate and property and equipment between fiscal and the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in net earnings and a smaller decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a larger decrease in prepaid assets 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of disbursements for loan and lease originations and purchases and securities purchases  offset by principal collections on loans  leases and proceeds from maturation and paydowns on securities 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million increase in the origination of loans and leases held for investment in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting the robust economic activity and real estate development taking place in the markets in which we operate 
a million decrease in purchases of loans held for investment reflecting our strategy of placing our loan growth focus on the four cs  and increasing our one to four family residential loan origination capabilities as the primary means of stabilizing the one to four portfolio 
during fiscal our loan purchases have been primarily in the multi family loan category 
during fiscal and  loan purchases were primarily in the one to four family residential loan category 
a million increase in purchases of investment securities and mortgage backed securities available for sale to offset paydowns and maintain a portfolio level consistent with our liquidity strategy 
a million decrease in proceeds from the sale and maturity of investment securities available for sale 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in purchases of loans held for investment  partially offset by an increase in loan originations 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to the following items a million increase in the use of fhlb advances and other borrowings in fiscal as compared to fiscal an increase in deposit growth from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the use of fhlb advances and other borrowings  partially offset by an increase in deposits and the issuance of junior subordinated debentures 

table of contents deposits  particularly core deposits  provide a more preferable source of funding than do fhlb advances and other borrowings 
however  as and to the extent competitive or market factors do not allow us to meet our funding needs with deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings provide a readily available source of liquidity 
as of march  and  the bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the fhlb of san francisco of billion and billion  respectively 
based upon pledged collateral in place  the available borrowing capacity was million and million at march  and  respectively 
we also have the ability to borrow funds under reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by securities and revolving lines of credit from a commercial bank 
we had zero borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at march  and we had an unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of million with a commercial bank as of march  the line of credit had an outstanding balance of million 
subsequent to march   the revolving line of credit with the commercial bank was increased to million 
additionally  we have the capability to borrow funds from the federal reserve bank discount window 
as of march   our borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank was approximately million 
at march   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a tangible capital level of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of adjusted total assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or

at march   we had no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures 
at march   we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans of million and none  respectively  compared to million and none  respectively  at march  standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
at march  and  we had standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our commitments 
at march  and  we had no outstanding commitments to purchase securities 
see item business general 
certificate accounts that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from march  totaled billion 
we expect that we will retain a substantial portion of the funds from maturing cds at maturity either in cds or liquid accounts 
the low interest rate environment during fiscal and the early stages of fiscal resulted in a reduction in the differential between cds and more liquid instruments such as money market accounts 
accordingly  a portion of our maturing cds were reinvested by customers into more liquid accounts until such time as the rate differential between cds and liquid accounts increased 
during the later stages of fiscal and throughout fiscal  in response to the increases in short term interest rates initiated by the federal reserve  as well as competitive market forces  rates on cds have increased disproportionately to those of more liquid accounts 
as a result  we have seen a shift in customer behavior back towards cds 
we anticipate that this shift in consumer preference will continue as and to the extent general market conditions create continued widening of the rate differential between cds and liquid accounts 
table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
our obligations generally relate to funding of our operations through deposits and borrowings as well as leases for premises and equipment  and our commitments generally relate to our lending operations 
we have obligations under long term operating leases  principally for building space and land 
lease terms generally cover a five year period  with options to extend  and are non cancelable 
currently  we have no significant vendor contractual obligations 
our commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed  but committed to construction projects and home equity and commercial lines of credit 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since some commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines and letters of credit requires the same creditworthiness evaluation as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness 
we receive collateral to support commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral include real estate properties underlying mortgage loans  liens on personal property and cash on deposit with us 
we have entered into two interest rate swaps  in which we pay a fixed interest payment and receive a floating interest payment 
these interest rate swaps were entered in connection with the two issuances of our junior subordinated debentures

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  leases  investments and other interest earnings assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
loan and lease volumes and yields  as well as the volume and rates on investments  deposits and borrowings  are affected by market interest rates 
additionally  because of the terms and conditions of many of our loan and lease agreements and deposit accounts  a change in rates could also affect the duration of the loan portfolio and or the deposit base  which could alter our sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk management focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits while taking into consideration  among other factors  our overall credit  operating income  operating cost and capital profile 
disclosure related to market risk is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability management contained in item of this form k 
financial derivatives it is the policy of the company not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
however  the company may enter into financial derivatives in order to seek to mitigate exposure to interest rate risks related to specific interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  mitigate interest rate risk inherent in specific financial instruments 
to date  our derivatives activities have been limited to two pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swaps entered into in connection with our two issuances of junior subordinated debentures 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings  together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged 
if there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged  then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
concurrent with the issuance of floating rate junior subordinated debentures during september and  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating million 
these swaps were designed to hedge the cash flows associated with the debentures against changes in the three month london interbank offered rate month libor to which the interest payments on the debentures are tied 
from an economic standpoint  these swaps are expected to continue to be fully effective in hedging the 
table of contents floating rate nature of the debt against changes in month libor 
at inception  these swaps were documented and designated as cash flow hedges using the short cut method provisions of sfas during the quarter ended march   a clarification of the documentation requirements of sfas resulted in a determination that because of an interest deferral provision contained in the debt securities  the use of the short cut method for establishing a cash flow hedging relationship was not appropriate 
during march  we redesignated these swaps for cash flow hedge treatment using the long haul method prescribed by sfas however  under the provisions of sfas  a non cash credit of million representing the cumulative net increase in the fair value of the swaps from inception through the february date on which the long haul documentation was completed has been included in other non interest income for the three months ended march  increasing net earnings for fiscal by  or per diluted share 
this non cash credit will reverse over the remaining terms of the swaps which run through september and other than changes in value associated with hedge ineffectiveness  which we expect to be inconsequential  any future changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps will not be reflected in the statement of earnings and be recorded directly to equity as a component of other comprehensive income
