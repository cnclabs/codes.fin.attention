operation of properties the day to day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of an operator designated under pooling or operating agreements 
the operator supervises production  maintains production records  employs field personnel and performs other functions 
we are the operator of  of our wells 
as operator  we receive reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of our duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged in the area 
in presenting our financial data  we record the monthly overhead reimbursements as a reduction of general and administrative expense  which is a common industry practice 
organization structure our north american properties are concentrated within five geographic areas 
operations in the united states are focused in the permian basin  the mid continent  the rocky mountains and onshore and offshore gulf coast regions 
canadian properties are focused in the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta and british columbia 
properties outside north america are located primarily in azerbaijan  china  egypt and areas in west africa  including equatorial guinea  gabon  and cote d ivoire 
additionally  we have exploratory interests  but no current producing assets  in other international countries including angola  brazil  ghana and nigeria 
maintaining a tight geographic focus in selected core areas has allowed us to improve operating and capital efficiency

canadian dollars converted to us dollars at the rate of canadian us united states permian basin our permian basin assets are located in portions of southeast new mexico and west texas 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties producing from a wide variety of geologic formations and depths 
our leasehold position in southeast new mexico encompasses  net acres of developed lands and  net acres of undeveloped land and minerals 
historically  we have been a very active operator in this area  developing gas from the high productivity morrow formation and oil in the lower risk delaware formation 
in the west texas portion of the permian basin  we maintain a base of oil production with long life reserves 
many of these reserves are from both operated and non operated positions in large enhanced oil recovery units such as the wasson odc unit  the willard unit  the reeves unit  the north welch unit and the anton irish clearfork unit 
these oil producing units often exhibit low decline rates 
we also own a significant acreage position in west texas with more than  net acres of developed lands and more than  net acres of undeveloped land and minerals at december  mid continent the mid continent region includes portions of texas  oklahoma and kansas 
these areas encompass a wide variety of geologic formations and productive depths and produce both oil and natural gas 
our mid continent production has historically come from conventional oil and gas properties 
however  the barnett shale in north texas  acquired in  is a non conventional gas resource 
the mid continent region represented of our proved reserves at december  approximately of our proved reserves in the mid continent area are in the barnett shale 
the barnett shale  our largest producing field  is known as a tight gas formation 
this means that in its natural state  the formation is resistant to the production of natural gas 
however  the application of available technology has made the barnett shale a low risk and highly profitable natural gas operation 
cumulative natural gas production from our wells in the barnett shale surpassed one trillion cubic feet during we hold  net acres and over  producing wells in the barnett shale 
our average working interest is more than 
we have been successful in extracting gas from the barnett shale by using light sand fracturing 
light sand fracturing yields better results than earlier techniques  is less expensive and can be used to complete new wells and to refracture existing wells to increase production rates 
we are also applying horizontal drilling  closer well spacing and reservoir optimization techniques to further enhance the value of the barnett shale 
our marketing and midstream operations gather and process our barnett shale production along with barnett shale production from unrelated third parties 
the barnett shale gathering system consists of approximately  miles of pipeline  a mmcf per day gas processing plant  and a  bbls per day ngl fractionator 
in  we plan to drill a total of new barnett shale wells including horizontal and vertical wells 
we began an infill drilling program on our core area acreage in and plan to drill to horizontal infill wells in current net production from the barnett shale is approximately mboe per day 

table of contents rocky mountain our operations in the rocky mountain region include properties in wyoming  montana  utah  and northern new mexico 
these assets include conventional oil and gas properties and coalbed natural gas projects 
approximately of our proved reserves in the rocky mountains are from coalbed natural gas 
we began producing coalbed natural gas in the san juan basin of new mexico in the mid s and began drilling coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin of wyoming in as of december   we had approximately  producing coalbed natural gas wells in the powder river basin 
net coalbed natural gas production from the basin was approximately mboe per day as of december  we plan to drill about new wells in the powder river basin in the washakie field in wyoming is another significant natural gas producing area in our rocky mountain region 
in  we drilled wells in the washakie field  including wells we operate 
in  we plan to drill up to wells and participate in another outside operated wells 
we have interests in over  gross acres and an inventory of more than drilling locations 
our current net production from washakie is approximately mboe per day 
gulf coast onshore our gulf coast onshore properties are located in south and east texas  louisiana and mississippi 
most of the wells in the region are completed in conventional sandstone formations 
our operations in south texas have focused on exploration in the edwards  wilcox and frio vicksburg formations 
we drilled three exploratory discoveries on our gulf coast acreage in drilling plans in include new wells and recompletions 
east texas is an important conventional gas producing region  and carthage and groesbeck are two of the primary producing areas of this region 
wells produce from the cotton valley sands  the travis peak sands and from shallower sands and carbonates 
we have interests in over  producing wells in east texas and plans to drill wells in carthage and over wells in groesbeck in we have an active exploration program under way in the bossier trend in north louisiana 
we hold about  net acres in seven bossier prospect areas 
we drilled exploratory test wells on the vixen and north vixen prospects in plans for include test wells on three additional bossier prospects 
gulf offshore the offshore gulf of mexico accounted for of our production 
we operate over platforms and caissons in the gulf of mexico 
gulf of mexico operations are typically differentiated by water depth 
the shallow water shelf is defined by water depths of feet or less 
we operate in both the shelf and deepwater areas 
in  we continued development of the deepwater magnolia field garden banks 
at december   six magnolia wells were producing approximately mboe per day to our interest 
the final two magnolia producing wells will be completed in also in  we will complete two producing gas wells in the deepwater merganser field atwater valley 
merganser will produce into the independence hub  which is expected to be completed in early we expect our net share of production from merganser to be approximately eight mboe per day 
in addition to our producing properties  we have a significant inventory of exploration prospects in the gulf of mexico 
the current prospect inventory includes shelf prospects  deepwater prospects in the lower tertiary trend and deepwater miocene prospects 
on the shallow water shelf  the industry is exploring for oil and gas reserves at depths in excess of  feet 
we drilled a deep shelf discovery well on the big bend prospect mustang island a in we are the operator of big bend with a working interest 

table of contents in the deepwater gulf of mexico  almost all historical production of oil and gas has been from miocene aged reservoirs 
we currently produce approximately mboe per day from the deepwater gulf 
during  we expect to drill exploratory wells on three miocene prospects 
in recent years  the industry has begun to explore for oil below the miocene in older formations that are collectively referred to as the lower tertiary 
to date  we have participated in three lower tertiary discoveries 
cascade walker ridge was our first discovery in the lower tertiary trend 
we drilled successful appraisal wells on the prospect in also in  we drilled a successful appraisal of the jack lower tertiary discovery walker ridge 
an extended production test of the jack appraisal well is planned for using information obtained from a successful production test  we and our partners will be able to determine a development plan for the jack discovery 
we hold working interests in jack and cascade 
our third lower tertiary discovery is st 
malo walker ridge 
additional appraisal drilling on st 
malo is pending partner approval and rig availability 
we have a working interest in the st 
malo discovery 
canada we are among the largest independent oil and gas producers in canada and operate in most of the producing basins in western canada 
as of december   of our proved reserves were in canada 
many of the canadian basins where we operate are accessible for drilling only in the winter when the ground is frozen 
consequently  the winter season  from december through march  is the most active drilling period 
we expect to drill about wells in the winter program in canada 
we hold approximately  net undeveloped acres in the deep basin in west central alberta  where we drilled wells in and have another active drilling program planned for the profitability of our operations in the deep basin is enhanced by our ownership in nine gas processing plants in the area 
deep basin reservoirs tend to be rich in liquids  producing up to barrels of ngls with each mmcf of gas 
other important oil and gas exploration and development areas in canada include the peace river arch  northeast british columbia  central alberta and the lloydminster region of alberta and saskatchewan 
at lloydminster  cold flow heavy oil is found in multiple horizons generally at depths of  to  feet 
in  we acquired  net acres in the iron river area within the greater lloydminster region 
we expect to drill wells at iron river over the next four years 
the oil sands of eastern alberta are a vast north american hydrocarbon resource 
we hold over  net acres of oil sands leases in alberta 
in  we received final regulatory approval to proceed with development of our jackfish thermal oil sands project  in which we have a working interest 
the project is expected to produce mbbls per day of heavy oil when fully operational in we expect to drill horizontal wells at jackfish in along with the construction of the access dual pipeline 
access will transport diluent and blended crude oil between jackfish and edmonton 
international beyond our core properties in the united states and canada  we also look outside north america for longer term reserve and production growth 
at december   these international areas accounted for of our worldwide proved reserves 
the most significant international producing property is the exxonmobil operated zafiro oil field on block b  offshore equatorial guinea in west africa 
during  our share of production from zafiro averaged mbbls per day 
we expect to drill nine development wells on block b in we drilled a discovery on the esmeralda prospect on block b in we have also identified exploratory prospects on 
table of contents block b and on three additional blocks in equatorial guinea 
three exploratory wells are planned on block p in we drilled a discovery well on the venus prospect on block p in our second most significant international producing asset is our panyu project offshore china 
panyu  in the pearl river mouth of the south china sea  was discovered in panyu production began late in we drilled and completed five successful development wells and tested two exploratory prospects during during  our share of production from china was mbbls per day 
we also have an active offshore exploration program in brazil 
we made a discovery in offshore brazil on block bm c development of the polvo discovery commenced in and first production is expected in we  in partnership with petrobras on three blocks  were the successful bidder on three offshore blocks in brazil s bid round seven in we expect to drill five exploration wells in brazil in in azerbaijan  we have a carried working interest in the azeri chirag gunashli  or acg  oil development project in the caspian sea 
we estimate that the acg field contains over five billion barrels of gross proved oil reserves 
oil production from the acg field began ramping up in after the central azeri platform came on line 
based on economic factors existing at december   our net share of acg production is expected to increase to between to mbbls per day in early when payout is reached 
we also hold interests in angola  cote d ivoire  egypt  gabon  ghana  indonesia  nigeria  and russia 
exploratory wells in egypt and nigeria are planned for title to properties title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry  liens for current taxes not yet due and  in some instances  other encumbrances 
we believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of such properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 
as is customary in the industry  other than a preliminary review of local records  little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties 
investigations  generally including a title opinion of outside counsel  are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties 
item legal proceedings royalty matters numerous gas producers and related parties  including devon  have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal false claims act
