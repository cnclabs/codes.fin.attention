item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company service corporation international sci or the company is north america s leading provider of deathcare products and services  with a network of funeral homes and cemeteries unequalled in geographic scale and reach 
sci operated in states and seven canadian provinces  with  funeral homes and cemeteries at december  during  these businesses in north america generated more than of the company s revenues 

table of contents sci owns a percent equity interest in akh luxco sca  more commonly referred to as pompes funebres g n rales pfg  france s leading provider of funeral services  and kenyon international emergency services  a wholly owned subsidiary that specializes in providing disaster management services in mass fatality incidents 
we also have funeral homes in germany and singapore that we intend to exit when economic values and conditions are conducive to a sale 
competitive strengths industry leadership sci s estimated percent share based on industry revenue is approximately twice that of its next largest competitor and approximately equal to the combined share of the remaining six publicly traded deathcare companies 
the remaining percent of deathcare services in north america is rendered by independent and non profit entities  many of which lack the benefits of standardized training  industry best practices and efficiencies of scale  but many are effective competitors 
geographic reach sci s network of more than  businesses in states and seven canadian provinces allows us to serve a broad population base 
this strategic asset differentiates us from our competition and has enabled us to be the only funeral service company in north america to implement a national brand and to pursue strategic affinity partnerships with national groups that can influence their members choice of deathcare provider 
a national network also gives us substantial purchasing power and provides us with an advantage in selling preneed funeral and cemetery products and services 
customers who choose to arrange their funeral or cemetery options in advance have the ability to transfer these preneed contracts to any of the business providers in our geographically diverse network 
national brand in  sci introduced the first coast to coast funeral service brand in north america  dignity memorial 
we intend to make the dignity memorial brand stand for integrity  respect and service excellence wherever we do business and to support the creation of enduring family and community relationships 
having a national brand name will be increasingly important  we believe  as north american consumers become geographically more mobile 
consumers are less likely now to live in the same community as their parents and grandparents or to know a local funeral director personally 
by building favorable associations with the dignity memorial brand through funeral services  advertising and community outreach programs we strive to create an image of consistency  dependability and excellence that may influence consumers to choose our providers 
sci does not use the dignity memorial brand to replace the names of well known local funeral homes and cemeteries  rather  the dignity memorial name is used in a co branding strategy representing the industry s highest standards and best practices 
we are currently developing a second brand  funeraria del angel tm  to serve north america s growing hispanic population 
funeraria del angel tm currently has locations in california  texas  illinois  and kansas 
sci plans aggressively to pursue additional opportunities to expand funeraria del angel tm in predominantly hispanic areas during innovative offerings using our dignity memorial brand  we are augmenting our range of traditional products and services with more contemporary and comprehensive offerings 
in addition to a wide range of funeral  memorial  burial and cremation options  we offer assistance with many of the legal and administrative details that burden customers at times of loss 
these additional services include grief counseling for survivors and assistance with legal and other family business details 
we also offer a bereavement travel program  which obtains special rates on airfare  car rentals and hotel accommodations for family and friends traveling from out of town to attend services and an internet memorialization 
we also offer packaged plans for funerals and cremations that are designed to simplify customer decision making 
since our packaged plans were introduced in  they have achieved consistently high customer 
table of contents satisfaction ratings 
in  we also test marketed packaged cemetery plans  which we have now implemented in numerous locations 
in  we introduced improved merchandising displays in our funeral homes that place less emphasis on traditional funeral merchandise and more focus on the comprehensive product and service offerings unique to dignity memorial providers as described above 
similarly  in our cemetery segment we introduced a tiered product strategy with a particular focus on the development of high end cemetery property such as private family estates 
reputation and service excellence while heavily regulated at the federal and state levels  the deathcare industry lacks uniform standards for the delivery of services 
we are committed to elevating service standards and to building a culture of disciplined consistency across our network of businesses 
we believe the key to raising standards is to attract  develop and retain a superior team of people 
sci continues to create and implement programs that enhance its standing as an employer of choice 
in  we established dignity university tm  a virtual school for sci employees at all levels 
it offers a rigorous and comprehensive curriculum of professional development and ethics training and is designed to help employees upgrade skills  advance their careers and uphold high standards 
during  more than  sci employees took and completed over  dignity university tm course sessions  including members of senior management 
building a reputation for consistency and service excellence will continue to set sci apart from competitors 
financial strength and flexibility sci has the financial strength and flexibility to reward shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while maintaining a prudent capital structure and pursuing new opportunities for profitable growth 
since  the company has reduced total debt from more than billion to billion at the end of in  sci produced more than million in operating cash flow  and  at year end  the company had nearly million in cash 
since august  sci has invested more than million in repurchasing its stock and has instituted a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
we have made and intend to make purchases from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to acceptable market conditions and normal trading restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to buy our common stock under our share repurchase programs 
important factors that could cause us not to continue to repurchase our shares include  among others  unfavorable market conditions  the market price of our common stock  the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time  and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing common stock 
the company expects to use its substantial cash and operating cash flow to invest in the business for future growth  to make acquisitions if available at reasonable prices  and to continue to return value to shareholders 
strong preneed backlog sci s financial stability is further enhanced by its current billion backlog of future revenues  the result of preneed funeral and cemetery sales in north america 
these unfulfilled preneed contracts are primarily supported by investments in trust funds  which are included in sci s consolidated balance sheet  and in third party insurance policies  which are not included 
preneed sales not only contribute to profitability and volume  they increase the predictability and stability of our revenues and cash flow 
over the past three years  sci has placed increasing emphasis on preneed sales by improving sales training  certification and compensation practices and by redesigning product and service offerings to meet changing customer preferences 
demographic factors and cremation trend demographic factors approximately percent of all deaths in the united states occur at ages and older 
in people aged and older constituted percent of the population  according to the us census bureau  by it is expected that the number of americans aged and older will exceed 
table of contents percent of the population 
we believe these demographic trends will provide a growing demand in the future for our services on both an atneed and preneed basis 
nevertheless  the number of annual deaths in north america is expected to remain relatively constant for at least another decade because of healthier lifestyles and improved medical care 
in life expectancy in the united states reached years  compared with years in  according to the national center for health statistics 
sci s near term strategies do not anticipate any increase in the number of deaths 
rather  they are designed to increase volume and profitability at existing businesses and to grow through the construction of new properties or through the resumption of disciplined acquisition activities 
the trend toward cremation increasing numbers of consumers now prefer cremation to interment 
we believe that the trend toward cremation presents a significant business opportunity for our company especially since research shows that most people choosing cremation do so for reasons unrelated to cost 
sci is a leading provider of cremation services in north america  with cremation representing approximately percent of our funeral services a rate that is increasing each year 
we intend to continue building our cremation volume by offering better and more personalized products and services 
cremation has traditionally hurt industry profit margins because it depresses casket sales and because many customers who choose cremation may also decide against purchasing cemetery property 
we believe we can improve revenue and profit trends associated with cremation services by realigning our pricing model to customers preferences as discussed further below in focus on profitable growth 
sci s past history and transformation beginning in the late s  sci chairman and founder robert l 
waltrip began consolidating funeral homes and cemeteries  creating the first publicly traded deathcare company by the end of the next decade 
sci continued to expand over the next four decades  primarily by acquiring and consolidating independently owned funeral homes and cemeteries 
continuing through the s  other companies joined in this consolidation trend and competition to buy independent funeral homes and cemetery properties intensified 
acquisition prices escalated sharply and returns on invested capital decreased  as the publicly traded deathcare companies placed more focus on acquiring properties rather than on integrating and managing efficiently 
by  sci owned and operated more than  deathcare businesses in twenty countries  and also owned two insurance companies 
in the late s  sci s operating performance deteriorated and its financial leverage increased dramatically  as did that of its competitors 
sci then ceased its acquisition activities and embarked on initiatives to improve operations and strengthen its balance sheet 
these initiatives included the divestiture of underperforming and non strategic assets  significant reduction of debt  and intense focus on generating strong  stable operating cash flows 
by december   sci had sold or closed most operations outside north america  and had also sold its insurance companies 
by the end of  we had reduced our total debt to billion from billion at the end of in north america  the number of funeral homes and cemeteries has been reduced to  from  in although these asset sales resulted in sci s annual revenues declining from more than billion in to approximately billion in  operating cash flow during this same period continued to improve 
our focus on rapid growth through acquisitions resulted in an expensive and redundant infrastructure that impeded greater efficiencies 
in late  however  we began redesigning our infrastructure with standardized technologies and process improvements 
we have redesigned our sales organization  improved business  financial and purchasing processes  and outsourced many of our accounting  information technology and trust administration functions 
we also implemented a new information system in field locations  replacing the three separate contract entry systems previously used 

table of contents with this streamlined infrastructure in place  we also made significant improvements in field management 
field management previously consisted of separate sales and operating organizations  each with different incentive systems and multiple layers of management 
our newly integrated management structure assigns a single business manager to each region  with the authority and accountability for producing favorable operating and financial results 
we continue to search for additional efficiencies and believe there is still room for further improvement 
administrative and financial functions are now handled by support centers in houston  miami  new york and los angeles  reducing costs and allowing our field managers to focus on improving profitability and developing people 
these four support centers also facilitate implementation of corporate strategies  policies and procedures 
focus on profitable growth in recent years  we have strengthened our balance sheet  lowered our cost structure  introduced more efficient systems and processes and reinvigorated our management team 
as a result  we have created a new foundation for growth that enhances both operating margins and operating cash flow 
over the next several years  we believe there are significant opportunities to achieve profitable growth 
in the short term  we believe we can grow by using more centralization and standardization to take advantage of our scale and by aligning preneed and pricing strategies with customer segments and our competitive advantages 
over the longer term  we believe that the aging of the baby boom generation will create expanding opportunities for an industry leader with superior brand  reputation  financial strength and geographic reach 
we believe we can tailor our business approach by customer segment and expand in the customer segments in which we excel 
approach the business by customer segment 
we are replacing the industry s traditional one size fits all approach with a flexible operating and marketing strategy that categorizes customers according to personal needs and preferences 
using this new approach  sci will tailor its product and service offerings based on four broad variables convenience and location religious and ethnic customs quality and prestige  and price by identifying these customer bases  sci can focus its resources on the most profitable customer segments and improve its marketing effectiveness 
we will continue to refine our pricing  product and marketing strategies to support this approach 
understanding customer attitudes and preferences is essential to our business  and we continue to invest in research 
we began tracking customer satisfaction in our funeral businesses in  using independent surveys sent to each family three weeks after the funeral 
more than percent of these surveys are completed and returned 
these surveys allow us to closely track customer satisfaction with each sci location 
survey results help us to identify weaknesses  share best practices and refine our training 
in  we introduced an enhanced survey program conducted by jd power and associates  a premier marketing firm specializing in customer satisfaction 
the jd power survey is being used with both funeral and cemetery customers 
in  more than percent of our respondents indicated that they were likely to recommend our services to others 
align pricing with customer wants and needs 
sci and the deathcare industry have historically generated most of their profits from the sale of traditional products including caskets  vaults  and markers  while placing less emphasis on the services involved in funeral and burial preparation despite the high 
table of contents personnel and service costs incurred to perform these services 
this pricing model has been challenged in recent years by retail outlets and websites specializing in the sale of these traditional products at substantially reduced prices 
additionally  this emphasis on traditional products has contributed to lower revenue and gross profits for cremation services as most cremation consumers do not purchase traditional deathcare products 
we are currently in the process of realigning pricing in each of our regions from products to service offerings  reflecting our competitive advantage and what customers value 
by the end of  sci had realigned pricing in of our regions  and we expect to complete the process in our remaining regions by the end of our initial results in these regions have been favorable as evidenced by increases in the overall average revenue per funeral service and improved customer satisfaction ratings 
we are confident that our new pricing strategies will succeed as we believe customers are less focused on products and more concerned with our ability to create a personally meaningful funeral service and to help them with the many details surrounding a death 
drive operating discipline and take advantage of our scale 
although we have already made substantial improvements to our infrastructure  we believe we can benefit from more centralization and standardization to take advantage of our scale 
we believe there is room for improvement in our daily operating activities including staffing  central care  fleet management  and cemetery maintenance 
we are developing clear  yet flexible  operating standards that will be used as benchmarks for productivity in these areas 
in conjunction with these standards  we will develop and track shared best practices to support higher productivity 
we intend to continue to capitalize on our nationwide network of properties by pursuing combined affinity relationships 
our most strategic affinity partnerships today are with the veterans of foreign wars and ladies auxiliary whose combined membership exceeds two million 
over the longer term  we believe such groups can be a key influence in the funeral home selection process 
lastly  we will continue to pursue opportunities to more fully utilize our purchasing power 
with enhanced systems  we are better able to track and analyze how and where purchase decisions are made 
manage and grow the footprint 
sci is systematically categorizing the regions surrounding each of our locations according to the customer segmentation variables discussed above 
we are positioning each business location to support the preferences of its local customer base while monitoring the region for changing demographics and competitive dynamics 
as prices for independent funeral homes and cemeteries continue to decline from the excessive levels of the s  sci intends to resume its acquisition activities  using disciplined guidelines 
future business expansion whether through construction or acquisition will target the highest return customer segments 
in our funeral home businesses  we will primarily target customers who value quality and prestige and those adhering to specific religious and ethnic customs 
in our cemetery business  we will focus expansion efforts on large cemeteries that are or may be combined with funeral home operations 
with our industry leadership  geographic reach and financial strength  we are well positioned to achieve profitable growth for our shareholders while delivering superior service and peace of mind to an expanding customer base 
critical accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements and accounting changes our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date 
actual results could differ from such estimates due to uncertainties associated with the methods and assumptions underlying our critical accounting measurements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition  preneed funeral and cemetery contracts  the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the use of estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our trade receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas 
under sfas  revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of unconstructed cemetery property is deferred until it is constructed and of the sales price is collected 
when a customer enters into a preneed funeral trust contract  the entire purchase price is deferred and the revenue is recognized at the time of maturity 
the revenues associated with a preneed cemetery contract  however  may be recognized as different contract events occur 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property are recognized when a minimum of of the sales price has been collected and the property has been constructed or is available for interment 
for personalized marker merchandise  with the customer s direction generally obtained at the time of sale  we can choose to order  store  and transfer title to the customer 
upon the earlier of vendor storage of these items or delivery in our cemetery  we recognize the associated revenues and record the cost of sale 
for services and non personalized merchandise such as vaults  we defer the revenues until the services are performed and the merchandise is delivered 
preneed funeral and cemetery activities in addition to selling our products and services to client families at the time of need  we sell price guaranteed preneed funeral and cemetery contracts which provide for future funeral or cemetery services and merchandise 
a preneed arrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral service  cremation service  and or cemetery burial interment right  merchandise or cemetery service to be performed or provided in the future that is  in advance of when needed or preneed 
while some customers may pay for their preneed funeral or cemetery contract in a single payment  most preneed funeral and cemetery contracts are sold on an installment basis over a period of one to seven years 
on these installment contracts  we receive  on average  a down payment at the time of sale of approximately 
we revised our policy for finance charges on preneed cemetery installment contracts in the second half of based on this revision  preneed cemetery installment contracts generally now include a finance charge ranging from to depending on the payment period and state or provincial laws 
unlike cemetery installment contracts  the majority of our preneed funeral installment contracts have not included a finance charge 
after test marketing a finance charge program for preneed funeral trust contracts during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a finance charge program in five core trust states during  which represent approximately of our preneed funeral trust production 
since preneed funeral and cemetery services or merchandise will not be provided until some time in the future  most states and provinces require that all or a portion of the funds collected from customers on preneed funeral and cemetery contracts be paid into merchandise and service trusts until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
in certain situations  where permitted by state or provincial laws  we post a surety bond as financial assurance for a certain amount of the preneed funeral or cemetery contract in lieu of placing funds into trust accounts 
see the financial assurances section for further details on our practice of posting such surety bonds 
alternatively  where allowed  customers may choose to purchase a life insurance or annuity policy from third party insurance companies to fund their preneed funeral 
only certain of these customer funding options may be applicable in any given market we serve 
we do not fund preneed cemetery contracts with insurance policies 
trust funded preneed funeral and cemetery contracts the funds deposited into trust in accordance with various state and provincial laws are invested by independent trustees in accordance with the investment guidelines established by statute or  where the prudent investor rule is applicable  the guidelines established by the investment committee of our board of directors 
the trustees utilize professional investment advisors to select and monitor the money managers that make the individual investment decisions in accordance with the 
table of contents guidelines 
we retain any funds above the amounts required to be deposited into trust accounts and use them for working capital purposes  generally to offset the selling and administrative costs of the preneed programs 
state or provincial law governs the timing of the required deposits into the trust accounts  which generally ranges from five to days after receipt of the funds from the customer 
investment earnings associated with the trust investments are expected to mitigate the inflationary costs of providing the preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of sale 
as a result of the adoption of the revised financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r in  the preneed funeral and cemetery trust assets have been consolidated and are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas 
investment earnings on trust assets are generally accumulated in the trust and distributed as the revenue associated with the preneed funeral or cemetery contract is recognized or cancelled by the customer 
in certain states and provinces  the trusts are allowed to distribute a portion of the investment earnings to us prior to that date 
prior to january   direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sales of trust funded preneed funeral and cemetery contracts were deferred and included in deferred charges and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred selling costs were expensed in proportion to the corresponding revenues when recognized 
other selling costs associated with the sales and marketing of preneed funeral and cemetery contracts eg  lead procurements costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs were expensed as incurred 
beginning january   we made an accounting change to expense as incurred all direct selling costs associated with the sales of trust funded preneed funeral and cemetery contracts 
if a preneed funeral or cemetery contract is cancelled prior to delivery  state or provincial law determines the amount of the refund owed to the customer  if any  including the amount of the attributed investment earnings 
upon cancellation  we receive the amount of principal deposited to trust and previously undistributed net investment earnings and  where required  issue a refund to the customer 
we retain excess funds  if any  and recognize the attributed investment earnings net of any investment earnings payable to the customer as revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
in certain jurisdictions  we may be obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer exceed the funds in trust 
based on our historical experience  we have included a cancellation reserve for preneed funeral and cemetery contracts in our consolidated balance sheet of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the cash flow activity over the life of a trust funded preneed funeral or cemetery contract from the date of sale to its recognition or cancellation is captured in the line item net effect of preneed funeral or cemetery production and maturities deliveries and net income loss in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
while the contract is outstanding  cash flow is provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and any distributed investment earnings 
prior to january   this amount was reduced by the payment of preneed deferred selling costs 
the effect of amortizing preneed deferred selling costs was reflected in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
effective january   the payment of direct selling costs associated with trust funded preneed contracts is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from operating activities in the line item net income loss  since such direct selling costs are expensed as incurred 
at the time of death maturity  we receive the principal and undistributed investment earnings from the funeral trust and any remaining receivable due from the customer 
at the time of delivery or storage of cemetery merchandise and service items for which we were required to deposit funds to trust  we receive the principal and undistributed investment earnings from the cemetery trust 
there is generally no remaining receivable due from the customer  as our policy is to deliver preneed cemetery merchandise and service items only upon payment of the contract balance in full 
this cash flow at the time of service  delivery or storage is generally less than the associated revenue recognized  thus reducing cash flow from operating activities 

table of contents the tables below detail the north america results of trust funded preneed funeral and cemetery production for the years ended december  and the increase in preneed funeral trust production in relates primarily to a significant shift from the sale of insurance contracts to trust contracts in california and colorado

these general agency commissions ga revenues are based on a percentage per contract sold and are recognized as funeral revenues when the insurance purchase transaction between the customer and third party insurance provider is completed 
direct selling costs incurred pursuant to the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are expensed as incurred 
the policy amount of the insurance contract between the customer and the third party insurance company generally equals the amount of the preneed funeral contract 
however  we do not reflect the unfulfilled insurance funded preneed funeral contract amounts in our consolidated balance sheet 
the third party insurance company collects funds related to the insurance contract directly from the customer 
the life insurance contracts include increasing death benefit provisions  which are expected to offset the inflationary costs of providing the preneed funeral services and merchandise in the future for the prices that were guaranteed at the time of the preneed sale 
these death benefits payable by third party insurance companies increase annually pursuant to the terms of the life insurance policies purchased in advance of need by our customers to fund their funerals 
the customer policy holder assigns the policy benefits to our funeral home to pay for the preneed funeral contract at the time of need 
approximately of our north america preneed funeral production is insurance funded preneed funeral contracts 
additionally  we may receive cash overrides based on achieving certain dollar volume targets of life insurance policies sold as a result of marketing agreements entered into in connection with the sale of our

if a customer cancels the insurance funded preneed funeral contract prior to death  the insurance company pays the cash surrender value under the insurance policy directly to the customer 
if the contract was outstanding for less than one year  the insurance company generally charges back the ga revenues and overrides we received on the contract 
an allowance for these charge backs is included in the consolidated balance sheet based on our historical charge back experience totaling million and million in and  respectively 
because insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  the cash flow activity associated with these contracts generally occurs only at the time of sale and at death or cancellation  and is recorded as cash flows from operating activities within our funeral segment 
upon execution of the contract  the ga revenues and overrides received net of the direct selling costs provide a net source of cash flow 
if the insurance contract cancels within one year following the date of sale  our cash flow is reduced by the charge back of ga revenues and overrides 
at death maturity  the insurance funded preneed funeral contracts are included in funeral trade accounts receivable and funeral revenues when the funeral service is performed 
proceeds from the life insurance policies are used to satisfy the receivables due 
the insurance proceeds which include the increasing death benefit less the funds used to provide the funeral goods and services provide a net source of cash flow 
the table below details the north america results of insurance funded preneed funeral production for the years ended december  and  and the number of contracts associated with that net production 
in  we began charging back preneed funeral insurance production for all cancellations of contracts greater than one year old 
previously  only cancellations less than one year were charged back as the related ga revenue was forfeited 
these charge backs amounted to million in the decrease in preneed funeral insurance production in relates to the change related to cancellations coupled with a significant shift from the sale of insurance contracts to trust contracts in california and colorado

impairment or disposal of long lived assets we test for impairment of goodwill using a two step approach as prescribed in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we do not record an impairment of goodwill in instances where the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
the second step of our goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in such instances  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill as defined in sfas to its carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair market value of a reporting unit is determined using a calculation based on multiples of revenue and multiples of ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  of both sci and its competitors 
based on our impairment tests at september  and september   we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be held and used are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
in november  we sold cemeteries and six funeral homes to stonemor partners lp 
in the third quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell these locations and classified these properties as held for sale 
pursuant to our impairment policy under sfas  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our cemetery segment and million in our funeral segment 
during the second quarter of  we committed to a plan to divest our funeral and cemetery operations in argentina and uruguay 
upon this triggering event  in june  we tested these operations for impairment in accordance with sfas as a result of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million in our second quarter consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had no recorded goodwill associated with argentina and uruguay 
as a result  we did not perform a sfas test in for these operations 
in january  we classified the france operating assets held for sale and ceased depreciation 
in  we sold our funeral operations in france and then purchased a equity interest in the total equity capital of the newly formed entity 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date 
actual results could differ from such estimates due to uncertainties associated with the methods and assumptions underlying our critical accounting measurements 
key estimates used by management  among others  include allowances we provide various allowances and or cancellation reserves for our funeral and cemetery preneed and at need receivables  as well as for our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery deferred revenues 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical trends and include  where applicable  collection and cancellation activity 
after days  atneed funeral receivables are considered 
table of contents past due 
collections are managed by the locations until a receivable is days delinquent  at which time it is written off and sent to a collection agency 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in economy  relocation  and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
where quoted market prices are not available  we obtain estimates of fair value from the managers of the private equity funds  which are based on the market value of the underlying real estate and private equity investments 
these market values are based on contract offers for the real estate or the managers appraisals of the venture capital funds 
legal liability reserves contingent liabilities  principally for legal liability matters  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive verdicts do occur 
as disclosed in note thirteen of the consolidated financial statements  the company s legal exposures and the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings could be material to operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year 
depreciation of long lived assets we depreciate our long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
these estimates of useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions or changes in regulatory requirements 
income taxes our ability to realize the benefit of certain of our deferred tax assets requires us to achieve certain future earnings levels 
we have established a valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from our current estimates 
we intend to permanently reinvest the unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries in those businesses outside the united states and  therefore  have not provided for deferred federal income taxes on such unremitted foreign earnings 
a number of years may elapse before particular tax matters  for which we have established accruals  are audited and finally resolved 
the number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
in the united states  the internal revenue service is currently examining our tax returns for through and various state jurisdictions are auditing years through while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would reduce a deferred tax asset or require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense reported in the financial statements in the future 
our tax accruals are presented in the balance sheet within deferred income taxes and other liabilities 
pension cost our pension plans are frozen with no benefits accruing to participants except interest 
our pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions  including the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
on january   we changed our method of accounting for gains and losses on pension assets and obligations to recognize such gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations during the year in which they occur 
therefore  in and  the concept of an expected rate of return on plan assets is not applicable 
in and prior years  it was our policy to use an expected rate for return on assets comparable to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the company s pension benefits 
we used a assumed rate of return on plan assets in as a result of a high allocation of equity securities within the plan assets 

table of contents discount rates used to determine pension obligations for our pension plans were  and for the years ended   and  respectively 
we base the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations using an analysis of expected future benefit payments 
we verify the reasonableness of the discount rate by comparing our rate to the rate earned on high quality fixed income investments  such as the moody s aa index  high quality fixed income investments 
at december   of our plan assets were invested in core diversified and market neutral hedge funds  of the plan assets were invested in equity securities and the remaining of plan assets were fixed income securities 
as of december   the equity securities were invested approximately in us large cap investments  in international equities and in us small cap investments 
in connection with a million infusion of funds into our plan in early  we rebalanced the plan assets to have a lower percentage invested in traditional equity securities and fixed income securities and instead incorporate investments into hedge funds 
we believe that over time this reallocation will reduce the volatility and limit the negative impact of our investment returns 
a sensitivity analysis of the net periodic benefit cost was modeled to assess the impact that changing discount rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a adverse change to the discount rate with all other variables held constant 
using this model  our pretax earnings would have decreased by million  or less than 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  see note fifteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more information related to our pension plans 
insurance loss reserves we purchase comprehensive general liability  morticians and cemetery professional liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured with high deductibles 
this high deductible insurance program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates a high degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with casualty insurance claims 
this is especially true with respect to liability and workers compensation exposures due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages and falling within the deductible of each coverage through the use of qualified and independent actuaries 
assumptions based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness will generally effect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these actuarial evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust our insurance loss reserves 
our independent actuaries used five actuarial methods generally accepted by the casualty actuarial society to arrive at an estimate of a range that we refer to as reasonably possible 
the actuarial standard of practice no 
asop published by the american academy of actuaries states a range of reasonable estimates is a range of estimates that could be produced by appropriate actuarial methods or alternative sets of assumptions that the actuary judges to be reasonable 
methods used to determine the company s reasonably possible range are paid and incurred loss development methods  frequency severity methods  and paid and incurred bornhuetter ferguson methods 
all of these methods were used to determine our reasonably possible range of insurance loss reserves for the years ended december   and we have not changed our methodologies for determining the reasonably possible range  however  there are changes made to the assumptions as the loss development factors are updated 
these loss development factors are determined based on our historical loss development data and are updated annually as new data becomes available 
as a result  the loss development factors used in the december  analysis could be different from the loss development factors used in the december  analysis 
we consider these changes in loss development factors synonymous to changes in assumptions 
the final loss estimate is not determined by weighting the methodologies  but instead is subjectively arrived at by our independent actuary considering the relative merits of the various methods and the truncated average of the various methods 

table of contents for each loss type workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability loss triangles are generated  which show the cumulative valuation of each loss period over time 
the loss components evaluated include incurred losses  paid losses  reported claim counts  and average incurred loss 
the actuarial analysis of losses uses this data to estimate future loss development or settlement value of the losses 
since these loss development factors are an estimate about future loss development  the calculation of ultimate losses is also an estimate 
the actual ultimate loss value may not be known for many years  and may differ significantly from the estimated value of the ultimate losses 
as of december   reported losses within our retention for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability incurred during the period may  through december  were approximately million 
the selected fully developed ultimate settlement value estimated by our independent actuary was million 
paid losses were million indicating a reserve requirement of million 
after considering matters discussed with our independent actuary related to this calculation  we estimated the reserve to be million as of december  at december  and  the balances in the reserve and the related activity were as follows dollars in millions balance at december  additions payments balance at december  additions payments balance at december  our independent actuary performed a sensitivity analysis that was modeled to assess the impact of changes to the reserve pertaining to workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the loss development factors as summarized below 
sensitivity analysis dollars in millions workers compensation general liability auto liability total sensitivity the loss development factors used in the december  calculation are based on the company s actual claim history by policy year for the period beginning may  may  recent accounting pronouncements and accounting changes accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

deferred selling costs effective january   we changed our method of accounting for direct selling costs related to the acquisition of preneed funeral and preneed cemetery contracts 
prior to this change  we capitalized such direct selling costs and amortized these deferred selling costs in proportion to the revenue recognized 
under our new method of accounting  we expense these direct selling costs as incurred 
we believe the new method is preferable because it better reflects the economics of our business 
as of january   we recorded a cumulative effect charge of million  net of tax of million 
this amount represents the cumulative balance of deferred selling costs recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in deferred charges and other assets at the time of the accounting change 
if we had not changed our method of accounting for direct selling costs as described above  net income for the year ended december  would have been approximately million or 
per basic and diluted share higher than currently reported 

table of contents the pro forma amounts for the years ended december  and in the table below reflect our new policy to expense selling costs as incurred

 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
we will continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our stock options 
we have adopted sfas r on january  and will use the modified prospective transition method 
we have calculated our historical pool of windfall tax benefits by comparing the book expense for individual stock grants and the related tax deduction for options granted after january  additionally  adjustments were made to exclude windfall tax benefits which were not realized due to our net operating loss position 
we have completed this calculation and have determined an additional paid in capital pool of approximately million 
the adoption of sfas r is expected to negatively impact our after tax earnings by approximately million or

see note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information related to our stock based compensation plans 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fin this interpretation clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fin under the provisions of fin r  we are required to consolidate certain cemeteries and trust assets 
merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts are considered variable interest entities because the trusts meet the conditions of paragraphs a and b of fin r 
that is  as a group  the equity investors if any do not have sufficient equity at risk and do not have the direct or indirect ability through voting or similar rights to make decisions about the trusts activities that have a significant effect on the success of the trusts 
fin r requires us to consolidate merchandise and service trusts and cemetery perpetual care trusts for which we are the primary beneficiary ie  those for which we absorb a majority of the trusts expected losses 
we are the primary beneficiary of a trust whenever a majority of the assets of the trust are attributable to deposits of our customers 
we implemented fin r as of march  prior to the implementation  we operated certain cemeteries in michigan which we managed but did not own 
during our evaluation of fin r  we evaluated these cemeteries to determine whether such cemeteries were within the scope of fin r 
the investment capital of these cemeteries was financed by the company in exchange for a long term sales  accounting  and cash management agreement 
in accordance with this agreement  we receive the majority of the cash flows from these cemeteries 
additionally  we absorb the majority of these cemeteries expected losses and receive a majority of the cemeteries residual returns 
as a result  we concluded that we were the primary beneficiary of these cemeteries and that the long term sales  accounting  and cash management agreement is a variable interest as defined by fin r 
given the circumstances above  we consolidated such cemeteries as of march  we recognized an after tax charge of million  representing the cumulative effect of an accounting change  as a result of consolidating these cemeteries 
the results of operations and cash flows of these cemeteries are included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows beginning march  excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change  the effect of consolidating these entities did not have a significant impact on our reported results of operations 
pension plans effective january   we changed our accounting for gains and losses on our pension plan assets and obligations 
we now recognize pension gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations as such gains and losses are incurred under pension accounting 
prior to january   we amortized the difference between actual and expected investment returns and actuarial gains and losses over seven years except to the extent that settlements with employees required earlier recognition 
we believe the new method of accounting better reflects the economic nature of our pension plans and recognize gains and losses on the pension plan assets and obligations in the year the gains or losses occur 
as a result of this accounting change  we recognized a cumulative effect charge of an accounting change of million net of tax as of january  this amount represented accumulated unrecognized net losses related to our pension plan assets and liabilities 
under our new accounting policy  we record net pension expense or income reflecting estimated returns on plan assets and obligations for our interim financial statements  and we recognize actual 
table of contents gains and losses on plan assets and obligations for our full year annual financial statements as actuarial information becomes available upon review of the annual remeasurement 
see note fifteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on pensions

funeral volume north america comparable funeral volume increased in compared to this increase included a increase in cremations and a relatively stable number of traditional interments which resulted from increased volume due  in part  to marketing initiatives implemented in the funeral volumes of sci s comparable locations in north america were less in than in we believe these results are better than or consistent with those reported by other companies in the funeral service and casket manufacturing industries and that they are primarily reflective of the number of deaths in our regions 
over time  we believe the decline in the number of deaths will stabilize because of the aging population

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources capital allocation considerations since  sci has gained significant financial flexibility by reducing debt and improving cash flow 
our primary financial focus for the future will be on funding disciplined growth initiatives that generate increased profitability  revenues and cash flow margins 
first  we believe we can use capital productively by re investing in our existing businesses 
these capital investments may include the construction of high end cemetery property such as private family estates and the construction of funeral home facilities on company owned cemeteries 
second  we believe that the acquisition of additional deathcare operations can leverage our scale and capabilities if the expected returns exceed our cost of capital 
third  a financial priority is to continue returning cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends 
since august  sci has repurchased million of its shares at an average price of  for a total of million 
our board has currently authorized an additional million for share repurchases 
we have made and intend to make purchases from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to acceptable market conditions and normal trading restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to buy our common stock under our share repurchase programs 
important factors that could cause us not to continue to repurchase our shares include  among others  unfavorable market conditions  the market price of our common stock  the nature of other investment opportunities presented to us from time to time  and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing common stock 
since early  sci has paid shareholders a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share 
while we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future  all subsequent dividends are subject to final determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our financial performance 
we currently consider our company under leveraged relative to companies in other industries with similar growth characteristics 
therefore  our focus is not currently on debt reduction 
sci s near term maturities are minimal  with less than million cumulative through the end of we expect to make these scheduled debt payments through from cash flow generated by the company 
we believe that we have adequate resources to meet our near and intermediate term debt obligations  our planned capital expenditures  and other cash requirements  as well as to have funds available for future growth 

table of contents cash flow we believe our ability to generate strong operating cash flow is one of our fundamental financial strengths and provides us with substantial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs 
highlights of cash flow for the year ended december  compared to the same periods of and are as follows operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased by million to million in compared to the cash flows from operating activities of million declined by million as compared to the operating cash flows in included in was a federal income tax refund of million

included in was a tax refund of million and disbursements of million net of insurance recoveries related to the resolution of certain litigation matters 
in addition to the items mentioned above  the increase in operating cash flows in as compared to is the result of an extra bi weekly cash payroll payment of approximately million in  an approximate million decrease in bonus payments  an increase in net trust withdrawals  and a million decrease in cash interest paid

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commercial and contingent commitments we have assumed various financial obligations and commitments in the ordinary course of conducting our business 
we have contractual obligations requiring future cash payments under existing contractual arrangements  such as debt maturities  interest on long term debt  and employment  consulting and non competition agreements 
we also have commercial and contingent obligations that result in cash payments only if certain contingent events occur requiring our performance pursuant to a funding commitment 
the following table details our known future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total dollars in millions current maturities of long term debt long term debt maturities interest obligation on long term debt casket purchase agreement operating lease agreements employment  consulting and non competition agreements total contractual obligations our outstanding indebtedness contains standard provisions  such as payment delinquency default clauses and change of control clauses 
in addition  our bank credit agreement contains a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
see note ten to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details of our long term debt 
we have executed a purchase agreement with a major casket manufacturer for our north america operations with an original minimum commitment of million  covering a six year period that expired in the agreement contained provisions for annual price adjustments and provided for a one year extension to december   which we elected to extend in order to satisfy our commitment 
in january  we again amended the original purchase agreement to allow us to continue purchasing caskets through  subject to price increase limitations 
at december   our remaining casket purchase commitment under the agreement was million 
see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details related to this purchase agreement 
the majority of our operating leases contain options to i purchase the property at fair value on the exercise date  ii purchase the property for a value determined at the inception of the leases  or iii renew for the fair rental value at the end of the primary lease term 
our operating leases primarily relate to funeral service locations  automobiles  limousines  hearses  cemetery operating and maintenance equipment and two aircraft 
we have residual value exposures related to certain operating leases of approximately million 
we believe it is unlikely that we will have to make future cash payments related to these residual value exposures 
in order to eliminate the variable interest rate risk in the company s operating margins and improve the transparency of our financial statements  we amended certain of our transportation lease agreements subsequent to december  based on the amended terms  these leases have been converted from operating leases to capital leases for accounting purposes in see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details related to leases 
we have entered into management employment  consulting and non competition agreements which contractually require us to make cash payments over the contractual period 
the agreements have been primarily entered into with certain officers and employees of the company and former owners of businesses acquired 
the contractual obligation amounts pertain to the total commitment outstanding under these agreements and may not be indicative of future expenses to be incurred related to these 
table of contents agreements due to cost rationalization programs completed by the company 
agreements with contractual periods less than one year are excluded 
see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional details related to these agreements 
we have not included amounts in this table for payments of pension contributions and payments for various postretirement welfare plans and postemployment benefit plans  as such amounts have not been determined beyond the following table details our known potential or possible future cash payments on an undiscounted basis related to various commercial and contingent obligations as of december  expiration by period commercial and contingent obligations thereafter total dollars in millions surety obligations letters of credit representations and warranties income distributions from trust total commercial and contingent obligations to support our operations  we have engaged certain surety companies to issue surety bonds on our behalf for customer financial assurance or as required by state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are primarily obtained to provide assurance for our preneed funeral and preneed cemetery obligations  which are appropriately presented as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred preneed funeral contract revenues and deferred cemetery contract revenues 
the total outstanding surety bonds at december  were million 
of this amount  million was related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery obligations 
when we use surety bonds for preneed funeral and cemetery obligations  the bond amount required is based on the calculated trusting requirements as if the contract was paid in full at the time of sale 
when we deposit funds into state mandated trust funds  however  the amount deposited is generally based on the amount of cash received and payment application rules in the state trust requirements 
therefore  in the event all of the surety companies canceled or did not renew our outstanding surety bonds  which are generally renewed for twelve month periods  we would be required to either obtain replacement assurance or fund approximately million  as of december   primarily into state mandated trust accounts 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
we are occasionally required to post letters of credit  issued by a financial institution  to secure certain insurance programs or other obligations 
letters of credit generally authorize the financial institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation 
the letters of credit are generally posted for one year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the letter of credit 
we are obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary collects on the letter of credit 
we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to fund a claim under our outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the full amount of the letters of credit was supported by our credit facility which expires august 
table of contents in addition to the letters of credit described above  we currently have contingent obligations of million related to our asset sale and joint venture transactions 
we have agreed to guarantee certain representations and warranties associated with such disposition transactions with letters of credit or interest bearing cash investments 
we have interest bearing cash investments of million included in deferred charges and other assets pledged as collateral for certain of these contingent obligations 
we do not believe we will ultimately be required to fund to third parties any claims against these representations and warranties 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of contractual obligations related to representations and warranties associated with the disposition of our funeral operations in france 
the remaining obligations of million at december  is primarily related to taxes and certain litigation matters 
this amount is recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note nineteen to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for addition information related to the disposition of our french operations 
in certain states and provinces  we have withdrawn allowable distributable earnings including unrealized gains prior to the maturity or cancellation of the related contract 
in the event of market declines  we may be required to re deposit portions or all of these amounts into the respective trusts in some future period 
financial assurances in support of our operations  we have entered into arrangements with certain surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on our behalf as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been used to support our preneed funeral and cemetery sales activities 
the obligations underlying these surety bonds assure are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred preneed funeral revenues and deferred preneed cemetery revenues 
the breakdown of surety bonds between funeral and cemetery preneed arrangements  as well as surety bonds for other activities  are described below 
the decrease in preneed funeral and preneed cemetery surety bonds is primarily the result of the completion of pre construction projects  divested locations  and a change in the type of sales in florida 
december  december  dollars in millions preneed funeral preneed cemetery merchandise and services pre construction bonds supporting preneed funeral and cemetery obligations bonds supporting preneed business permits other bonds total surety bonds outstanding when selling preneed funeral and cemetery contracts  we may post surety bonds where allowed by state law  except as noted below for florida 
we post the surety bonds in lieu of trusting a certain amount of funds received from the customer 
the amount of the bond posted is generally determined by the total amount of the preneed contract that would otherwise be required to be trusted  in accordance with applicable state law 
for the year ended december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash receipts attributable to bonded sales 
these amounts do not consider reductions associated with taxes  obtaining costs  or other costs 
surety bond premiums are paid annually and are automatically renewable until maturity of the underlying preneed contracts  unless we are given prior notice of cancellation 
except for cemetery pre construction bonds which are irrevocable  the surety companies generally have the right to cancel the surety bonds at any time with appropriate notice 
in the event a surety company was to cancel the surety bond  we are required to obtain replacement surety assurance from another surety company or fund a trust for an amount 
table of contents generally less than the posted bond amount 
management does not expect it will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds because of lack of surety capacity 
the applicable florida law that allowed posting of surety bonds for preneed contracts expired december   however  it allowed for preneed contracts entered into prior to december  to continue to be bonded for the remaining life of those contracts 
of the total cash receipts attributable to bonded sales for the years ended december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  were attributable to the state of florida 
on february   we elected to begin trusting as a financial assurance mechanism in florida  rather than surety bonding  on new florida sales of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services 
our net trust deposits required in for new florida sales since changing to trust funding were million 
our net trust deposits required during for new trust funded sales were million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes eleven and twelve to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we have historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  and forward exchange contracts in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge our net investment in foreign assets 
we do not participate in derivative transactions that are leveraged or considered speculative in nature 
none of our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes 
all of the instruments described below were entered into for other than trading purposes 
during the third quarter of  we fully hedged an  chilean pesos clp income tax receivable at a forward price of on june  at december   we have marked to market the income tax receivable and the hedge liability at the spot rate of 
the fair market value hedge is effective and resulted in a gain of million  net of a tax provision of million  which is included in income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  there is no foreign exchange rate risk associated with this receivable 
at december  and  of our total debt consisted of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
at december   approximately of our stockholders equity and of our operating income were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
approximately of our stockholders equity and of our operating income were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  at december  we do not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with our preneed funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity and debt securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  are presented in notes four  five and six to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 

table of contents market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of interest rate and exchange rate risks on earnings 
this analysis determines the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical change 
the company is currently not subject to significant interest rate risk on its outstanding debt as of such debt has fixed rate interest terms 
the fair market value of our debt was approximately million more than its carrying value at december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
at december  and  our foreign currency exposure was primarily associated with the canadian dollar  the chilean peso and the euro 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency instruments would have negatively affected our net income excluding discontinued operations  on an annual basis  by less than million on december  and less than million on december
