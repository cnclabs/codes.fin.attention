overview platinum holdings is a bermuda holding company organized in the company operates through its three licensed reinsurance subsidiaries platinum bermuda  platinum us and platinum uk 
the company provides property and marine  casualty and finite risk reinsurance coverages  through reinsurance intermediaries  to a diverse clientele of insurers and select reinsurers on a worldwide basis 
in november  platinum holdings completed the initial public offering 
concurrent with the initial public offering  platinum holdings sold  common shares to st 
paul  and  common shares to renaissancere in private placements 
st 
paul sold its  common shares in june and renaissancere sold its  in december  in each case in public offerings 
as part of the private placements  st 
paul and renaissancere received options to purchase up to  and  of additional common shares  respectively  at any time during the ten years following the initial public offering at a price of per share 
both of these options were subsequently amended to provide that in lieu of paying per share  any option exercise will be settled on a net share basis  which will result in platinum holdings issuing a number of common shares equal to the excess of the market price per share  determined in accordance with the amendments  over  less the par value per share  multiplied by the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the option divided by that market price per share 
also  concurrent with the transactions in november  the company and st 
paul entered into several agreements for the transfer of continuing reinsurance business and certain related assets of st 
paul 
among these agreements were quota share retrocession agreements effective november  under which the company assumed from st 
paul unpaid losses and lae  unearned premiums and certain other liabilities on reinsurance contracts becoming effective in the quota share retrocession agreements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates it is important to understand the company s accounting policies in order to understand its financial position and results of operations 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results since they require management to make estimates and valuation assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
certain of the estimates and assumptions result from judgments that are necessarily subjective and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies involve written and unearned premium  unpaid losses and lae  reinsurance  investments  income taxes and stock based compensation 
premiums assumed reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues when premiums become earned proportionately over the coverage period 
net premiums earned are recorded in the statement of operations  net of the cost of retrocession 
net premiums written not yet recognized as revenue are recorded on the balance sheet as unearned premiums  gross of any ceded unearned premiums 
due to the nature of reinsurance  ceding companies routinely report and remit premiums subsequent to the contract coverage period 
consequently  reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by estimates of premiums that are written but not reported wbnr 
the premium estimation process considers the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts and assumes that the contracts will remain in force until expiration 
the estimation of written premiums could be affected by early cancellation  election of contract provisions for cut off and return of unearned premiums or other contract disruptions 
in addition to estimating wbnr  the company estimates the portion of premiums 
table of contents earned but not reported ebnr 
the company also estimates the expenses associated with these premiums in the form of losses  lae and commissions 
the time lag involved in the process of reporting premiums is shorter than the lag in reporting losses 
premiums are generally reported within two years 
the net impact on the results of operations of changes in estimated earned premiums is reduced by the losses and acquisition expenses related to such premiums 
when estimating premiums written and earned  each of our reinsurance subsidiaries segregates business into classes by type of coverage and type of contract approximately classes 
within each class  business is further segregated by the year in which the contract incepted the underwriting year  starting with estimates of wbnr and ebnr are made for each class and underwriting year 
premiums are estimated based on ceding company estimates and our own judgment after considering factors such as the ceding company s historical premium versus projected premium  the ceding company s history of providing accurate estimates  anticipated changes in the marketplace and the ceding company s competitive position therein  reported premiums to date and the anticipated impact of proposed underwriting changes 
the net impact on the results of operations of changes in estimated earned premiums is reduced by the losses and acquisition expenses related to such earned premiums 
the appropriateness of premium estimates is evaluated in light of the actual premium reported by the ceding companies and any adjustments to these estimates that represent earned premiums are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made 
the initial estimates of premiums derived by our underwriting function in respect of year end were evaluated 
the cumulative impact of our evaluation in respect of premiums receivable as of december  was to reduce premium estimates by approximately million or of reinsurance premiums receivable 
as an illustration  we had one contract that  at december   represented approximately million of our total reinsurance premiums receivable 
with respect to that contract  we reduced reinsurance premiums receivable by approximately million because we did not expect the ceding company to meet its production estimates or to achieve its estimated rate increases 
we believe that we reasonably could have made an adjustment of between and million with respect to that contract at december  had we made a adjustment  the reinsurance premiums receivable for that contract at december  would have been million 
we made the million adjustment  resulting in reinsurance premiums receivable for that contract of million 
while an adjustment of greater than million is possible with respect to that contract  we do not consider such circumstance to be reasonably likely 
reinsurance premiums receivable under a particular contract can vary significantly from estimates derived from our underwriting function depending upon our assessment of the production and rate changes likely to be achieved by the ceding company 
due to the time lag inherent in the reporting of premiums by ceding companies  a significant portion of amounts included as premiums written and premiums earned represents estimated premiums and are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
earned premiums  including ebnr  are a measure of exposure to losses  lae and acquisition expenses 
consequently  when previous estimates of premiums earned are increased or decreased  the related provisions for losses and lae and acquisition costs previously recorded are also increased or decreased 
an allowance for uncollectible premiums is established for possible non payment of such amounts due  as deemed necessary 
as of december   we did not establish an allowance based on our historical experience  the general profile of our ceding companies and our ability in most cases to contractually offset those premium receivables against losses and loss adjustment expense or other amounts payable to the same parties 
certain of the company s reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the loss experience under the contracts 
reinstatement premiums and additional premiums are recognized in accordance with the provisions of assumed reinsurance contracts  based on loss experience under such contracts 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of a reinsurance contract to its full amount  generally coinciding with the payment by the reinsurer of losses 
these premiums relate to the future coverage obtained for the remainder of the initial policy term and are earned over the remaining policy term 
any unearned premium existing at the time a contract limit is exhausted or reinstated is immediately earned 
additional premiums are those premiums 
table of contents triggered by losses and not related to reinstatement of limits and are immediately earned 
an allowance for uncollectible premiums is established for possible non payment of such amounts due  as deemed necessary 
unpaid losses and lae one of the most significant judgments made by management in the preparation of financial statements is the estimation of unpaid losses and lae  also referred to as loss reserves 
unpaid losses and lae include estimates of the cost of claims that were reported but not yet paid case reserves and the cost of claims that were incurred but not reported ibnr 
these liabilities are balance sheet estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and lae for reinsured claims for which we are liable and that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
every quarter  the company s actuaries prepare estimates of the loss reserves based on established actuarial techniques 
because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and lae is uncertain  we believe that the quantitative techniques used to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment 
company management reviews these estimates and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the company s financial statements 
while the company commenced operations in  the business written is sufficiently similar to the historical business of st 
paul re such that the company uses the historical loss experience of this business  which is periodically updated by st 
paul re  to estimate its initial expected ultimate losses and its expected patterns of reported losses 
these patterns can span more than a decade and  given its own limited history  the availability of the st 
paul re data is a valuable asset of the company 
the company does not establish liabilities until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a loss 
when an event of sufficient magnitude occurs  the company may establish a specific ibnr reserve 
generally  this is done following a catastrophe that affects many ceding companies 
ultimate losses and lae are based on management s judgment and reflect estimates gathered from ceding companies  estimates of insurance industry losses gathered from public sources and estimates derived from catastrophe modeling software 
unpaid losses and lae represent management s best estimates  at a given point in time  of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred  and it is possible that the ultimate liability may materially differ from such estimates 
such estimates are not precise due to the fact that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors 
because of the degree of reliance that the company necessarily places on ceding companies for claims reporting  the associated time lag  the low frequency high severity nature of some of the business that the company underwrites and the varying reserving practices among ceding companies  the company s reserve estimates are highly dependent on management judgment and are therefore uncertain 
estimates of unpaid losses and lae are periodically re estimated and adjusted as new information becomes available 
any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made 

table of contents the gross liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and for unpaid losses and lae were  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between case reserves and ibnr by segment at december  and in thousands property and marine casualty finite risk total december  case reserves ibnr total unpaid losses and lae december  case reserves ibnr total unpaid losses and lae case reserves are usually based upon claim reports received from ceding companies 
the information we receive varies by ceding company and may include paid losses  estimated case reserves  and an estimated provision for ibnr reserves 
case reserves may be increased or reduced by our claims personnel based on receipt of additional information  including information received from ceding companies 
ibnr is based on actuarial methods including the loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method and the chain ladder method 
ibnr related to a specific event may be based on our estimated exposure to an industry loss and may include the use of catastrophe modeling software 
generally  initial actuarial estimates of ibnr not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each underwriting year for each class of business 
actual paid losses and case reserves reported losses are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine ibnr 
the initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on i contract by contract expected loss ratios derived from our pricing process  and ii historical loss ratios of the company and st 
paul re adjusted for rate changes and trends 
these judgments will take into account management s view of past  current and future i market conditions  ii changes in the business underwritten  iii changes in timing of the emergence of claims and iv other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported  actuarial estimates of ibnr are based on the bornhuetter ferguson and the chain ladder techniques 
the bornhuetter ferguson technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses  taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses 
the chain ladder technique utilizes actual reported losses and expected patterns of reported losses to determine an estimate of expected ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expected ultimate losses 
this technique is most appropriate when there are a large number of reported losses with significant statistical credibility and a relatively stable pattern of reported losses 
when estimating unpaid losses and lae  each of our reinsurance subsidiaries segregates business into classes by type of coverage and type of contract approximately classes 
within each class the business is further segregated by underwriting year  starting with multiple point estimates using a variety of actuarial techniques are calculated for many  but not all  of our classes of coverage for each underwriting year 
we do not believe that these multiple point estimates are or should be considered a range 
our actuaries consider each class and determine the most appropriate point estimate based on the characteristics of the particular class and other relevant factors such as historical ultimate loss ratios  the presence of individual large losses  and known occurrences that have not yet resulted in reported losses 
for some classes of business our actuaries believe that a review of individual contract information improves the loss reserve estimate 
for example  individual contract review is particularly 
table of contents important for the finite risk segment and the accident and health class within the casualty segment 
once our actuaries make their determinations of the most appropriate point estimate for each class  this information is aggregated and reviewed and approved by executive management 
at december  the liability for unpaid losses and lae that we recorded includes the point estimates of ibnr prepared by our actuaries 
generally  north american casualty excess business has the longest pattern of reported losses and  therefore  loss estimates have a higher degree of uncertainty than other reinsurance classes 
ibnr for these classes at december  was million which was of the total ibnr at that date 
because estimates of unpaid losses and lae related to north american casualty excess business have a higher degree of uncertainty  we would not consider a variance of five percentage points from the initial expected loss ratio to be unusual 
as an example  a change in the initial expected loss ratio from to would result in an increase of the ibnr for these classes by million 
this equates to approximately of the liability for total unpaid losses and lae for these classes at december  as another example  if the estimated pattern of reported losses was accelerated by the ibnr for these classes would decrease by million which is less than 
we have selected these two inputs as examples of sensitivity analyses because we believe that the two most important inputs to the reserve estimation methodologies described above are the initial expected loss ratio and the estimated pattern of reported losses 
the pattern of reported losses is determined utilizing actuarial analysis  including management s judgment  and is based on historical patterns of paid losses and reporting of case reserves to the company  as well as industry patterns 
information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate 
for property and health coverages these patterns indicate that a substantial portion of the ultimate losses are reported within to years after the contract is effective 
casualty patterns can vary from years to over years depending on the type of business 
in property classes  there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events 
with wind events  such as hurricanes  the damage assessment process may take more than a year 
the cost of rebuilding is subject to increase due to supply shortages for construction materials and labor 
in the case of earthquakes  the damage assessment process may take several years as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected 
the uncertainty inherent in loss estimation is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages  such as umbrella liability  general and product liability  professional liability  directors and officers liability and automobile liability  where information  such as required medical treatment and costs for bodily injury claims  emerges over time 
in the overall loss reserving process  provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered 
loss reserve calculations for primary insurance business are not precise in that they deal with the inherent uncertainty of future developments 
primary insurers must estimate their own losses  often based on incomplete and changing information 
reserving for reinsurance business introduces further uncertainties compared with reserving for primary insurance business 
the uncertainty in the reserving process for reinsurers is due  in part  to the time lags inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the reinsurer 
as a predominantly broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts  the company is subject to a potential additional time lag in the receipt of information as the primary insurer reports to the broker who in turn reports to the company 
as of december   we did not have any significant back log related to our processing of assumed reinsurance information 
since we rely on information regarding paid losses  case reserves and ibnr provided by ceding companies in order to assist us in estimating our liability for unpaid losses and lae  we maintain certain procedures in order to help determine the completeness and accuracy of such information 
periodically  management assesses the reporting activities of these companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria 
in addition to conferring with ceding companies or brokers on claims matters  our claims personnel conduct periodic audits of specific claims and the overall claims procedures of our ceding companies at their offices 
we rely on our ability to effectively monitor the claims handling and claims reserving practices of ceding companies in order to help establish the proper reinsurance premium for reinsurance agreements and to establish proper loss reserves 
disputes with ceding companies have been rare and generally have been resolved through negotiation 

table of contents reinsurance premiums written  premiums earned and losses and lae reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions 
reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and ceded transactions when risk transfer requirements have been met 
risk transfer analysis evaluates significant assumptions relating to the amount and timing of expected cash flows  as well as the interpretation of underlying contract terms 
reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk are generally accounted for as reinsurance deposit liabilities with interest expense charged to other income and credited to the liability 
investments in accordance with our investment guidelines  our investment portfolio consists of diversified  high quality  predominantly publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
fixed maturity securities for which we may not have the positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes 
fixed maturity securities for which we have the intent to sell prior to maturity are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in other income and the related deferred income tax included in income tax expense 
securities classified as trading securities are generally denominated in foreign currencies and are intended to match net liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize net exposures arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
investment income is recorded when earned and includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments 
we believe we have the ability to hold any specific security to maturity 
this is based on current and anticipated future positive cash flow from operations that is expected to generate sufficient liquidity in order to meet our obligations 
however  in the course of managing investment credit risk  asset liability duration or other aspects of the investment portfolio  the company may decide to sell any specific security 
the company routinely reviews its available for sale investments to determine whether unrealized losses represent temporary changes in fair value or are the result of other than temporary impairments 
the process of determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired is subjective and involves analyzing many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the overall financial condition of the issuer  the duration and magnitude of an unrealized loss  specific credit events and the company s intent to hold a security for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover the unrealized loss 
if the company has determined that an unrealized loss on a security is other than temporary  the company writes down the carrying value of the security to its current fair value and records a realized loss in the statement of operations 
during  as a result of the routine evaluation of investments  we wrote down the carrying value of our other invested asset to its estimated net realizable value and recorded a realized loss of  other than this adjustment  we do not believe our investment portfolio contains any securities with an unrealized loss that is other than temporary 
income taxes platinum holdings and platinum bermuda are domiciled in bermuda 
under current bermuda law  they are not taxed on any bermuda income or capital gains and they have received an assurance from the bermuda minister of finance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to platinum holdings or platinum bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  the company also has subsidiaries in the united states  united kingdom and ireland that are subject to the tax laws thereof 
we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to 
table of contents taxable income in the years in which the taxes related to those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized

sfas requires that the fair value of shares granted under our share option plan subsequent to adoption of sfas be amortized in earnings over the vesting periods 
the fair value of the share options granted is determined through the use of an option pricing model

the fair value of restricted share awards is determined on the grant date and is amortized into earnings over the vesting period 
there are limits on the transferability of the restricted shares and such restricted shares may be forfeited in the event of certain types of termination of the recipient s employment 
the unearned or unvested portion of the restricted shares issued is presented as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

on april   the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a new rule that allows sec registrants to implement sfas r as of january  the sec s new rule does not change the accounting required by sfas r  it delays the date for compliance with the standard 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that  prospectively  compensation expense be recognized for the fair value of all share options over the vesting period 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of december  will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas adjusted by an allowance for estimated future forfeitures of unvested awards 
we expect to adopt the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective application in the first quarter of sfas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards 
sfas r will not have a material impact upon adoption 
reinsurance industry conditions and trends the reinsurance industry historically has been cyclical  characterized by periods of price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods of favorable pricing due to shortages of underwriting capacity 
cyclical trends in the industry and the industry s profitability can also be significantly affected by volatile developments  including natural and other catastrophes  such as hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions and terrorist attacks  the frequency and severity of which are inherently difficult to predict 
property and casualty reinsurance rates often rise in the aftermath of significant catastrophe losses 
to the extent that actual claim liabilities are higher than anticipated  the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes 
the industry is also affected by changes in the propensity of courts to expand insurance coverage and grant large liability awards  as well as fluctuations in interest rates  inflation and other changes in the economic environment that affect market prices of investments 

table of contents following the large rate increases in and  reinsurers experienced lower rate increases and or rate reductions in certain property and casualty classes in despite the florida and caribbean catastrophe claims in the third quarter of  property rate reductions still occurred as most reinsurers continued to be profitable 
in an unprecedented level of hurricane losses caused many reinsurers to report significant net losses 
many reinsurers were able to raise additional capital in the fourth quarter of and a number of new reinsurers were formed 
nonetheless  the magnitude of the hurricane losses caused rating agencies to tighten capital requirements and both reinsurers and their insurance company clients to reassess their catastrophe pricing and aggregate loss monitoring parameters and procedures 
the result has been an increase in catastrophe pricing  particularly for wind exposures in the us the impact on non catastrophe pricing has been to mitigate the trend towards rate weakening with many markets experiencing an environment of little or no rate change 
we believe that current rates should provide adequate returns 
results of operations year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  net income loss for the years ended december  and was as follows in thousands decrease net income loss the net loss in is due to losses arising from severe hurricanes in the southeastern united states and the caribbean 
in  three significant named hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma the hurricanes  caused severe damage in louisiana  mississippi  texas  florida and several other states in the gulf coast region of the united states as well as mexico and the caribbean 
based on current industry estimates  hurricane katrina is the costliest natural disaster in us history 
in  four significant named hurricanes  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne the hurricanes  caused severe damage in the caribbean and the southeastern united states  principally florida 
as a result of losses arising from these catastrophic events  certain reinsurance contracts generated additional premiums and adjustments to accrued profit commissions

finite risk the finite risk operating segment includes principally structured reinsurance contracts with ceding companies whose needs may not be met efficiently through traditional reinsurance products 
the classes of risks underwritten through finite risk contracts are generally consistent with the classes covered by traditional products 
typically  the amount of losses we might pay is finite or capped 
in return for this limit on losses  we often accept a cap on the potential profit margin specified in the treaty and return profits above this margin to the ceding company 
due to the significant inverse relationship between losses and commissions for this segment  we believe it is important to evaluate the overall combined ratio  rather than its component parts of loss and loss adjustment expense ratios 
the finite risk contracts that we underwrite generally provide prospective protection  meaning coverage is provided for losses that are incurred after inception of the 
table of contents contract  as contrasted with retrospective coverage  which covers losses that are incurred prior to inception of the contract 
the three main categories of finite risk contracts are finite quota share  multi year excess of loss and whole account aggregate stop loss

there are generally no stated amounts related to reinsurance contracts 
both the amounts and timing of future loss and lae payments are estimates and subject to the inherent variability of legal and market conditions affecting the obligations and make the timing of cash outflows uncertain 
the ultimate amount and timing of unpaid losses and lae could differ materially from the amounts in the table above 
further  the gross unpaid losses and lae do not represent all of the obligations that will arise under the contracts  but rather only the estimated liability incurred through december  there are reinsurance contracts that have terms extending into under which additional obligations will be incurred 
current outlook hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma the hurricanes caused significant losses to insurers and reinsurers during the third and fourth quarters of following these events  rating agencies strengthened the capital requirements for companies with catastrophe exposures 
many reinsurers added capital through equity and debt offerings  but some saw their financial strength ratings downgraded in any case 
in contrast  our am best rating of a excellent was affirmed  which we believe strengthened our relative position in the marketplace 
a number of new bermuda based reinsurance companies were formed after the hurricanes 
we believe that most of these companies were in the process of assembling their underwriting staff and 
table of contents establishing their market presence during the renewal season for contracts effective on january  the january renewal season 
the january renewal season is generally considered the most significant underwriting period of the year for the reinsurance industry 
we believe the january renewal season was more contentious than usual 
we experienced account turnover across all lines of business 
however  terms and conditions on most of our renewed treaties improved or remained substantially unchanged depending on the line of business 
we expect these conditions to continue during  but the competitive landscape is still evolving and the depth and breadth of market changes for the balance of remain uncertain 
for the property and marine segment  underlying primary rates and reinsurance rates are expected to increase  particularly for risks exposed to atlantic hurricanes 
during the january renewal season  we achieved average rate increases of over on our us property renewal business and nearly on our non us property renewal business  as well as average rate increases of approximately on our marine renewal business 
despite having increased our assumptions for the frequency and severity of us windstorm catastrophe exposures  we believe these rate increases result in a portfolio of catastrophe exposed business with expected profitability that is higher than the expected profitability of last year s portfolio 
during the january renewal season we wrote more property catastrophe excess of loss business and less property risk excess of loss and pro rata business 
property risk excess of loss and pro rata business typically generates relatively more premium than property catastrophe excess of loss business having a similar risk level 
however  we believe property catastrophe excess of loss business generally provides more quantifiable catastrophe exposure and is currently priced more attractively 
for  we have targeted our net probable maximum loss from catastrophe exposures at various occurrence levels to be approximately equal in dollar terms to the comparable levels in  but relatively lower as a percentage of our expected total capital for the respective years 
for example  we expect our net probable maximum loss from catastrophe exposures at the one in year occurrence level to be approximately of total capital for versus approximately of total capital for we believe this lower level of net catastrophe exposure will reduce the expected volatility of our operating results 
given the magnitude of recent hurricane losses for the insurance and reinsurance industry in general and expectations for an active atlantic hurricane season in  we believe there is a heightened perception of risk among ceding companies  reinsurers and rating agencies 
accordingly  demand for property catastrophe risk transfer may increase beyond current levels 
we expect that  as revisions to catastrophe models are released and new rating agency capital requirements are better understood  there will be continued us market hardening for property and marine business 
for the casualty segment  we believe that losses from the hurricanes and enhanced rating agency capital requirements will cause certain insurance and reinsurance companies to review their strategies for business which is not generally exposed to catastrophes 
during the january renewal season  ceding companies were willing to increase retentions and reinsurers competed for participation on the best treaties 
however  rates stabilized in certain lines of business where they had been declining 
as a result  we believe that the business underwritten during the january renewal season has approximately the same level of expected profitability as the business we wrote during the comparable period in we have written more commercial liability and less professional liability  trade credit  accident and health and clash business 
we have written approximately the same amount of surety  political risk  medical malpractice and regional business as we did during the comparable period in we believe that financial security remains a significant concern for buyers of long tailed reinsurance protection  who typically seek reinsurers with strong balance sheets  quality ratings  and a proven claims paying record 
we believe that our rating  capitalization and reputation as a lead casualty reinsurer positions us well to write profitable business as the opportunities arise 
we expect these conditions to persist through and that the casualty market will remain attractive 
in the finite risk segment  we believe that the ongoing investigations by the sec  the office of the attorney general for the state of new york  the us attorney for the southern district of new york and non us regulatory authorities such as the bermuda monetary authority and the uk financial services 
table of contents authority resulted in significantly diminished demand for limited risk transfer products in we believe we can deploy our human and financial capital more profitably in other lines of business 
as a result  we are devoting fewer underwriting and pricing resources to this segment than in prior years and wrote a relatively small amount of finite business during the january renewal season relative to the comparable period last year 
although we expect the relatively low level of demand will continue during  there are signs that buyers are  once again  considering finite reinsurance as a solution to their risk management needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market and credit risk the company s principal invested assets are fixed maturity securities  which are subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices and credit risk resulting from adverse changes in the borrower s ability to meet its debt service obligations 
the company s strategy to limit this risk is to place its investments in high quality credit issues and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer or asset class 
the company also selects investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity to reflect  in the aggregate  the underlying characteristics of our unpaid losses and lae 
the company attempts to minimize the credit risk by actively monitoring the portfolio and requiring a minimum average credit rating for its portfolio of a as defined by moody s investor service 
as of december   the portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  has a dollar weighted average rating of aa the company has other receivable amounts subject to credit risk 
the most significant of these are reinsurance premiums receivable from ceding companies 
we also have reinsurance recoverable amounts from our retrocessionaires 
to mitigate credit risk related to premium receivables  we have established standards for ceding companies and  in most cases  have a contractual right of offset thereby allowing the company to settle claims net of any premium receivable 
to mitigate credit risk related to our reinsurance recoverable amounts  we consider the financial strength of our retrocessionaires when determining whether to purchase coverage from them 
retrocessional coverage is generally obtained from companies rated a or better by a 
m 
best unless the retrocessionaire s obligations are fully collateralized 
for exposures where losses become known and are paid in a relatively short period of time  we may obtain retrocessional coverage from companies that may not be rated but that provide adequate collateral 
the financial performance and rating status of all material retrocessionaires is routinely monitored 
in accordance with industry practice  the company frequently pays amounts in respect of claims under contracts to reinsurance brokers  for payment over to the ceding companies 
in the event that a broker fails to make such a payment  depending on the jurisdiction  the company may remain liable to the ceding company for the payment 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when ceding companies remit premiums to reinsurance brokers  such premiums are deemed to have been paid to the company and the ceding company is longer liable to the company for those amounts whether or not the funds are actually received by the company 
consequently  the company assumes a degree of credit risk associated with its brokers during the premium and loss settlement process 
to mitigate credit risk related to reinsurance brokers  the company has established guidelines for brokers and intermediaries 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
movements in rates can result in changes in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio and can cause changes in the actual timing of receipt of certain principal payments 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to extension risk 
conversely  a decline in interest rates will result in a rise in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio and can expose our portfolio  in particular our mortgage backed securities  to prepayment risk 
the aggregate hypothetical 
table of contents impact on our fixed maturity portfolio  generated from an immediate parallel shift in the treasury yield curve  as of december  is approximately as follows in thousands interest rate shift in basis points bp bp current bp bp total market value percent change in market value resulting unrealized appreciation depreciation foreign currency risk the company writes business on a worldwide basis 
consequently  the company s principal exposure to foreign currency risk is its transaction of business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates can impact revenues  costs  receivables and liabilities  as measured in the us dollar  our financial reporting currency 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure to its largest foreign currency risks by holding invested assets denominated in foreign currencies to offset liabilities denominated in the same foreign currencies
