item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated the following management discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement discussed below and in the restatement note 
executive overview we are the largest equipment rental company in the world with an integrated network of rental locations in the united states  canada and mexico 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because larger companies often have significant competitive advantages over smaller competitors 
these advantages include greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services as well as with newer and better maintained equipment  and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among branches 
we offer for rent over  classes of rental equipment  including construction equipment  industrial and heavy machinery  aerial work platforms  traffic control equipment  trench safety equipment and homeowner items 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of rental used equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other 
rental equipment revenues have historically accounted for more than percent of our total revenues and we expect this trend to continue 
in august  we received notice from the sec that it was conducting a non public  fact finding inquiry of the company 
the sec inquiry appears to relate to a broad range of the company s accounting practices and is not confined to a specific period 
in march  our board of directors formed a special committee of 
table of contents independent directors to review matters related to the sec inquiry 
our board of directors received and acted upon findings of the special committee in january the actions that we took with respect to the special committee s findings relating to the minor sale leaseback transactions and the trade packages  as well as some other accounting matters  are discussed below 
with respect to the accounting for purchase business combinations  the primary focus of the special committee s inquiry was our historical practices concerning the valuation of rental equipment acquired in purchase business combinations and the practice of recognizing profit on sales of this equipment within one year of its acquisition 
these practices are further discussed below 
the sec inquiry is ongoing and we are continuing to cooperate fully with the sec 
restatement and reclassification of previously issued consolidated financial statements  certain findings of the special committee and related matters subsequent to the filing of our form k for the year ended december   which included our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  it was determined that the company s originally issued financial statements for those periods required restatement to correct the accounting for i the recognition of equipment rental revenue  ii irregularities identified by the special committee with respect to six short term  or minor  equipment sale leaseback transactions  iii self insurance reserves  iv customer relationships  and v the provision for income taxes 
in addition  we identified other matters for which we are not restating but for which we have determined additional disclosure would be useful 
restatement of financial statements the effects of the restatement adjustments on our originally reported results of operations for the years ended december  and and on our originally reported retained earnings at december   are summarized below 
net loss year ended december  retained earnings at december  as originally reported adjustments for equipment rental revenues a sale leaseback transactions b self insurance reserves c customer relationships d pre tax impact related tax effects adjustments  net of tax income taxes e total adjustments  net of tax as restated below is a summary of the nature and amount of the adjustments reflected in the restatement all amounts are presented on a pre tax basis unless otherwise noted 
as discussed above in item  in light of the systems and records presently available to us  it is not possible for us to reconstruct detailed financial data for and prior periods with any amount of effort or expense 
accordingly  we do not have the ability to restate  and we have not restated  our previously reported consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and however  we have provided below the impact on originally reported pre tax and or net income for and of certain of the items for which we are restating  as information for these discrete items is available to us and we believe this information is useful 

table of contents a recognition of equipment rental revenues 
our originally reported results reflected the recognition of equipment rental revenues based on the minimum amounts which became due and payable under the terms of our applicable rental contracts 
we have determined that equipment rental revenues should be recognized on a straight line basis and have restated our previously reported results to reflect this correction of an error 
our restatement had the impact of increasing decreasing originally reported pre tax income for  and for periods prior to by   and  respectively 
b sale leaseback transactions 
in   and we previously recognized gross profits of  and  respectively  in conjunction with six minor sale leaseback transactions 
it has been determined that the accounting for these transactions involved irregularities  and we are restating our financial statements to properly reflect the accounting for these six transactions 
at the dates of the original minor sale leaseback transactions  we recognized a premium excess profit above fair value on these transactions 
in exchange for receiving this profit premium  we agreed to disburse cash in later periods as well as pay premiums for subsequent equipment purchases subsequent purchases 
our restatement for the sale leaseback transactions had the impact of increasing decreasing originally reported pre tax income for   and by    and  respectively 
these restatement adjustments reflect the elimination of the premium originally received in the minor sale leaseback transactions as well as the deferral of any profit until all of our obligations associated with the originally received premiums were settled 
additionally  the adjustments reflect a reduction in previously recorded depreciation expense because this expense reflected capitalized equipment costs for subsequent purchases that were overstated 
c self insurance reserves 
we self insure for certain types of claims associated with our business  including i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage caused by our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our prior methodology for developing self insurance reserves was based on management estimates of ultimate liability which were developed without obtaining actuarial valuations 
in  management adopted an estimation approach based on third party actuarial calculations that properly reflects and incorporates actuarial assumptions 
based on actuarial calculations performed by our third party actuaries in late and  we concluded that the estimation process we previously used did not adequately take into account certain factors and that  as a result  a restatement was required 
the factors that were not adequately addressed by our historical estimation process included future changes in the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
our restatement for the self insurance reserves had the impact of increasing decreasing originally reported pre tax income for    and for periods prior to by    and  respectively 
d customer relationships 
in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 which required the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and prohibited the use of the pooling of interests method 
sfas no 
also changed the definition of intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination  providing specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
sfas applied to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the acquisition date is july  or later 
we have reviewed acquisitions we made since july  and have determined that a portion of the purchase price for these acquisitions previously allocated to goodwill should be recorded as a separate intangible asset customer relationships 
this restatement reflects the amortization expense associated with the reallocation of a portion of the purchase price from goodwill which is not amortized to customer relationships which are amortized 
this correction of an error had the impact of decreasing originally reported pre tax income for and by and  respectively 
e income taxes 
we have restated our income tax provision to i correctly reflect all book to tax temporary differences primarily depreciation and nondeductible reserves and accruals  ii reflect appropriate 
table of contents tax benefits for net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credits  iii calculate deferred taxes at appropriate legal entity tax rates  and iv account for the settlement of an irs audit examination 
our restatement for income taxes had the impact of increasing decreasing originally reported net income for    and for periods prior to by    and  respectively 
buy out of operating lease 
in addition to the restatement matters discussed above  we have determined that of costs for the year ended december  previously classified below operating income should be reclassified to cost of equipment revenues and included in operating income 
this amount primarily represents the amount in excess of the fair value related to the buy out of equipment under operating leases 
this reclassification  which has the effect of reducing gross profit and other expense income  net by  has no impact on originally reported net income or earnings per share for the year ended december  trade packages 
during the period from the fourth quarter of through  the company sold used equipment to certain suppliers referred to as trade packages 
in certain of the trade packages  prices may have included a premium above fair value 
in order to induce these suppliers to buy used equipment at premium prices  the company made commitments or concessions to the suppliers 
it has been determined that the accounting for those transactions involved irregularities and that the company improperly recognized revenue from the transactions involving the undisclosed inducements 
however  because records were not created that would have permitted the linkage of the sales and inducements as a result of instructions given by certain former employees of the company  the company is unable to determine the portion of the revenue and gross profit recognized in connection with trade packages with these suppliers between and that was improperly recognized 
during this period  all sales of used equipment to these suppliers which includes all trade package transactions generated total revenues and gross profits of and  respectively 
notwithstanding the lack of records relating to these transactions  the company believes that its financial statements from and after are materially correct with respect to the effect of these transactions 
the special committee concluded that  based on the evidence it reviewed  the practices regarding certain trade packages and minor sale leaseback transactions described above appear to have been directed by the company s two former chief financial officers 
both of these individuals  who are no longer with the company  declined to cooperate with the special committee s investigation 
based upon recommendations of the special committee  the company s board of directors directed the company  among other things  to evaluate potential claims relating to certain former company personnel  including these individuals and compensation and benefits previously received by them described elsewhere in this report 
purchase accounting 
the company was formed and began operations in with the acquisition of six equipment rental companies 
during the subsequent three year period  we grew rapidly and completed approximately additional acquisitions 
by the end of  we were the largest equipment rental company in the world  with annual revenues of approximately billion 
with management s focus now turned toward organic growth  the pace of our acquisitions significantly slowed and from september through the date of this report we completed only eight acquisitions 
substantially all of the business combinations that we have completed since the inception of the company were accounted for as purchases  however  there were several significant business combinations accounted for in the earlier period that were accounted for as poolings 
accounting standards applicable to purchase business combinations require the acquiring company to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition 
any excess between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities assumed should be recognized as goodwill 
in our historical accounting for these purchase business combinations  long lived fixed assets comprised primarily of rental equipment and goodwill generally represented the largest components of our acquisitions 
as a result  when we performed our purchase price allocation process  the purchase price was primarily allocated to these assets 

table of contents as discussed above  in march  our board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to review matters related to the sec inquiry 
the special committee made certain findings related to the company s historical practices concerning the valuation of rental equipment acquired in purchase business combinations 
the committee concluded that certain of these practices were not adequate between and august these practices included  among other things  the use of inconsistent valuation methodologies  some of which were reflected in memoranda that were not provided to or reviewed by the company s auditors  suggestions contained in those memoranda that improper methods of valuation be used although the committee did not find evidence that such improper methods were generally applied  inadequate supervision of personnel  inadequate coordination with providers of outside valuations and apparent confusion on the part of one of those providers 
the special committee concluded that certain company personnel whom the committee was unable to identify may have sought to manipulate opening balance sheet values for equipment acquired in purchase business combinations by causing them to be understated and that these opening balance sheet values may have been understated by an amount the committee was unable to determine 
following our review of our historical practices and the findings of the special committee  the company considered whether the effect of the deficiencies identified by the committee required a restatement of previously reported results 
these deficiencies in our historical practices between and august may have resulted in inaccurate values being ascribed to rental equipment that we acquired in purchase business combinations  including in some cases values that may have been below fair value 
however  we do not have the ability to revalue this equipment because we are unable to currently determine its historical physical condition and the records that currently exist for this equipment are not sufficient to establish the physical condition of the equipment at the time of its acquisition 
the equipment valuations performed at the time of the acquisition  some of which included a physical inspection  reflected an assessment of the condition of the equipment 
while  as the special committee identified  there were various deficiencies in our historical valuation practices  it is not possible to accurately revalue this equipment to assess the reasonableness of specific valuations 
therefore  we believe the only feasible approach is to give effect to the valuations that were performed contemporaneously with these acquisitions 
accordingly  we have determined that restatement is not appropriate 
however  we have also determined that it would be useful to illustrate what our historical results would have been had these equipment values been higher 
the analysis below reflects the hypothetical impact on total gross profit including gross profit on equipment rentals as well as sales of rental equipment and net income loss for the years through had the rental equipment we acquired in purchase acquisitions during the period between and august been valued at an amount percent and percent higher than it was previously valued 
the hypothetical impact on gross profit does not reflect costs and expenses that are considered operating expenses and are appropriately classified below gross profit 
hypothetical impact of understatement of equipment values as reported percent hypothetical percent hypothetical total gross profit net loss total gross profit net loss total gross profit net loss 
table of contents this analysis reflects the hypothetical revaluation of equipment acquired in connection with purchase business combinations of the type associated with our general rentals and trench safety  pump and power segments  which constituted approximately percent of all acquisitions we completed during the subject period 
we have not reflected in this chart the favorable impact of reduced goodwill impairment charges associated with a hypothetical reallocation of the purchase price between goodwill and rental asset values 
in light of the systems and records presently available to us  it is not possible to perform this analysis for years prior to because of our current inability to push down certain reconciling items on our general ledger and sub ledger to individual rental asset records  we cannot calculate the amounts ultimately attributed to rental assets in our historical purchase price allocation process 
accordingly  we do not have a reasonable basis for applying this sensitivity analysis to periods prior to however  we have performed an analysis of this prior period in the table below 
this analysis reflects the revaluation of equipment to reflect our hypothetical total gross profit had the rental equipment we acquired during the relevant period been valued higher 
to the extent the revaluation of the equipment converted a gain to a hypothetical loss  we limited the revaluation increase in basis of the equipment to an amount that would reduce the gain to zero 
similarly  to the extent that equipment was originally sold at a loss  the revaluation does not increase the basis of the related equipment 
the as reported results reflect the results included in this report  including restated results for and any potential impact on gross profit and net income loss had this rental equipment acquired between and august been valued percent or percent higher than it was previously valued would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations for through accordingly  notwithstanding deficiencies in the company s historical valuation process as it relates to purchase business combinations  the company does not believe a restatement is required and believes that its financial statements from and after are materially correct with respect to the effect of equipment valuations 
in addition to the deficiencies identified by the special committee related to our historical practices described above  instances were identified where equipment acquired in purchase business combinations between and august was sold within a short time following the acquisition at gross margins that indicate the value initially ascribed to the equipment may have been too low 
for the reasons described above  however  we are unable to assess the reasonableness of allocations of basis to specific acquired assets 
notwithstanding the impracticability associated with making this assessment  however  we believe it is useful to illustrate what our gross profit would have been for the period between and had our gross margin on sales of all rental equipment including equipment acquired in connection with purchase acquisitions been different 
the analysis below reflects the hypothetical impact on previously reported gross margins and gross profits on sales of all rental equipment for the years through had these gross margins been percent and percent 

table of contents hypothetical impact of reduced gross margins previously reported reduced gm reduced gm gross margin gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin gross profit n a gross margin gross profit n a we have not reflected in this chart the favorable impact of reduced goodwill impairment charges associated with a hypothetical reallocation of the purchase price between goodwill and rental asset values 
any potentially overstated gross profit associated with these sales  the latest of which would have occurred in august  would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations for through accordingly  notwithstanding deficiencies in the company s historical valuation process as it relates to purchase business combinations  the company does not believe a restatement is required and believes that its financial statements from and after are materially correct with respect to the effect of equipment valuations 
financial overview free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental equipment  purchases of other property and equipment and buy outs of equipment leases plus iii proceeds from sales of rental equipment and proceeds from sales leaseback transactions 
management believes free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
accordingly  free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow 
full year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of rental equipment purchases of property and equipment buy outs of equipment leases proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales leaseback free cash flow 
table of contents in  we reported revenues and free cash flow of billion and  respectively 
our revenue growth of percent outpaced our primary end market  private non residential construction  which grew percent in according to department of commerce data 
this growth reflects increased rental rates of percent and a percentage point increase in dollar equipment utilization to percent 
dollar equipment utilization is calculated with consideration to our equipment rental revenue and the average original cost of equipment in our rental fleet 
in  we substantially reduced our net loss from this was accomplished through a percent growth in rental rates  a percent increase in contractor supplies sales  a percent reduction in interest expense and the expansion of our rental fleet 
the reduced net loss also reflects a reduction in goodwill impairment charges  partially offset by increased refinancing costs of approximately our rental fleet had an original equipment cost of billion at december  as compared to billion at december  additionally  we reported free cash flow of in  after investing in capital expenditures 
in  we also refinanced approximately billion of debt 
this refinancing extended our debt maturities  reduced interest expense and provided the company with greater financial flexibility 
as a result of our significantly improved operations and refinancing activity  we ended with a cash balance of in  despite a weak non residential construction market  we substantially reduced our net loss and increased our revenues percent to billion 
the reduced net loss reflected increased rental rates of percent 
additionally  the reduced net loss reflected the absence of a charge associated with a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as well as a restructuring charge  partially offset by a charge for the buy out of equipment leases and a charge for refinancing costs

contractor supplies sales include our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other includes our repair services including parts sales as well as the operations of our subsidiaries that develop and market software for use by equipment rental companies in managing and operating multiple branch locations 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase resulted primarily from a percent increase in equipment rentals  an percent increase in sales of rental equipment and a percent increase in contractor supply sales

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions  estimates and judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by days  the monthly term 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also 
table of contents recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
for construction related contracts in our traffic control segment which comprise approximately percent of our total revenues  revenues are recognized based on the percentage of work completed 
use of the percentage of completion method requires management to make estimates of the expected total revenues  total costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect 
we base our estimate on a combination of an analysis of our accounts receivable on a specific accounts basis and historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
useful lives of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from percent to percent of cost 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period the asset will generate revenues  and the salvage value is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a significant number of acquisitions in the past and expect that we will continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived fixed assets generally represent the largest component of our acquisitions 
the long lived fixed assets that we acquire are primarily rental equipment  transportation equipment and real estate 
with limited exceptions  virtually all of the rental equipment that we have acquired through purchase business combinations has been classified as to be used  rather than as to be sold 
equipment that we acquire and classify as to be used is recorded at fair value  as determined by replacement cost to the company of such equipment 
we use third party valuation experts to help calculate replacement cost 
in addition to long lived fixed assets  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values reflected on the acquired entities balance sheets 
however  when appropriate  we adjust these book values for factors such as collectibility and existence 
the intangible assets that we have acquired are primarily goodwill  customer related intangibles specifically customer relationships and covenants not to compete 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
customer relationships have been valued based on an excess earnings or income approach with consideration to projected cash flows 
when specifically negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase agreements  we have valued non compete agreements based on the amounts assigned to them in the purchase agreements as these amounts represent the amounts negotiated in an arm s length transaction 
when not negotiated by the parties in the applicable purchase agreements  we estimated the fair value of non compete agreements based on a percentage of the acquisition s goodwill 
impairment of goodwill 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill 
commencing january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently as events occur that indicate a decline in fair value below its carrying value 
in general  this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill  calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards  is at least equal to the recorded value on our balance sheet 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value  we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an operating expense 

table of contents prior to january   we tested for goodwill impairment on a branch by branch basis 
accordingly  a goodwill write off was required even if only one or a limited number of our branches had an impairment as of the testing date and even if there was no impairment for all our branches on an aggregate basis 
commencing january   we began testing for goodwill impairment at a regional  rather than a branch  level 
we began testing for impairment at this level because accounting standards require that goodwill impairment testing be performed at the reporting unit level 
in  following a reorganization of our reporting structure  our regions became our reporting units 
this change in reporting units may impact future goodwill impairment analyses because there are substantially fewer regions nine than there are branches in excess of 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the valuation of our long lived assets on an ongoing basis and assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  then the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value 
the determination of recoverability is based upon an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the asset s remaining useful life 
we must make estimates and assumptions when applying the undiscounted cash flow analysis 
these estimates and assumptions may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our business prospects or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize write downs on our long lived assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards and we record deferred tax assets based on current enacted tax rates and laws 
the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined by considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we generally evaluate projected taxable income for a five year period to determine the recoverability of all deferred tax assets and  in addition  examine the length of the carryforward to ensure that the deferred tax assets are established at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have not provided a valuation allowance related to our federal deferred tax assets because we believe such assets will be recovered during the carryforward period 
if sufficient evidence becomes apparent that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized  we would be required to record a valuation allowance for such assets  which would result in additional income tax expense 
we have provided a valuation allowance related to certain state operating loss carryforwards 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  we may incur additional tax expense based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
in addition  when applicable  we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax positions require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we provide self insurance 
claims for which we self insure include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage caused by our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates which incorporate actuarial valuations that are periodically prepared by our third party actuaries 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 

table of contents legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in item legal proceedings and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations prior to  we had one reportable segment general rentals 
in the first quarter of  we began reporting information for two reporting segments general rentals and traffic control 
in  we began reporting for an additional segment  trench safety  pump and power 
the segment presentation in this report reflects the change in segments which occurred in the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial  industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada and has one location in mexico 
the traffic control segment includes the rental of equipment used in the management of traffic related services and activities 
the traffic control segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects and municipalities 
the traffic control segment operates in the united states 
the trench safety  pump and power segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  pump and power segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates in the united states and has one location in canada 
these segments align the company s external segment reporting to how management evaluates and allocates resources 
the company evaluates segment performance based on segment operating results 
we completed acquisitions in each of  and which are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in view of the fact that our operating results for these years were affected by acquisitions  we believe that our results for these periods are not directly comparable  although there is no material impact from these acquisitions 

table of contents revenues by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows general rentals trench safety  pump and power traffic control total equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other total revenue equipment rentals

for each of the three years in the period ended december   general rentals accounted for at least percent of the total operating profit 
this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals revenue contribution over the same period  which has ranged from approximately to percent 

table of contents operating margin in increased percentage points from the improvement in operating margin reflects a percent increase in rental rates 
operating margin in decreased percentage points from the reduction in operating margin reflects the incurrence of of costs associated with the buy out of equipment leases as well as rental costs outpacing revenue growth  particularly in repairs and maintenance and delivery 
trench safety  pump and power 
operating profit in increased reflecting the gross margin associated with the increase in revenues 
operating profits in were essentially unchanged from traffic control 
operating loss in increased primarily reflecting the gross margin associated with the  or percent  reduction in traffic control equipment rental revenues 
operating profit in decreased primarily reflecting the gross margin associated with the  or percent  reduction in traffic control equipment rental revenues 
gross margin 
we have historically realized higher gross margins on sales of rental equipment than on sales of new equipment 
this is consistent with the marketplace in general and not peculiar to united rentals 
gross margins by revenue classification were as follows year ended december  total gross margin equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other gross margin of percent increased percentage points from the improved margin performance was primarily a result of a percentage point increase in equipment rentals gross margin  partially offset by an percentage point reduction in gross margins on sales of rental equipment 
the improved equipment rental margin reflected a percent increase in rental rates as well as a percentage point improvement in dollar equipment utilization 
the reduction in gross margins on sales of rental equipment  as well as the increased margin realized on sales of new equipment  reflect a change in the mix of equipment sold 
gross margin of percent decreased percent from this reduction primarily reflects a percentage point reduction in equipment rentals gross margin 
the reduction in equipment rentals gross margin reflects the incurrence of of costs associated with the buy out of equipment leases 
excluding this charge  equipment rental gross margins would have approximated percent  reflecting reduced equipment rentals in traffic control as well as cost increases associated with higher costs for insurance and claims  fleet repair and maintenance and fuel and delivery

pursuant to an accounting standard adopted in  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we are required to periodically review our goodwill for impairment 
in general  this means that we must determine whether the fair value of the goodwill  calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards  is at least equal to the recorded value shown on our balance sheet 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the recorded value  we are required to write off the excess goodwill as an expense 
we are required to review our goodwill for impairment annually as of a scheduled review date  however  if events or circumstances suggest that our goodwill could be impaired  we may be required to conduct an earlier review 
our scheduled review date is october of each year  however  we reviewed our traffic control segment goodwill as of september  because continued weakness in this segment suggested that the goodwill associated with this segment could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of additionally  in the third quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of to write off the remaining goodwill associated with our traffic control segment 
the charge in the fourth quarter of reflected weakness in the financial performance of certain of our branches 
the charge in the third quarter of reflected the unfavorable financial performance of our traffic control operations

our other intangible assets consist of non compete agreements as well as customer related intangible assets 
the amount of non rental depreciation and amortization has approximated percent of revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  interest expense for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  interest expense 
table of contents interest expense for the year ended december  decreased  or percent  as compared to this decrease was attributable to lower interest rates on our debt primarily due to i the debt refinancings that we completed in the fourth quarter of and in and ii the positive impact of interest rate swaps that increased the portion of our interest expense that was based on floating interest rates 
as of december   approximately percent of our total debt was floating rate debt 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased or percent 
this increase primarily reflected higher interest costs related to the senior notes we issued in december and april  partially offset by lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
as described below  in the first quarter of  we refinanced these senior notes with lower interest rate notes 
interest expense subordinate convertible debentures and preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust for each of the three years in the period ended december  was as follows year ended december  interest expense subordinate convertible debentures preferred dividends of a subsidiary trust in august  a subsidiary trust of holdings sold certain trust preferred securities and used the proceeds from such sale to purchase certain convertible subordinated debentures from holdings 
the subsidiary trust that issued the trust preferred securities was consolidated with holdings until december   when it was deconsolidated following the adoption of a new accounting principle 
for periods prior to the deconsolidation  the dividends on the trust preferred securities were reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations and the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures was eliminated in consolidation and thus was not reflected as an expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
for periods after the deconsolidation  the dividends on the trust preferred securities are no longer reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations and the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures is no longer eliminated in consolidation and thus is now reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
because the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures corresponds to the dividends on the trust preferred securities  this change does not alter the total amount of expense reported

certain information concerning restricted stock 
as of december   we have granted to employees other than executive officers and directors approximately  shares of restricted stock that have not yet vested 
the shares vest in  or or earlier upon a change in control of the company  death  disability  retirement or certain terminations of employment  and are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting on certain other terminations of employment  the violation of non compete provisions and certain other events 
if a holder of restricted stock sells his stock and receives sales proceeds that are less than a specified guaranteed amount set forth in the grant instrument  we have agreed to pay the holder the shortfall between the amount received and such specified amount  however  the foregoing only applies to sales that are made within five trading days of the vesting date 
the specified guaranteed amount is i per share with respect to approximately  shares  per share with respect to approximately  shares  and per share with respect to approximately  shares scheduled to vest in and ii per share with respect to approximately  shares scheduled to vest in and iii per share with respect to approximately  shares scheduled to vest in certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements 
we lease real estate  rental equipment and non rental equipment under operating leases as a regular business activity 
as part of some of our equipment operating leases  we guarantee that the value of the equipment at the end of the term will not be less than a specified projected residual value 
if the actual residual value for all equipment subject to such guarantees were to be zero  then our maximum potential liability under these guarantees would be approximately under current circumstances we do not anticipate paying significant amounts under these guarantees  however  we 
table of contents cannot be certain that changes in market conditions or other factors will not cause the actual residual values to be lower than those currently anticipated 
in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  this potential liability was not reflected on our balance sheet as of december  or any prior date because the leases associated with such guarantees were entered into prior to january  for additional information concerning lease payment obligations under our operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations above 
certain information concerning trust preferred securities 
in august  a subsidiary trust of holdings sold of quips 
the trust used the proceeds from the sale of these securities to purchase percent subordinated convertible debentures due which resulted in holdings receiving all of the net proceeds of the sale 
the subsidiary trust that issued the trust preferred securities was consolidated with holdings until december   when it was deconsolidated 
for periods prior to the deconsolidation  the dividends on the trust preferred securities were reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations and the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures was eliminated in consolidation and thus was not reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for periods after the deconsolidation  the dividends on the trust preferred securities are no longer reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations and the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures is no longer eliminated in consolidation and thus is now reflected as an expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
because the interest on the subordinated convertible debentures corresponds to the dividends on the trust preferred securities  this change does not alter the total amount of expense required to be recorded 
relationship between holdings and uri 
holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary uri and subsidiaries of uri 
holdings provides certain services to uri in connection with its operations 
these services principally include i senior management services  ii finance and tax related services and support  iii information technology systems and support  iv acquisition related services  v legal services  and vi human resource support 
in addition  holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by uri and its subsidiaries 
uri has made  and expects to continue to make  certain payments to holdings in respect of the services provided by holdings to uri 
the expenses relating to uri s payments to holdings are reflected on uri s financial statements as selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  although not legally obligated to do so  uri has in the past made  and expects that it will in the future make  distributions to holdings to  among other things  enable holdings to pay interest on the convertible debentures that were issued to a subsidiary trust of holdings as described above 
as discussed above  our consolidated financial statements reflect i for periods prior to january   expenses related to dividends on certain trust preferred securities issued by a subsidiary trust of holdings and ii for periods after january   expenses related to certain subordinated convertible debentures issued by holdings to such subsidiary trust  however  the foregoing expenses are not reflected on the consolidated financial statements of uri because uri is not obligated with respect to the foregoing securities 
this is the principal reason for the difference in the historical net income loss reported on the consolidated financial statements of uri and the net income loss reported on the consolidated financial statements of holdings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk primarily consists of interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily associated with our canadian operations 
interest rate risk 
we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion and cap agreements with an agreement notional 
table of contents amount of the effect of the swap agreement was to convert billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments 
the fixed rate notes being converted consisted of i of our percent notes through  ii of our percent notes  and iii of our percent senior subordinated notes through as of december   after giving effect to our interest rate swap and cap agreements  we had an aggregate of approximately billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
for this purpose  the portion of the term loan subject to the cap is considered fixed 
the debt that is subject to fluctuations in interest rates includes of borrowings under our revolver canadian facility  billion in swaps  and of term loans not subject to an interest rate cap

as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements  our annual earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of our variable rate indebtedness may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility from time to time 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements
