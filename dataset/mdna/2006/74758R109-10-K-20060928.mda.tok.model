part i item business introduction we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
tape libraries consist of cartridge tape drives  tape cartridges and robotics to move the cartridges from their storage locations to the tape drives under software control 
our tape libraries provide data storage solutions for organizations requiring backup  recovery and archival storage of critical data 
our products are compatible with commonly used operating systems  including unix  windows  and linux 
our tape libraries are also compatible with a wide range of storage management software packages  such as those supplied by computer associates  emc legato  tivoli  symantec veritas  commvault and bakbone software 
we offer tape libraries for multiple tape drive technologies  including lto  ait  super ait  and superdlt 
we sell our tape libraries worldwide  primarily to value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
these customers typically integrate our tape libraries with software from third party vendors and related hardware such as servers and network components to provide storage solutions  which are then sold to end users 
we configure our libraries based on each customer s individual requirements  with a normal delivery time of one to three working days 
this rapid fulfillment of customer orders allows our resellers to minimize their inventory levels and allows us to compete effectively with distribution channels used by our competitors 
qualstar was incorporated in california in our initial products were ibm compatible track reel to reel tape drives 
in  we entered the tape automation market with a series of tape libraries incorporating mm tape drives 
since that time  we have introduced a succession of tape library models designed to work with the leading automation capable tape drive technologies 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of revenues for fiscal  approximately of revenues for fiscal  and approximately of revenues for fiscal sales of power supplies  services and other products accounted for the balance of our revenues 
in july  we purchased the assets of npower  incorporated  a supplier of ultra small high efficiency open frame switching power supplies 
power supplies provided by npower are utilized within some of our tape library products as well as sold to original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers for incorporation into their products 
npower products are sold under the npower brand name as well as under a private label brand name through independent sales representatives and 
table of contents distributors 
revenues from npower products totaled approximately of revenues for fiscal  of revenues for fiscal and of revenues for fiscal industry background storing  managing and protecting data has become critical to the operation of many enterprises and governments as the world economy becomes increasingly information dependent 
the data storage industry is growing in response to the increase in the amount of data that is generated and that must be preserved 
the amount of data has been increasing due to the growth in the number of computers  the number  size and complexity of computer networks and software applications  and the emergence of new applications such as image processing  internet services  medical image storage  video and motion picture image storage  and other multi media applications 
in addition  businesses continue to generate increasing amounts of traditional business information with respect to their products  customers and financial data 
this increase in the amount of data that is generated stimulates increases in the demand for data storage and the management of this data 
factors driving growth in data storage increased demand from internet businesses 
the growth in the internet has created businesses that depend on the creation  access to and archival storage of data 
we believe this demand will continue to grow as individuals and businesses increase their reliance on the internet for communications  commerce and data retrieval 
growth in new types of data 
new types of data are also fueling the growth in data storage 
for example  graphics  audio  video  medical and security images  and multi media uses such as video on demand  require far greater storage capacity than text and financial data 
recognition of the critical importance of data 
corporate databases contain useful information about customer records  order patterns and other factors that can be analyzed and transformed into a valuable asset and a competitive advantage 
the ability to efficiently store  manage and protect this information is important to the value and success of many businesses 
the usefulness of past and present data is further enhanced by sophisticated data mining software applications that can access and analyze large databases 
growing awareness of the need for disaster protection 
companies are recognizing that without their data they may not survive 
natural disasters  as well as overt and covert actions targeted at individual companies  classes of users or whole countries  can destroy data and entire data centers  threatening a company s very existence 
systematic replication and secure off site storage of corporate data is recognized as the best defense against catastrophic data loss 
tape libraries are a key technology in most corporate data disaster protection plans 
compliance with new regulatory requirements for records retention 
many businesses now have to deal with new regulatory requirements from various governmental agencies that require businesses to retain data for longer periods of time 
the regulations that have received the most visibility include hipaa requirements covering medical records  sarbanes oxley  which addresses corporate governance  and rule a under the securities exchange act of  regarding recordkeeping requirements for the securities industry 
these regulations and others are projected to increase demand for long term storage capacity over the next few years 
growth in network computing applications and data 
the use of computer networks has shifted critical information and applications to network servers to allow more people to gain access to stored data as well as to create new data 
as the speed of network computing has increased  numerous new applications have become feasible such as computer fax and e mail  all of which generate progressively more data 
organizations are increasingly aware of the need to protect this data  as networks become a mission critical element of many operations 

table of contents decrease in the costs of storing data 
the costs of data storage have decreased with advances in technology and improved manufacturing processes 
we expect these costs to continue to decrease 
the decrease in the cost of data storage encourages the storage of more data and makes it more cost effective to simply add more storage capacity than to remove old data  which in the past may have been purged periodically 
advances in storage management technologies the growth in data is contributing to an evolution in traditional storage solutions 
new technologies are designed to provide high speed connectivity for data intensive applications across multiple operating systems  including unix  windows  and linux 
these new methods of storage and data management technologies include the following fibre channel 
fibre channel is an interface technology based on industry standards for the connection of storage devices to networks 
interface is the term used to describe the electronics  cabling and software used to facilitate communications between devices 
with fibre channel  users are better able to share stored information with other storage devices and servers over longer distances  with faster data transfer speeds  thereby increasing the importance of storage area networks 
storage area networks 
storage area network  or san  architecture applies the inherent benefits of a networked approach to data storage applications  which allows data to move efficiently and reliably between multiple storage devices and servers 
the benefits of san architecture also include increasing the expandability of existing storage solutions and providing a higher level of connectivity than exists with traditional technologies 
additionally  sans are able to provide these benefits across multiple operating systems 
advanced storage management software 
this software automatically migrates infrequently accessed data to the lower cost storage medium such as a tape library 
a user s request for this data at some later date will recall the data automatically from the tape library 
this process reduces the overall storage cost by using the least expensive storage medium to store data that is not expected to be needed on a frequent basis 
advances in storage management software have increased the ability of businesses to more cost effectively store  manage and retrieve data  which in turn allows businesses to operate more efficiently 
network attached storage 
current storage devices are dependent on a file server for all commands and control 
network attached storage devices give storage devices file server functionality  which allow users to plug a storage device directly into a network without requiring a separate file server 
this allows users to maintain  or even enhance  system performance while saving on both time and cost 
types of data storage current non volatile storage solutions are based primarily on two technologies magnetic disk and magnetic tape 
these technologies represent a compromise among a variety of competing factors including capacity  cost  speed  portability and data reliability 
magnetic tapes are removable  which allows them to be transported easily to an off site location for security or protection from physical harm 
magnetic disks provide quicker access to stored data and generally are used when speed is important 
less frequently used data is often migrated from magnetic disks to tape storage 
tape libraries provide an online solution  where less frequently used data files are stored on tape at substantially lower cost compared to disk while still providing automated access 

table of contents tape libraries and applications tape libraries automate the tape loading process  eliminate errors induced by human operators  and enhance security compared to tapes that must be retrieved and loaded manually 
tape libraries can also be operated from remote locations around the clock  thus  eliminating the need for an operator 
automated tape libraries are a key component in a company s overall storage solution and data protection strategy 
tape drives and tape media are the two key components of tape libraries 
the costs of tape drives and tape media have declined with advances in technology  and we expect this trend to continue 
as prices decline  new applications for automated storage become justified  further increasing the number of applications that can benefit from the use of tape libraries 
we believe that continued technological improvements in tape drives and tape media will continue to reduce overall storage costs in the future 
current and emerging applications for tape libraries include automated backup 
backup is the creation of a duplicate copy of current data for the purpose of recovering the data in the event the original is lost or damaged 
an automated tape library  in conjunction with storage management software  can backup network data at any time without human intervention 
a library with multiple tape drives can backup data using all of its drives simultaneously  thus significantly speeding up the recording process 
backup tapes can be removed from the library and stored in an off site location for protection against a loss of the primary site 
archiving 
archiving is the storage of data for historical purposes 
when information is stored on tape  automated tape libraries  under application control  can catalog tapes for future retrieval and prevent unauthorized removal or corruption of data by using password or key lock protection 
archival tapes provide a historic record for use in fraud detection  audit  legal and other processes 
tape libraries are also used for archiving due to benefits offered by the tape medium  such as long term data integrity  resistance to environmental contamination  ease of relocation  low cost  and the availability of write once read many or worm tapes 
image management 
storage intensive applications such as satellite mapping and medical image management systems are turning to tape libraries because of the cost advantage over traditional storage methods 
x ray images or mri results  for instance  must frequently be kept on file for years 
storing a digitized image in a tape library costs considerably less than storing a film copy  and can be retrieved years later with the click of a mouse 
distribution of tape library products the requirements for storage solutions vary depending on the size of an enterprise  the type of data generated and the amount of data to be stored 
with the increased dependence on stored data  most organizations  regardless of their size  have a heightened need for storage solutions that integrate devices such as tape drives  tape libraries and storage management software 
those organizations with sufficient in house information technology resources can rely on their internal infrastructure and expertise to design  purchase and implement their own storage solutions 
these organizations may elect to purchase equipment from distributors or directly from the original equipment manufacturers 
many organizations  however  do not have sufficient in house resources but have the same need for data storage solutions 
these organizations often look to value added resellers to design  supply and install their storage solutions 
value added resellers develop and install storage solutions for enterprises that face complex storage needs but lack the in house capability of designing and implementing the proper solution or have chosen to outsource these functions 
typically  the value added reseller will select among a variety of different hardware technologies and software options  as well as provide installation and other services  to deliver a complete storage solution for the end user 
value added resellers require rapid turnaround of orders  custom configuration of tape libraries  drop shipment to their customer s site  software  and marketing and technical support 

table of contents original equipment manufacturers generally resell products made by others under their own brand name and typically assume responsibility for product sales  service and support 
original equipment manufacturers enable manufacturers  such as qualstar  to reach end users not served by other channels and to serve select vertical markets where specific original equipment manufacturers have exceptional strength 
original equipment manufacturers require special services such as product configuration control  extensive qualification testing  custom colors and private labeling 
our solutions we offer storage solutions that respond to the growing data management challenges facing businesses today  while addressing the unique needs of value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
we believe that high reliability is important to the end users of our products due to the critical nature of the data that is being stored  shorter time periods available for the back up operations  and the operation of backup systems during hours when personnel may not be available to respond to problems 
to address these concerns  we emphasize quality and reliability in the design  manufacturing and testing of our products which reduces the potential for product failures and results in products that require little maintenance 
the technology utilized in automated tape libraries is continuously evolving due to advances in data recording methods  component cost reductions  advances in semiconductor and microprocessor technologies  and a general trend toward miniaturization in the electronics industry 
this changing technology requires that we continuously develop and market new products to prevent our product lines from becoming obsolete 
our tape libraries are compatible with over forty five third party storage management software packages  including those supplied by computer associates  emc legato  tivoli  symantec veritas  commvault and bakbone software 
storage management software enables network administrators to allocate the use of storage technologies among user groups or tasks  to manage data from a central location  and to retrieve  transfer and backup data between multiple workstations 
we believe that storage management software is a crucial component of any automated storage installation  and lack of compatibility is a significant barrier to entry for new tape library competitors 
to ensure compatibility  our engineers work with independent software vendors during the product development cycles 
we do not have contracts with any independent software vendors  nor do we need access to their software code to design our products 
we maintain relationships with them by supplying tape libraries so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries and by evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries 
we also support our relationships with them by keeping them informed about current and anticipated changes to our products and by referring business to them when value added resellers or end users inquire about storage management software sources 
strategy our goals are to enhance our position as a supplier of automated tape libraries and to maintain or increase our market share in each of the tape formats in which we compete 
to achieve these goals  we intend to offer libraries for multiple tape drive technologies 
we offer tape libraries for a range of tape drive technologies  including lto  ait  super ait  and superdlt 
by offering products based on multiple tape drive technologies  we reduce our dependence on the success of any single tape technology and can offer products that target the specific preferences of resellers and original equipment manufacturers and their end user customers 
focus on value added reseller channels 
we sell our products primarily through selected value added resellers who have a strong market presence  have demonstrated the ability to work directly 
table of contents with end users  and who maintain relationships with major vendors of storage management software 
because we market our products primarily through this channel  we have implemented a variety of programs to support and enhance our relationships with our reseller partners 
these programs are designed to benefit the reseller and increase the likelihood of selling our products 
we intend to maintain our marketing presence in support of this channel 
we conduct business with our value added resellers on an individual purchase order basis and no long term purchase commitments are involved 
maintain and strengthen original equipment manufacturer relationships 
we sell our products to several companies under private label or original equipment manufacturer relationships 
original equipment manufacturer sales enable us to reach some end users not served by our value added resellers 
the same product characteristics that make our tape libraries attractive to value added resellers also are important to original equipment manufacturers 
we conduct business with our original equipment manufacturer customers on an individual purchase order basis and no long term purchase commitments are involved 
develop libraries for new tape technologies 
the tape drive industry is continuously advancing the state of technology 
we will continue to design new libraries for those technologies that appear promising and that meet our standards for capacity  quality and reliability 
we believe that our experience  efficiency and strict control over the development and manufacture of new products are key factors in the successful execution of our strategy 
we design our tape libraries with a high percentage of common parts  use quality components and minimize the number of moving parts 
we utilize proprietary techniques in the design  production and testing of our libraries in order to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce our costs 
we manufacture all of our products at a single facility and we control our inventory closely to provide rapid delivery to our customers 
these steps allow us to design and bring to market new products rapidly in response to changing technology 
products tape libraries we offer a number of tape library families  each capable of incorporating one or more tape drive technologies  as summarized in the following table tape drive range of tape maximum capacity product family technology cartridges in terabytes tls sony ait to tls sony sait to tls quantum sdlt to tls lto to rls sony ait to rls sony sait to rls quantum sdlt rls lto to xls series lto a terabyte is one million megabytes  or one thousand gigabytes 
the table shows native capacity and excludes gains from data compression  which can increase capacity by more than 
 tapes and  terabytes reflect the product configuration at its initial release stage 
planned future releases of internal firmware will allow expansion to as high as  tapes and  terabytes using lto tape technology 
our tape library families include a number of models that differ in storage capacity  price and features 
our libraries are installed in network computing environments ranging from small departmental networks 
table of contents to enterprise wide networks supporting hundreds of users 
we believe that selling products for multiple tape drive technologies insulates us somewhat from the dynamics of the marketplace as various tape standards compete for market share 
this helps our products appeal to the broadest possible range of end user market segments 
this wide range of products makes us a one stop supplier for our value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer customers  enabling them to meet most end user requirements for a specific tape format 
tape libraries generally contain two or more tape drives and from ten to thousands of tapes 
we design our tape libraries for continuous  unattended operation 
multiple tape drives allow simultaneous access to different data files by different users on the network  and increase the rate at which data can move on to  out of  or within the network 
a library with multiple tape drives can back up data using all drives simultaneously  significantly speeding up the recording process 
in some of our libraries  tape cartridges are stored in removable magazines  allowing for easy bulk removal of the tapes 
our libraries also offer features such as barcode readers to scan cartridge labels and an input output port for importing and exporting tapes under system control 
several of our library models are expandable in the field by increasing the number of tape storage positions 
this feature provides the end user with the ability to increase data capacity as storage needs grow 
we continue to develop and release new libraries to expand our product offerings to meet the changing demands of the marketplace 
in addition  we continue to enhance and improve our existing products to maintain our competitive position 
some of our tape libraries incorporate a number of specialized features that we believe improve reliability  serviceability and performance  including rapid tape drive replacement 
we design our libraries so that a tape drive can be replaced quickly without special tools 
this feature minimizes the off line time required when a tape drive must be replaced  and frequently avoids the high cost and delays of a service call 
fibre channel connectivity 
we offer a fibre channel option on many of our models for connection to storage area networks and other high performance applications 
closed loop servo control 
our tape libraries use digital closed loop servo control for robotic motion to provide precise tape handling 
this yields motion that is smooth  repeatable and highly reliable 
brushless motors 
motors are a key component in any robotic system 
we use only brushless electric motors in our tape libraries 
brushless motors provide longer life and less electrical noise compared to conventional brush type motors 
we build many of our own motors in order to obtain optimum performance and reliability 
remote management 
many larger companies with global back up requirements or disaster management programs require tape libraries that can be located off site in various regions  but that must be administered from a single location 
with our remote library manager  customers can put libraries anywhere in the world and manage them from a single administrative hub using a standard web browser 
our rls series of tape libraries are designed to fit efficiently in equipment racks and provide back up capacity in only five standard units  or a total of inches of rack space 
in addition  some models in the rls series were designed to support dual redundant power supplies and hot swappable tape drives 
power supplies in addition to tape libraries  we design  manufacture  and sell ultra small  open frame  high efficiency switching power supplies 
these power supplies are used to convert ac line voltage to dc for use in a wide variety of electronic equipment such as telecommunications equipment  machine tools  routers  switches  wireless systems and gaming devices 

table of contents our power supplies are sold under the n power brand 
we have specialized in units that are less than inches high and that are optimized for high efficiency operation 
the high efficiency allows the units to be operated in confined spaces without heating up the surrounding equipment 
we believe that as worldwide energy concerns and energy costs rise  our high efficiency approach will become more important 
additionally  these products are utilized within some of our tape library products 
other products we also sell ancillary products related to our tape libraries  such as tape media  tape magazines  cables  bar code labels and fibre channel adapters 
sales and marketing sales we sell our tape library products primarily through value added resellers 
our sales force will initiate contact with value added resellers who are candidates to sell our tape libraries 
we strive to develop relationships with resellers who have expertise in storage management applications  established relationships with end users and the experience to understand and satisfy their customers needs 
we believe that by selling directly to value added resellers  we have an advantage over competitors who will often sell directly to end users  thereby competing with their resellers 
some of the advantages of our strategy include the following higher profit margins 
focusing on this channel  we achieve economies that result in higher profit margins to be shared by both the reseller and us 
custom configurations 
we offer custom configurations of our products  such as special paint  private branding and non standard options  on very short notice 
channel conflicts avoided 
we refer substantially all end user inquiries to our reseller partners 
frequently  our sales force will make end user visits with resellers to help close a pending sale 
credit 
we extend credit terms to resellers who meet our credit requirements 
rapid delivery 
we generally ship a product within one to three working days of confirming an order  rivaling the delivery time of competitors that use distributors to bring products to market 
although we sell our tape libraries primarily to value added resellers  we believe that original equipment manufacturers are an important element of our business 
the sales cycle for original equipment manufacturers generally encompasses six months to one year and may involve extensive product and system qualification testing  evaluation  integration and verification 
original equipment manufacturers typically assume responsibility for product sales  service and support 
our international sales are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
european sales are coordinated through our european sales office in the united kingdom 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
revenues from customers outside of north america were approximately million  or of revenues in fiscal  approximately million  or of revenues in fiscal  and approximately million or of revenues in fiscal our sales are spread across a broad customer base 
revenues from qualstar s two largest customers combined were approximately   and for the years ended june    and  respectively and no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue 

table of contents marketing we support our sales efforts with a broad array of marketing programs designed to generate brand awareness  attract and retain qualified value added resellers and inform end users about the advantages of our products 
we provide our resellers with a full range of marketing materials  including product specifications  sales literature  software connectivity information and product application notes 
we train our resellers to sell our products and to answer customers questions 
we advertise in key publications and participate in trade shows 
we display our products under the qualstar brand name at some trade shows and participate in other trade shows in partnership with our principal suppliers and resellers 
we support our marketing and customer support with a website that features comprehensive marketing and product information 
we conduct sales and technical training classes for our resellers 
we also conduct various promotional activities for resellers and end users  including product specific rebates and cooperative advertising 
customer service and technical support we believe that strong customer service and technical support is an essential aspect of our business 
our customer service and technical support efforts consist of the following components technical support 
our technical support personnel are available twenty four hours per day  monday through friday 
technical support personnel are available to all customers at no charge by telephone  facsimile and e mail to answer questions and solve problems relating to our products 
estimated costs of this service are provided for when revenue is recognized 
our technical support personnel are trained in all aspects of our products 
our support staff is located at our headquarters in simi valley  california 
we sell service contracts for on site service of our tape libraries installed within the united states and canada  which are fulfilled by ibm corporation and on site service contracts sold in europe are fulfilled by eastman kodak sa commercial imaging group 
sales engineering 
our engineers provide pre sales support to our resellers  and post sales support if necessary 
engineers typically become involved in more complex problem solving situations involving interactions between our products  third party software  network server hardware and the network operating systems 
engineers work with resellers and end users over the telephone and at an end user site as required 
training 
we offer a product maintenance training program for end users  value added resellers  original equipment manufacturers  customer service and technical support personnel 
we conduct training classes at our headquarters 
warranty 
the warranty period on our tape libraries is three years 
some tls and all rls models have three year advance replacement warranty coverage that provides for replacement of components or  if necessary  complete libraries 
all other tls models have a one year advance replacement warranty with the second and third year being return to factory for service at no charge 
customers may purchase extended advance replacement service coverage and on site service if they are located in the united states  canada and some countries within europe 
manufacturing and suppliers we manufacture all of our tape libraries at our facility in simi valley  california 
we operate our manufacturing on one daily eight hour shift 
however  if required  we have the ability to add a second or third shift to increase our capacity 
to respond rapidly to orders  we build our tape libraries to a semi finished state  perform full testing and then place the tape libraries in a holding area until an order is received 
once an order is confirmed  we remove the unit from the holding area  install tape drives and configure the unit to meet the specific requirements of the order  retest and then ship 

table of contents the manufacturing cycle to bring our libraries to a semi finished state is approximately five working days for our tls and rls libraries and approximately working days for our xls libraries 
we believe that this process represents an effective way to control our inventory levels while maintaining the ability to fill specific orders in short lead times 
we coordinate inventory planning and management with suppliers and customers to match our production to market demand 
once we confirm an order  we generally ship the product within one to three working days 
we believe this response time is among the fastest in the industry and gives us a competitive edge 
because we fill the majority of our orders as they are received  our backlog generally is small and is not indicative of future revenues 
we carefully select our suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts that meet our specifications and volume requirements 
inventory planning and management is coordinated closely with suppliers to match our production needs 
many of the components assembled into our libraries are off the shelf parts  which reduces the risk of part shortages and allows us to maintain inventory of these parts at a minimum 
a number of our component parts are not available off the shelf  but are designed to our specifications for integration into our products 
tape drives and tape media are available only from a limited number of suppliers  some of which are sole source providers 
some of our suppliers compete with us by selling their own tape libraries 
the risk of allocation is greater upon the introduction of a new tape drive technology 
any disruption in supplies of tape drives or tape media could delay shipments of our products 
competition the market for automated tape libraries is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
because we offer a broad range of libraries for different tape drive technologies  we tend to have a large number of competitors that differ depending on the particular format and performance level 
our principal competitors in this market segment include sun storagetek  quantum corporation  overland storage  inc  and spectra logic corporation 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  better name recognition  larger research and development staffs  and more capabilities in manufacturing  marketing and distributing products than we do 
our competitors may develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our products 
we are not iso certified  unlike some of our competitors  which may limit some customers ability to purchase our products 
as competitors introduce products in a particular tape drive technology  the increased competition normally results in price erosion and a reduction in gross margins for all competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against either current or potential competitors or that competition will not cause a reduction in our revenues or profit margins 
we believe that our ability to compete depends on a number of factors  including the success and timing of new product developments by us and by our competitors  compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems  product performance  reliability  price  marketing and sales execution and customer support 
specifically  we believe that the principal competitive factors in the selection of a tape library include reliability of the robotic assembly that handles the tape cartridges  initial purchase price  storage capacity  speed of data transfer  compatibility with existing operating systems and storage management software  after sale expandability of a tape library to meet increasing storage requirements  expected product life  cost of maintenance and total cost of ownership  and physical configuration and power requirements of the library 

table of contents we believe our tape libraries compete favorably overall with respect to many of these factors 
research and development our research and development team consists of engineers and technicians who have data storage and related industry experience 
we have developed over separate tape library models for eleven different tape formats over the last eleven years 
our research and development efforts rely on the integration of multiple engineering disciplines to generate products that meet market needs in a competitive and timely fashion 
successful development of automated tape libraries requires the integration of mechanical design  electronic design packaging  and firmware design into a single product 
product success also relies on the engineering group s thorough knowledge of each of the different tape drive technologies 
we frequently develop new products in response to the availability of a new tape drive technology 
as tape drive manufacturers compete in the marketplace  they continually invest in research and development to gain performance leadership either by offering increasingly enhanced versions of their current tape drive products or by introducing an entirely new tape drive technology 
we benefit from these industry developments by utilizing the new technology in our products 
our engineers work closely with the tape drive manufacturers through the drive development cycle to assure that reliable tape library and tape drive combinations are brought to market 
the design architecture of our tape libraries makes use of common parts across most product families  allowing us to develop and introduce new products quickly 
if a new tape drive is an advanced version of one already incorporated in one or more of our products  our time and dollar investment to incorporate the new drive can be relatively small  with the primary focus being on verification testing 
when the form factors differ  the time and investment requirements can grow substantially  and may require development of a new product family altogether 
we also develop new products as we identify emerging market needs 
our sales  marketing  product development and engineering groups identify products to fulfill customer and marketplace needs 
our research and development group concentrates on leveraging previous engineering investments into new products 
for example  our firmware is based on successive generations of the operating system developed for our first library 
we also use common parts in our different library series and leverage our electro mechanical and electronic hardware technology from previous products into next generation designs 
in some cases  entire subassemblies are transferable  leveraging not only engineering time but also materials purchasing  inventory stocking and manufacturing efforts 
our research and development expenses were approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal we anticipate research and development costs to remain about the same in fiscal intellectual property we rely on copyright protection of our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property provides significant protection from competition 
we believe that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the tape storage industry  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our personnel and timely new product introductions 
we enter into employee proprietary information and inventions agreements with our engineers along with all employees and consultants to protect our technology and designs 
however  we do not believe that such protection can preclude competitors from developing substantially equivalent products

item a 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  as described at page of this report under the caption forward looking statements 
we believe that the risks described below are the most important factors which may cause our actual future results of operations to differ materially from the results projected in the forward looking statements 
risks related to our business the principal risks applicable to our business in general are described below 
specific risks applicable to our tape library and power supply operating segments are described in the following subsections of item a 
we have a limited number of executives 
the loss of any single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
the success of our business is tied closely to the managerial  engineering and business acumen of our existing executives 
william j 
gervais  our president  has been largely responsible for the development of most of our tape libraries  has overseen our operations and growth  and established and maintained our strategic relationships 
we expect that he will continue these efforts for the foreseeable future 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract  retain and motivate key executives and other key personnel  many of whom have been instrumental in developing new technologies and strategic plans 
we may not be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
however  our current dependence on a limited number of executives and other key personnel  for whom replacements may be difficult to find  entails a risk that we may not be able to supervise and manage our ongoing operations 
our lack of significant order backlog makes it difficult to forecast future revenues and operating results 
we normally ship products within a few days after orders are received 
consequently  we do not have significant order backlog and a large portion of our revenues in each quarter result from orders placed during that quarter 
because backlog can be an important indicator of future revenues  our lack of backlog makes it more difficult to forecast our future revenues 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  unexpected fluctuations in revenues could negatively impact our quarterly operating results 
our research and development spending may not yield results that justify the costs incurred 
in recent fiscal years we have spent substantial amounts for research and development 
our products and markets are technologically advanced and rapidly evolving  and we cannot be assured that these efforts will successfully provide us with new or upgraded products that will be competitive 
if these 
table of contents programs are not successful  our investment in research and development will not yield corresponding benefits to us 
our customers have the right to return our products in certain circumstances 
an excessive number of returns may reduce our revenues 
our customers have days from the date of purchase to return products that do not conform to an end user s requirements 
distributors have additional return privileges that extend well beyond days 
we may otherwise allow product returns if we think that doing so maximizes the effectiveness of our sales channels and promotes our reputation for quality and service 
although we estimate and reserve for potential returns in our reported financial results  actual returns could exceed our estimates 
if the number of returns exceeds our estimates  our financial results could be adversely impacted for the periods during which returns are made 
we may spend money pursuing sales that do not occur when anticipated or at all 
original equipment manufacturer customers typically conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they begin to market and sell new products 
this evaluation process is lengthy and may range from six months to one year or more 
this process is complex and may require significant sales  marketing  engineering and management resources on our part 
the process becomes more complex as we simultaneously qualify our products with multiple customers or pursue large orders with a single customer 
as a result  we may expend resources to develop customer relationships before we recognize any revenue from these relationships  if at all 
we sell a significant portion of our products to customers located outside the united states 
currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our revenue or profitability 
revenues from shipments to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal  approximately of revenues in fiscal and approximately of revenues in fiscal we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues 
our international sales subject us to a number of risks  including political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or our ability to market our products in foreign countries  although we denominate our international sales in us dollars  currency fluctuations could make our products unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  greater difficulty of administering business overseas may increase the costs of foreign sales and support  foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our products  longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the profitability of foreign sales  and our current determination not to seek iso certification  a widely accepted method of establishing and certifying the quality of a manufacturer s operations  may reduce sales 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our revenues or profitability 

table of contents a failure to develop and maintain proprietary technology may negatively affect our business 
we rely on copyright protection of electronic circuits and our firmware  as well as patent protection for some of our designs and products 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we do not believe our intellectual property rights provide significant protection from competition 
as a consequence  these rights may not preclude competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
in addition  many aspects of our products are not subject to intellectual property protection and therefore can be reproduced by our competitors 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in recent years  there has been an increasing amount of litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
qualstar is not currently directly involved in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings 
however  in april we settled litigation that raytheon company had filed alleging that qualstar and eight other named defendants infringed on a patent owned by raytheon company entitled mass data storage library 
in the future  we may become subject to other claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using our products or services that use the challenged intellectual property  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products or services that use the infringed technology  which redesign may be either economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
our warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations 
we have established reserves for the estimated liability associated with our product warranties 
however  we could experience unforeseen circumstances where these or future reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to several factors  including general economic conditions affecting spending for information technology  increased competition and pricing pressures  reductions in the size  delays in the timing  or cancellation of significant customer orders  shifts in product or distribution channel mix  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of products by us  our original equipment manufacturer customers or our competitors  expansions or reductions in our relationships with value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer customers  
table of contents financial difficulties affecting our value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers that render them unable to pay amounts owed to us  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products  new product developments by storage device manufacturers  such as disk drives  that could render our products less cost effective or less competitive  the rate of growth in the data storage market and the various segments within it  timing and levels of our operating expenses  and availability of key components and performance of key suppliers 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock and this  in the aggregate  may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
our officers and directors could implement corporate actions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole 
our executive officers and directors own beneficially  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of june  as a result  these shareholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interests of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as shareholders  may lead them to vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as shareholders per se and thus from the interests of other shareholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and require shareholders to give advance notice if they wish to nominate directors or submit proposals for shareholder approval 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may adversely affect the market price  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends and therefore you will only be able to recover your investment in our common stock  if at all  by selling the shares of the stock that you own 
we historically have pursued a policy of reinvesting our earnings in research and development  expanding our value added reseller and original equipment manufacturer relationships  and expanding our 
table of contents manufacturing capabilities 
consequently  we have never paid dividends on our shares of capital stock 
we currently intend to continue this policy for the foreseeable future to strengthen our financial and competitive position in the markets in which we operate 
trading in our stock has been limited and our stock price has been volatile 
consequently  it may be difficult to sell your shares 
there has been very little trading in shares of our stock and some days it does not trade at all 
this  as well as the factors listed below  has caused the price of our stock to be volatile 
consequently  it may be difficult to sell your shares of our stock at the price you paid for them or at a price equal to that quoted on the nasdaq stock market 
factors that may cause our stock price to fluctuate in the future include quarterly variations in operating results  especially if they differ from our previously announced forecasts or forecasts made by analysts  our announcements of anticipated future revenues or operating results  announcements concerning us  our competitors  our customers  or our industry  the introduction of new technology or products by us or our competitors  comments regarding us and the data storage market made by industry analysts or on internet bulletin boards  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies  changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  and changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
risks related to our tape library business the principal risks applicable specifically to our tape library operating segment are described below 
our principal competitors devote greater financial resources to developing  marketing and selling automated tape libraries 
consequently  we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share 
we face significant competition in developing and selling automated tape libraries 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
we have significantly fewer financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than many of our competitors and these limited resources may harm our business in many ways 
for example  in the past several years our competitors have acquired other tape library companies  increased the geographic scope of their market  offered a wider range of tape library products  and developed and acquired proprietary software and disk based products that operate in conjunction with their products and the products of their competitors 

table of contents in the future  our competitors may leverage their greater resources to develop  manufacture and market products that are less expensive or technologically superior to our products  attend more trade shows and spend more on advertising and marketing  reach a wider array of potential customers through a broader range of distribution channels  respond more quickly to new or changing technologies  customer requirements and standards  or reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share 
we believe competitive pressures are likely to continue 
we cannot guarantee that our resources will be sufficient to address this competition or that we will manage costs and adopt strategies capable of effectively utilizing our resources 
if we are unable to respond to competitive pressures successfully  our prices and profit margins may fall and our market share may decrease 
our suppliers could reduce shipments of tape drives and tape media 
if this occurs  we would be forced to curtail production  our revenues could fall and our market share could decline 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal  approximately of our revenues for fiscal and approximately of our revenues for fiscal we depend on a limited number of third party manufacturers to supply us with the tape drives and tape media that we incorporate into our automated tape libraries 
some tape drive manufacturers  including sony corporation and quantum corporation  compete with us by also manufacturing tape libraries 
there can be no assurance that other tape drive manufacturers will not also begin to manufacture libraries 
historically  some of these suppliers have been unable to meet demand for their products and have allocated their limited supply among customers 
if suppliers limit our supply of tape drives or tape media  we may be forced to delay or cancel shipments of our tape libraries 
the major supplier risks we face include the following sony electronics  inc is our sole source supplier of ait and super ait drives and media 
in the past  sony has allocated some of their products and may allocate them again in the future 
in fiscal we derived approximately million or of our revenues  in fiscal we derived approximately million  or  of our revenues  and in fiscal we derived approximately million  or of revenues from the sale of libraries  tape drives and tape media based on sony ait and super ait technologies 
if sony reduces its sales to us or raises its prices  we could lose revenues and our margins could decline 
quantum corporation is our sole source supplier of superdlt tape drives and competes with us as a manufacturer of automated tape libraries 
in the past  quantum has allocated quantities of tape drives among its customers 
it is possible that quantum will allocate again  and as a result  may be unable to meet our future superdlt tape drive requirements 
the lto standard was developed by an industry consortium consisting of ibm  hewlett packard and quantum certance 
lto competes with ait and other half inch tape drives and media 
all three drive suppliers also sell automated tape libraries that utilize lto tape drives and compete with our products 
therefore  even if we receive adequate allocation  it may be at a price that renders our products uncompetitive 
our other suppliers have in the past been  and may in the future be  unable to meet our demand  including our needs for timely delivery  adequate quantity and high quality 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our significant suppliers 
the partial or complete loss of any of our suppliers could result in lost revenue  added costs and production delays or could otherwise harm our business and customer relationships 

table of contents our revenues could decline if we fail to execute our distribution strategy successfully 
we distribute and sell our automated tape libraries primarily through value added resellers and original equipment manufacturers  and intend to continue this strategy for the foreseeable future 
value added resellers integrate our tape libraries with products of other manufacturers and sell the combined products to their own customers 
original equipment manufacturers combine our tape libraries with their own products and sell the combined product under their own brand 
we currently devote  and intend to continue to devote  significant resources to develop these relationships 
a failure to initiate  manage and expand our relationships with value added resellers or original equipment manufacturers could limit our ability to grow or sustain our current level of revenues 
our focus on the distribution of our products through value added resellers poses the following risks we may reach fewer customers because we depend on value added resellers to market to end users and these value added resellers may fail to market effectively or fail to devote sufficient or effective sales  marketing and technical support to the sales of our products  we may lose sales because many of our value added resellers sell products that compete with our products 
these value added resellers may reduce their marketing efforts for our products in favor of products manufactured by our competitors  our costs may increase as value added resellers generally require a higher level of customer support than do original equipment manufacturers  and as the market for tape libraries matures  we expect that tape libraries designed for small and medium size businesses will not require the level of sales  marketing and technical support traditionally provided by value added resellers and  consequently  tape libraries for these customers will be increasingly sold through distribution channels rather than through value added resellers 
we depend upon our original equipment manufacturer customers ability to develop new products  applications and product enhancements that incorporate our products in a timely  cost effective and customer friendly manner 
we cannot guarantee that our original equipment manufacturer customers will meet these challenges effectively 
original equipment manufacturers typically conduct substantial and lengthy evaluation programs before certifying a new product for inclusion in their product line 
we may be required to devote significant financial and human resources to these evaluation programs with no assurance that our products will ever be selected 
in addition  even if selected by the original equipment manufacturer  there generally is no requirement that the original equipment manufacturer purchase any particular amount of product from us or that it refrain from purchasing competing products 
we do not have any exclusive agreements with our value added resellers or original equipment manufacturers  who purchase our products on an individual purchase order basis 
if we lose important value added resellers or original equipment manufacturer customers  if they reduce their focus on our products or if we are unable to obtain additional value added reseller or original equipment manufacturer customers  our business could suffer 
we rely on tape technology for a substantial part of our revenues 
our business will be harmed if demand for storage solutions using tape technology declines or fails to develop as we expect 
we derive a high percentage of our revenues from products that incorporate some form of tape technology 
we expect to derive a high percentage of our revenues from these products for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will continue to be subject to the risk of a decrease in revenues if demand for these products declines or if rising prices make it more difficult to obtain them 
if products incorporating other technologies gain comparable or superior market acceptance and competitive price advantage  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely and materially affected unless we successfully develop and market products incorporating the new technology 

table of contents if we fail to develop and introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our products do not contain the features required by the marketplace  we will eventually lose market share and sales to more innovative competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
the future success of qualstar will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology  to develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis  and to introduce  manufacture and achieve market acceptance of these new and enhanced products 
in particular  our success will depend on the market acceptance of our new xls family of automated tape libraries 
our rls and tls families of tape libraries are facing increasing competition from products manufactured by our competitors and may face competition from other types of storage devices that may be developed in the future 
development schedules for high technology products are inherently subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance we will be able to meet our product development schedules or that our development costs will be within budgeted amounts 
if the products or product enhancements developed are not deliverable due to technical problems  quality issues or component shortages  or if such products or product enhancements are not accepted by the marketplace or are unreliable  then our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the introduction of new storage technologies or the adoption of an industry standard different than our current product standards could render our existing products obsolete 
we depend upon independent software vendors to provide management software that makes our tape libraries functional 
the utility of an automated tape library depends upon the storage management software  which supports the library and integrates it into the user s computing environment to provide a complete storage solution 
we do not develop and have no control over the development of this storage management software 
instead we rely on third party independent software vendors to develop and support this software 
accordingly  the continued development and future growth of the market for our products will depend partly upon the success of software vendors to meet the overall data storage and management needs of tape library purchasers and our ability to maintain relationships with these firms 
although we do not have contracts with any third party independent software vendors  we maintain relationships with them by supplying tape libraries so they can qualify their software to work with our tape libraries  evaluating their software for compatibility with our tape libraries  keeping them informed as to current and contemplated changes to our products  and referring business to them when value added resellers or end users inquire about software sources 
we may have to expend significant amounts of time and money defending or settling product liability claims arising from failures of our tape libraries 
because our tape library customers use our products to store and backup their important data  we face potential liability if our products fail to perform 
although we maintain general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage could reduce our profitability or cause us to discontinue operations 
undetected flaws could increase our costs  reduce our revenues and divert resources from our core business needs 
our tape libraries are complex 
despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes  we may not be able to control and eliminate 
table of contents manufacturing flaws adequately 
these flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with a newly introduced product  a new version of an existing product  or a product that has been integrated into a network storage solution with the products of other vendors 
the variety of contexts in which errors may arise may make it difficult to identify the source of a problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  or damage our reputation 
to address these risks  we frequently revise and update manufacturing and test procedures to address engineering and component changes to our products 
if we fail to adequately monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays  repair or replacement costs or damage to our reputation 
product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts 
significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business 
risks related to our power supply business the principal risks applicable specifically to our power supply operating segment are described below 
we depend on a single contract manufacturer for the majority of our power supplies 
loss of this supplier could harm our business 
the primary supplier of our n power power supplies is located in china 
if this manufacturer should be unable to deliver products to us on a timely basis or at all  our power supply business could be adversely affected 
though we have four years of favorable experience with this supplier  there can be no assurance that circumstances might not change and compel this supplier to curtail or terminate deliveries to us 
environmental health and safety laws may restrict our operations 
we are subject to local laws and regulations in various regions in which we sell our power supplies  including the european union eu in particular 
a new eu directive may have a material impact on our business 
the restriction of certain hazardous substances directive rohs  which restricts the distribution of certain substances  including lead  within the eu  became effective july  we are in the process of transitioning our power supply manufacturing to a rohs compliant process 
during the transition  there is risk that some of our inventory manufactured before the transition may become unmarketable in the eu  resulting in inventory write downs that could adversely affect our operating results 
price erosion may have a material adverse effect on our margins and profitability 
the majority of the power supply manufactures that we compete with have substantially more resources and more models available than we do 
additionally the power supply business is generally characterized by intense competition 
there can be no assurances that a competitor will not choose to use such resources to underprice our products in the market  thereby adversely affecting our sales or margins

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell automated magnetic tape libraries used to store  retrieve and manage electronic data primarily in network computing environments 
we offer tape libraries for multiple tape drive technologies  including lto  ait  super ait  and superdlt tape drives and media 
many enterprises now routinely manage very large databases  in addition to storing information on local desktop computers 
this  coupled with the growth in the amount of data from new sources and applications  is increasing the need for managing and storing data efficiently 
anticipating the increased demand for tape libraries  we have developed tape libraries spanning a broad range of tape formats  prices  capacity and performance 
we expect our products to continue to evolve in the future in response to emerging tape technologies and changing customer preferences 
we have developed a network of value added resellers who specialize in delivering complete storage solutions to end users 
end users of our products range from small businesses requiring simple automated backup solutions to large organizations needing complex storage management solutions 
we also sell our products to original equipment manufacturers who bundle our products with their own and sell them as part of a complete system or solution 
we assist our customers with marketing  sales and technical support 
our international sales efforts are currently directed from our corporate offices in simi valley  california 
european sales are coordinated through our european sales office in the united kingdom 
all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
revenues from sales outside north america were approximately million  or of revenues in fiscal  approximately million  or of revenues in fiscal  and approximately million  or of revenues in fiscal we also design  develop  manufacture and sell ultra small high efficiency open frame switching power supplies for original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  servers  routers  switches  raids  and other equipment 
our power supplies are sold under the npower brand name through independent sales representatives and a private distributor 
the primary customers are original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
net revenues include revenues from the sale of tape libraries  library tape drives  tape cartridges  ancillary products  and power supplies 
ancillary revenues include service  repair  and on site service agreements net of the cost of any third party service contracts 
automated tape libraries and related products  such as tape drives and tape media  represented approximately of revenues in fiscal  approximately of revenues in fiscal  and approximately of revenues in fiscal sales of ancillary products and services  and power supplies accounted for the balance of our revenues 
gross margins depend on several factors  including the cost of manufacturing  product mix  customer demand and the level of competition 
larger tape libraries provide higher gross margins than do smaller tape libraries primarily because the competition is less intense in this market segment 
research and development activities include the design and development of new products  as well as enhancements to existing products 
our engineering group is developing our next generation of automated tape libraries  currently in transition from the development phase to the production phase  with manufacturing now set up in our simi valley facility 
we expect research and development expenses to stay approximately the same in absolute dollars in fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal due to additional expenses associated with bringing our next generation tape libraries to market 

table of contents we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal  representing the difference between the exercise price of stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and directors during fiscal and the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
amortization of deferred compensation  which was recorded as general and administrative expense in the statement of operations  was in fiscal and fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the deferred compensation related to these stock options and restricted stock was fully amortized as of june  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer promotional offers  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty costs  investments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to our customers  less estimated returns  for which provision is made at the time of sale 
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock in simi valley  california  or another shipping location designated by us 
in general  these customers are allowed to return the product  free of penalty  within thirty days of shipment  if the product does not meet the end user s requirements 
we record an allowance for estimated sales returns based on past experience and current knowledge of our customer base 
our experience has been such that only a very small percentage of libraries are returned 
should our experience change  however  we may require additional allowances for sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of accounts receivable 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer credit worthiness and changes in customers payment terms and patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made this determination 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence  potential shrinkage  or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about 
table of contents future demand and market conditions 
if technology changes more rapidly than expected  or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty obligations we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including active monitoring and evaluation of product failure rates  material usage and estimation of service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
historically our warranty costs have not been significant 
share based compensation share based compensation is accounted for in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
the inputs we use for the model require the use of judgement  estimates and assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the stock  the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise  and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and actual results could differ from these estimates  and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of net deferred tax assets in future years 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for such a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  the valuation allowance would be decreased accordingly 
we may periodically undergo examinations by the federal and state regulatory authorities and the internal revenue service 
we may be assessed additional taxes and or penalties contingent on the outcome of these examinations 
our previous examinations have not resulted in any unfavorable or significant assessments 
the company had fiscal under audit by the internal revenue service irs for which the irs issued a no change letter in the quarter ended march

the following table summarizes our revenue by major product line years ended june  tape library revenues tls rls other revenues service media power supplies upgrades  spares  track fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or is attributed to declining unit sales of our older tape library products in the tls and rls product lines  incorporating ait  sait  dlt  and lto tape technology  in conjunction with lower average unit selling prices  partially offset by increased service and power supply revenue 
power supply revenue has doubled year over year while service revenue increased by approximately 
revenues from tape libraries and drives decreased to million  or of revenues  in the year ended june   from million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  we anticipate sales of our new enterprise level xls product line to contribute to tape library revenues in fiscal we also expect continued growth as a percentage of sales in our power supply revenues during fiscal we expect service revenue to remain flat as a percentage of sales in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is primarily due to lower revenues resulting in lower absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses  additional inventory reserves and lower average selling 
table of contents prices 
we expect our gross margin percentage in the first half of fiscal to decrease  and then increase slightly as the xls product line sales increase in the second half of fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  is due primarily to lower salaries associated with a decrease in headcount  as our xls product line transitioned from the development phase to the design verification phase  lower prototype material costs and lower consulting fees 
we anticipate research and development expenses to remain the same in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million  or  can be attributed primarily to a decrease in promotion and travel related expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in fiscal related to the launch of our xls product line

provision for income taxes decreased from million in fiscal to a benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal the decrease of million is due to the reversal of a reserve established in fiscal against research and development credits that were refunded in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  were million  a decrease of compared to net revenues of million for the year ended june  the decrease in revenues was due primarily to a decline in the demand for our tape libraries using mm ait tape technology and to a lesser extent  half inch tape technology 
revenues from libraries incorporating ait tape technology were lower due to customer preferences shifting to the higher capacity half inch technology tape drives  caused  in part  by the delayed availability of ait tape drives 
moreover  when ait tape drives did become available  they were not backward read write compatible with earlier generations of ait tape drives 
both of these factors negatively impacted our upgrade business in our large ait customer base 
revenues incorporating half inch technology exceeded revenues incorporating mm technology in absolute dollars in fiscal in fiscal  by comparison  revenues were divided about evenly between mm and half inch tape technologies in absolute dollars 
however  revenues from libraries incorporating half inch technology decreased from fiscal as the second and third quarters of fiscal benefited from a large non recurring library order of approximately million 
revenues from tape libraries and drives decreased to million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  from million  or of revenues  in the year ended june  although selling prices of our libraries dropped during fiscal  average selling prices of libraries increased during fiscal due to a change in product mix 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of revenues  for the year ended june   compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was attributed to lower manufacturing overhead absorption due to lower revenues as well as to lower selling prices due to greater competitive pricing pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the 
table of contents year ended june  this decrease in absolute dollars was due primarily to lower prototype material costs and salaries  partly offset by higher consulting costs  as the next generation of tape libraries transitions from the development phase to the pilot production phase 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million  or of revenues for the year ended june   as compared to million  or of revenues  for the year ended june  the decrease in absolute dollars can be attributed primarily to a reduction in advertising and outside commission expenses

investment income and impairment loss for other than temporary decline in investments 
investment income increased to  for the year ended june  as compared to net investment income of  in fiscal the increase is attributed to lowering the average duration of our portfolio to capture the higher short term yields available in the current higher interest rate environment 
in addition  an impairment loss for other than temporary decline in investments of  was recognized in fiscal earnings due to the adoption of emerging issues task force no 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  or of pre tax loss  for fiscal compared to a benefit of  or of pre tax loss  for fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal can be primarily attributed to establishing full valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets based on our assessment regarding the realizability of these benefits in future years offset by the recognition of research and development credits to be received 
in fiscal  the low effective tax benefit rate was primarily attributed to establishing valuation allowances for capital losses realized on a tax basis in fiscal and net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash used by operating activities was million in fiscal  and cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  a breakeven in operating cash resulted from the receipt of research and development credit refunds and a decrease in accounts receivable  offset by a net loss for the year

summary of contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our future payments due under contractual obligations as of june  operating purchase year ended june leases obligations total in thousands purchase obligations in the table above represent the value of open purchase orders as of june  we believe that some of these obligations could be canceled for payment of a nominal penalty or no penalty  however  the amount of open purchase orders that could be canceled under such terms is difficult to quantify 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in shorter duration securities 
we have no outstanding debt nor do we utilize derivative financial instruments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
