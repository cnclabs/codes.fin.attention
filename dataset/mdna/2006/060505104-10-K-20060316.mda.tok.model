notes to consolidated financial statements referred to in management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are incorporated by reference into management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
restatement as discussed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements  we are restating our historical financial statements for the years and  for the quarters in and  and other selected financial data for the years and see tables and on pages and for the restatements of five year summary of selected financial data  and supplemental financial data and reconciliations to gaap financial measures 
these restatements and resulting revisions relate to the accounting treatment for certain derivative transactions under the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
the corporation is presenting this restatement in its annual report on form k 
the corporation uses interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts in its asset and liability management alm process 
use of such derivatives enables us to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate and currency rate volatility 
the corporation had applied hedge accounting for certain derivative transactions that we believe met the requirements of sfas the application of hedge accounting produced financial statement results that were consistent with the economics of these transactions and our risk management activities 
hedge accounting reduces volatility in earnings by counterbalancing the changes in the hedged item and the derivative 
as a result of a recent interpretation on the shortcut method for derivative instruments under sfas  the corporation undertook a review of all hedge accounting transactions  which was completed in the first quarter of based on the review  we determined that certain hedges did not meet the requirements of sfas since we could not apply hedge accounting for those transactions  the derivative transactions have been marked to market through our consolidated statement of income with no related offset for hedge accounting 
accordingly  changes in interest rates and currency rates which impact the fair value of derivative instruments have had a direct impact on our net income 

table of contents the following tables set forth the effect of the adjustments described above on net income for the years ended december     and and for the quarterly periods in and although the year and fourth quarter of are not restated  this information was previously provided in the corporation s current report on form k filed on january   and therefore  is included as part of the restatement information

for presentation purposes  certain numbers have been rounded 
the corporation provided unaudited financial information relating to the fourth quarter of in its current report on form k filed on january  during the first quarter of  the corporation terminated certain derivatives used as economic hedges as part of the alm process that did not qualify for sfas hedge accounting and entered into new derivative contracts to hedge certain of its exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
these new contracts are designated in hedging relationships and meet the requirement for sfas hedge accounting 
prior to the termination of the economic hedges noted above  the changes in fair value of such contracts were recorded in other income and had a direct impact on net income 
as a result  we estimate that net income will be reduced by approximately per share in the first quarter of 
table of contents effects of the restatement the following tables set forth the effects of the restatement relating to derivative transactions on major caption items within our consolidated statement of income for the years and  and our consolidated balance sheet as of december  although the year and fourth quarter of are not restated  this information was previously provided in the corporation s current report on form k filed on january   and therefore  is included as part of the restatement information

for derivative instruments previously accounted for as fair value hedges  the net accruals for the derivatives were recorded to net interest income  and net changes in fair values of the derivative instruments as a result of changes in rates were recorded as basis adjustments to the hedged items  such as loans and leases  and long term debt 
as a result of the restatement  the previous accounting treatment was reversed ie  the net accruals recorded to net interest income were reversed and there was no basis adjustment for the hedged items  and the total changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments including interest accrual settlements were recorded directly to other income 
in addition  for derivative instruments that were previously accounted for as cash flow hedges  the corporation recorded accruals from the derivative instruments to net interest income and recorded net changes in the fair values of the derivatives  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
as a result of the restatement  the cash flow hedge effects were reversed from accumulated oci and net interest income  and recorded in other income 
accordingly  net interest income decreased million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other income decreased million in  and increased million and million in and the change in other income included in total noninterest income after the restatement adjustments was primarily due to the effects of changes in rates in each respective year on the fair values of derivative instruments used in the alm process 
these derivative instruments were primarily comprised of receive fixed interest rate swaps  long futures and forward contracts  which generally increase in value when interest rates fall  and decrease in value when interest rates rise 
gains on sales of debt securities declined from the previously reported results by million in the third quarter of the previously reported results did not recognize cash flow hedge losses upon sale of the underlying hedged securities 
this cash flow hedge utilized a forward purchase agreement to hedge the variability in cash flows from the anticipated purchase of securities 
the corporation subsequently sold the related securities and did not previously reclassify the loss on the forward purchase agreement from accumulated oci into income

additionally  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that previously qualified for cash flow hedge accounting were reversed from accumulated oci and recorded in income 
tax effects of these adjustments impacted accrued expenses and other liabilities 
accordingly  as of december  and  this resulted in an increase of million and a decrease of million in loans and leases  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million and million  a decrease in long term debt of million and million  an increase in retained earnings of million and million  and a decrease in accumulated oci of million and million

economic overview in  economic performance was strong  despite a near doubling in energy prices  persistent hikes in the federal funds rate and the destructive hurricanes in the second half of in the united states  real gross domestic product rose a solid percent 
global economic expansion was healthy  as robust growth in asian nations was offset by weaker activity in core european nations 
in the us  consumer spending was particularly resilient to the higher energy prices that reduced real purchasing power 
rising employment and wages lifted personal income and financial wealth reached an all time high  while the rate of personal savings fell again 
following several years of robust increases in real estate activity and housing values  real estate softened in the second half of and the volume of mortgage refinancing receded 
heightened efficiencies generated sustained productivity gains that constrained costs of production and contributed to record breaking operating profits and cash flows 
while business investment spending was strong and employment gains firm  inventories remained lean 
the strong business performance generated growth in business lending and supported healthy credit quality 
although the higher energy prices pushed up headline inflation  core inflation  which excludes the volatile food and energy prices  remained low 
the federal reserve raised rates at every federal open market committee meeting in  lifting the federal funds rate to percent at year end 
however  these rate hikes were widely anticipated  contributing to very low bond yields and a significantly flatter yield curve

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased billion to billion in with credit card being the primary driver of the increase 
consumer credit card net charge offs increased billion from to billion with an estimated million related to the increase in bankruptcy filings prior to the effective date of the new bankruptcy legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of we estimate that approximately percent of these bankruptcy related charge offs represent acceleration from and were provided for previously 
also impacting credit card net charge offs and the provision for credit losses were organic growth and seasoning of the portfolio  the impact of the fleetboston portfolio and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
the provision also increased as the rate of credit quality improvement slowed in the commercial portfolio and a million reserve was established for estimated losses associated with hurricane katrina 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in the reserves of million due to reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit related integration activities for fleetboston

supplemental financial data table provides a reconciliation of the supplemental financial data mentioned below with financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently 
operating basis presentation in managing our business  we may at times look at performance excluding certain non recurring items 
for example  as an alternative to net income  we view results on an operating basis  which represents net income excluding merger and restructuring charges 
the operating basis of presentation is not defined by gaap 
we believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges  which represent events outside our normal operations  provides a meaningful year to year comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations 
net interest income fte basis in addition  we view net interest income and related ratios and analysis ie efficiency ratio  net interest yield and operating leverage on a fte basis 
although this is a non gaap measure  we believe managing the business with net interest income on a fte basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
to derive the fte basis  net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
for purposes of this calculation  we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent 
this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
performance measures as mentioned above  certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio  net interest yield  and operating leverage utilize net interest income and thus total revenue on a fte basis 
the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue  and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds 
operating leverage measures the total percentage revenue growth minus the total percentage expense growth for the corresponding period 
during our annual integrated planning process  we set operating leverage and efficiency targets for the corporation and each line of business 
targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors  including maturity of the business  investment appetite  competitive environment  market factors  and other items eg risk appetite 
the aforementioned performance measures and ratios  earnings per common share eps  return on average assets  return on average common shareholders equity and dividend payout ratio  as well as those measures discussed more fully below  are presented in table return on average common shareholders equity  return on average tangible common shareholders equity and shareholder value added we also evaluate our business based upon return on average common shareholders equity roe  return on average tangible common shareholders equity rote and shareholder value added sva measures 
roe  rote and sva utilize non gaap allocation methodologies 
roe measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit 
rote measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity reduced by goodwill  core deposit intangibles and other intangibles  allocated to that unit 
sva is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital 
for more information  see basis of presentation beginning on page these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity ie capital at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation 
using sva as a performance measure places specific focus on whether incremental investments generate returns in excess of the costs of capital associated with those investments 
investments and initiatives are analyzed using sva during the annual planning process for maximizing allocation of corporate resources 
in addition  profitability  relationship and investment models all use roe and sva as key measures to support our overall growth goal

table of contents core net interest income managed basis in managing our business  we review core net interest income on a managed basis  which adjusts reported net interest income on a fte basis for the impact of trading related activities and revolving securitizations 
as discussed in the global capital markets and investment banking business segment section beginning on page  we evaluate our trading results and strategies based on total trading related revenue  calculated by combining trading related net interest income with trading account profits 
we also adjust for loans that we originated and sold into revolving credit card  home equity line and commercial loan securitizations 
noninterest income  rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses  is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations  where appropriate

also during the third quarter of  we announced the future combination of global business and financial services and global capital markets and investment banking that was effective on january  this new 
table of contents segment is called global corporate and investment banking 
this new segment will enable us to more effectively leverage the universal bank model in servicing our business clients 
in the universal bank model  teams of consumer  commercial and investment bankers work together to provide all clients  regardless of size  the right combination of products and services to meet their needs 
all other consists primarily of equity investments  the residual impact of the allowance for credit losses process  merger and restructuring charges  intersegment eliminations  and the results of certain consumer finance and commercial lending businesses that are being liquidated 
all other also includes certain amounts associated with the alm process  including the impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies  amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations that do not qualify for sfas hedge accounting treatment  gains or losses on sales of whole mortgage loans  and gains on sales of debt securities 
for more information on all other  see page basis of presentation we prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non gaap methodologies and performance measures many of which are discussed in supplemental financial data on page we begin by evaluating the operating results of the businesses  which by definition excludes merger and restructuring charges 
the segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies  which are utilized to determine operating income 
the net interest income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics 
net interest income also reflects an allocation of net interest income generated by assets and liabilities used in our alm process 
the results of the business segments will fluctuate based on the performance of corporate alm activities 
the restatement impact to net interest income  associated with the economic hedges that did not qualify for sfas hedge accounting  was included in all other  and was not allocated to the business segments 
certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments based on pre determined means 
the most significant of these expenses include data processing costs  item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions 
data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage 
item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment 
the costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies which reflect utilization 
equity is allocated to the business segments using a risk adjusted methodology incorporating each unit s credit  market and operational risk components 
the nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page roe is calculated by dividing net income by allocated equity 
sva is defined as cash basis earnings on an operating basis less a charge for the use of capital ie equity 
cash basis earnings on an operating basis is defined as net income adjusted to exclude merger and restructuring charges  and amortization of intangibles 
the charge for capital is calculated by multiplying percent management s estimate of the shareholders minimum required rate of return on capital invested by average total common shareholders equity at the corporate level and by average allocated equity at the business segment level 
average equity is allocated to the business level using a methodology identical to that used in the roe calculation 
management reviews the estimate of the rate used to calculate the capital charge annually 
the capital asset pricing model is used to estimate our cost of capital 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional business segment information  selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue and net income amounts

growth in deposits  a low cost source of funding  positively impacted net interest income 
average deposits increased billion  or eight percent  driven by the impact of fleetboston customers  deepening existing relationships and our focus on attracting new customers 
partially offsetting this growth was the migration of account balances of billion from global consumer and small business banking to global wealth and investment management 
net interest income was also positively impacted by the billion  or percent  increase in average loans and leases 
this increase was driven by higher average balances on home equity loans and lines of credit and average held credit card outstandings 
the growth in held credit card outstandings was due to the impact of fleetboston  increases in purchase volumes  the addition of more than million new accounts primarily through our branch network and direct marketing programs  and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
noninterest income increased billion  or percent  in the increase was primarily due to increases of billion  or percent  in card income  million  or percent  in service charges and million in mortgage banking income 
card income increased mainly due to higher purchase volumes for credit and debit cards  the impact of the npc acquisition in the fourth quarter of  and increases in average managed credit card outstandings 
the increases in card purchase volumes and average managed credit card outstandings were due to continued growth in our card business as we more effectively leveraged our branch network 
the increase in service charges was due primarily 
table of contents to the growth in new accounts 
mortgage banking income increased primarily due to a million decrease in the impairment of msrs 
also impacting these increases was the impact of fleetboston 
the provision for credit losses increased million  or percent  to billion in mainly due to credit card 
for further discussion of the increased provision for credit losses related to credit card  see the following section  card services 
noninterest expense grew million  or seven percent in the majority of the increase was due to the impact of fleetboston and npc 
card services card services  which excludes debit cards  provides a broad offering of credit cards to an array of customers including consumers and small businesses 
our products include traditional credit cards  and a variety of co branded and affinity card products 
we also provide processing services for merchant card receipts  a business where we are a market leader  due in part to our acquisition of npc during the fourth quarter of we evaluate our card services business on both a held and managed basis a non gaap measure 
managed basis treats securitized loan receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet and presents the earnings on the sold loan receivables as if they were not sold 
we evaluate credit card operations on a managed basis as the receivables that have been securitized are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as the held loans 
the credit performance of the managed portfolio is important to understanding the results of card operations 

table of contents the following table reconciles the credit card portfolio on a held basis to a managed basis to reflect the impact of securitizations 
for assets that have been securitized  we record noninterest income  rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses  as we are compensated for servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations 
in a securitization  the credit card receivables  not the ongoing relationships  are sold to the trust 
after the revolving period of the securitization  assuming no new securitizations  the newly generated credit card receivables arising from these relationships are recorded on our balance sheet 
this has the effect of increasing loans and leases and increasing net interest income and the provision for credit losses including net charge offs  with a reduction in noninterest income

strong credit card growth drove card services revenue in held credit card revenue increased billion  or percent  to billion 
contributing to this increase was the million increase in held net interest income  due to a billion  or percent  increase in average held credit card outstandings 
the increase in average held credit card outstandings was due to the impact of fleetboston  increases in purchase volumes  the addition of more than million new accounts primarily through our branch network and direct marketing programs  and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
also driving card services held revenue was an increase in noninterest income of million  or percent  in the increase resulted from higher merchant discount fees  interchange fees  cash advance fees and late fees 
merchant discount fees increased million primarily due to the acquisition of npc 
interchange fees increased million mainly due to a billion  or percent  increase in consumer credit card purchase volumes 
cash advance fees increased million due to higher balance transfers 
late fees increased million in 
table of contents held provision for credit losses increased million to billion in  driven primarily by higher net charge offs 
consumer card net charge offs were billion  or percent in compared to billion  or percent in higher credit card net charge offs were driven by an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs of million as card customers rushed to file ahead of the new bankruptcy law 
also impacting net charge offs were organic portfolio growth and seasoning  increases effective in in credit card minimum payment requirements  the impact of fleetboston and new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
we estimate that approximately percent of the increased bankruptcy related charge offs represent acceleration from excluding bankruptcy related charge offs representing acceleration from and charge offs associated with the changes in credit card minimum payment requirements that were provided for in late  the increased net charge offs were the primary driver of the higher provision for credit losses 
in addition  the provision for credit losses was impacted by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts  and the establishment of reserves in for additional changes made in late in credit card minimum payment requirements 
managed card revenue increased billion  or percent  to billion in  driven by a million  or nine percent  increase in managed net interest income  and a million  or percent increase  in managed noninterest income 
average managed credit card outstandings were billion in compared to billion in the impact of fleetboston and organic growth drove the increases in managed consumer credit card net losses were billion  or percent of total average managed credit card loans in  compared to billion  or percent in higher managed credit card net losses were driven by an increase in bankruptcy net losses resulting from the change in the bankruptcy law  continued growth and seasoning  increases effective in in credit card minimum payment requirements and the impact of fleetboston

total revenue for all other increased million to million in  primarily driven by an increase in equity investment gains in offsetting this increase was the decline in fair value of derivative instruments which were used as economic hedges of interest and foreign exchange rates as part of the alm process 
changes in value of these derivative instruments were due to interest rate fluctuations during the year 
provision for credit losses decreased million to million in  resulting from changes to components of the formula and other factors effective in  and reduced credit costs in associated with previously exited businesses 
these decreases were offset in part by the establishment of a million reserve for estimated losses associated with hurricane katrina 
gains on sales of debt securities decreased million primarily due to lower gains realized in on mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds than in securities gains are the result of the repositioning of the securities portfolio to manage interest rate fluctuations and mortgage prepayment risk 
the corporation utilized a forward purchase agreement to hedge the variability of cash flows from the anticipated purchase of securities 
the corporation subsequently sold the related securities and did not originally reclassify the loss from accumulated oci at the time the related securities were sold

these markets provide an attractive  lower cost financing alternative for our customers 
our customers sell assets  such as high grade trade or other receivables or leases  to a commercial paper financing entity  which in turn issues high grade short term commercial paper that is collateralized by the underlying assets 
additionally  some customers receive the benefit of commercial paper financing rates related to certain lease arrangements 
we facilitate these transactions and collect fees from the financing entity for the services it provides including administration  trust services and marketing the commercial paper 
we receive fees for providing combinations of liquidity  standby letters of credit sblcs or similar loss protection commitments  and derivatives to the commercial paper financing entities 
these forms of asset support are senior to the first layer of asset support provided by customers through over collateralization or by support provided by third parties 
the rating agencies require that a certain percentage of the commercial paper entity s assets be supported by the seller s over collateralization and our sblc in order to receive their respective investment rating 
the sblc would be drawn on only when the over collateralization provided by the seller is not sufficient to cover losses of the related asset 
liquidity commitments made to the commercial paper entity are designed to fund scheduled redemptions of commercial paper if there is a market disruption or the new commercial paper cannot be issued to fund the redemption of the maturing commercial paper 
the liquidity facility has the same legal priority as the commercial paper 
we do not enter into any other form of guarantee with these entities

assets sold to the entities consist of high grade corporate or municipal bonds  collateralized debt obligations and asset backed securities 
these entities issue collateralized commercial paper or notes with similar repricing characteristics to third party market participants and passive derivative instruments to us 
assets sold to the entities typically have an investment rating ranging from aaa aaa to aa aa 
we may provide liquidity  sblcs or similar loss protection commitments to the entity  or we may enter into derivatives with the entity in which we assume certain risks 
the liquidity facility and derivatives have the same legal standing with the commercial paper 
the derivatives provide interest rate  currency and a pre specified amount of credit protection to the entity in exchange for the commercial paper rate 
these derivatives are provided for in the legal documents and help to alleviate any cash flow mismatches 
in some cases  if an asset s rating declines below a certain investment quality as evidenced by its investment rating or defaults  we are no longer exposed to the risk of loss 
at that time  the commercial paper holders assume the risk of loss 
in other cases  we agree to assume all of the credit exposure related to the referenced asset 
legal documents for each entity specify asset quality levels that require the entity to automatically dispose of the asset once the asset falls below the specified quality rating 
at the time the asset is disposed  we are required to reimburse the entity for any credit related losses depending on the pre specified level of protection provided

credit and liquidity risks because we provide liquidity and credit support to the commercial paper conduits and qspes described above  our credit ratings and changes thereto will affect the borrowing cost and liquidity of these entities 
in addition  significant changes in counterparty asset valuation and credit standing may also affect the liquidity of the commercial paper issuance 
disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in our having to fund under these commitments and sblcs discussed above

we may provide liquidity support in the form of foreign exchange or interest rate swaps 
we generally do not provide other forms of credit support to these entities  which are described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the above  we had significant involvement with variable interest entities vies other than the commercial paper conduits

managing risk overview our management governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated planning and review process that includes strategic  financial  associate  customer and risk planning 
we derive much of our revenue from managing risk from customer transactions for profit 
in addition to qualitative factors  we utilize quantitative measures to optimize risk and reward trade offs in order to achieve growth targets and financial objectives while reducing the variability of earnings and minimizing unexpected losses 
risk metrics that allow us to measure performance include economic capital targets  sva targets and corporate risk limits 
by allocating capital to a business unit  we effectively define that unit s ability to take on risk 
country  trading  asset allocation and other limits supplement the allocation of economic capital 
these limits are based on an analysis of risk and reward in each business unit and management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits 
our risk management process continually evaluates risk and appropriate metrics needed to measure it 
our business exposes us to the following major risks strategic  liquidity  credit  market and operational 
strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  execution and or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives 
liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations 
market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions  such as interest rate movements 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or external events 
risk management processes and methods we have established control processes and use various methods to align risk taking and risk management throughout our organization 
these control processes and methods are designed around three lines of defense lines of business  support units including risk management  compliance  finance  human resources and legal  and corporate audit 
management is responsible for identifying  quantifying  mitigating and managing all risks within their lines of business  while certain enterprise wide risks are managed centrally 
for example  except for trading related business activities  interest rate risk associated with our business activities is managed in the corporate treasury and corporate investment functions 
line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and  therefore  we believe is best able to take actions to manage and mitigate those risks 
our lines of business prepare quarterly self assessment reports to identify the status of risk issues  including mitigation plans  if 
table of contents appropriate 
these reports roll up to executive management to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight  and to identify enterprise wide issues 
our management processes  structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision making and accountability 
wherever practical  we attempt to house decision making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both in and outside of the lines of business 
the risk management organization translates approved business plans into approved limits  approves requests for changes to those limits  approves transactions as appropriate  and works closely with lines of business to establish and monitor risk parameters 
risk management has assigned a risk executive to each of the lines of business who is responsible for the oversight of all risks associated with that line of business 
in addition  risk management has assigned risk executives to monitor enterprise wide credit  market and operational risks 
corporate audit provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems 
corporate audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected  significant financial  managerial and operating information is materially complete  accurate and reliable  and employees actions are in compliance with corporate policies  standards  procedures  and applicable laws and regulations 
we use various methods to manage risks at the line of business levels and corporate wide 
examples of these methods include planning and forecasting  risk committees and forums  limits  models  and hedging strategies 
planning and forecasting facilitates analysis of actual versus planned results and provides an indication of unanticipated risk levels 
generally  risk committees and forums are comprised of lines of business  risk management  treasury  compliance  legal and finance personnel  among others  who actively monitor performance against plan  limits  potential issues  and introduction of new products 
limits  the amount of exposure that may be taken in a product  relationship  region or industry  seek to align risk goals with those of each line of business and are part of our overall risk management process to help reduce the volatility of market  credit and operational losses 
models are used to estimate market value and net interest income sensitivity  and to estimate expected and unexpected losses for each product and line of business  where appropriate 
hedging strategies are used to manage the risk of borrower or counterparty concentration risk and to manage market risk in the portfolio 
the formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process 
corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management 
through our code of ethics  we set a high standard for our associates 
the code of ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers 
we instill a risk conscious culture through communications  training  policies  procedures  and organizational roles and responsibilities 
additionally  we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward corporate wide risk goals 
oversight the board evaluates risk through the chief executive officer ceo and three committees 
the finance committee  a committee appointed by the board  establishes policies and strategies for managing the strategic  liquidity  credit  market and operational risks to corporate earnings and capital 
the asset quality committee  a board committee  reviews credit and selected market risks  and the audit committee  a board committee  provides direct oversight of the corporate audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm 
additionally  senior management oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities is conducted through four senior management committees the risk and capital committee rcc  the asset and liability committee alco  the compliance and operational risk committee corc and the credit risk committee crc 
the rcc  a senior management committee  reviews corporate strategies and corporate objectives  evaluates business performance  and reviews business plans  including capital allocation  for the corporation and for major businesses 
the alco  a subcommittee of the finance committee  provides oversight for corporate treasury s and corporate investment s process of managing interest rate risk  otherwise known as the alm process  and reviews alm and credit hedging activities 
alco also approves limits for trading activities and manages the risk of loss of value and related net interest income of our trading activities 
the corc  a subcommittee of the finance committee  provides oversight and consistent communication of operational and compliance issues 
the crc  a subcommittee of the finance committee  establishes corporate credit practices and limits  including industry and country concentration limits and approval requirements 
the crc also reviews asset quality results versus plan  portfolio management  and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
each committee and subcommittee has the ability to delegate authority to officers of subcommittees to manage specific risks 
management continues to direct corporate wide efforts to address the basel committee on banking supervision s new risk based capital standards basel ii 
the finance committee and the audit committee provide oversight of management s plans including the corporation s preparedness and compliance with basel ii 
for additional information  see basel ii on page and note of the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections  strategic risk management  liquidity risk and capital management  credit risk management beginning on page  market risk management beginning on page and operational risk management 
table of contents beginning on page  address in more detail the specific procedures  measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage 
strategic risk management the board provides oversight for strategic risk through the ceo and the finance committee 
we use an integrated business planning process to help manage strategic risk 
a key component of the planning process aligns strategies  goals  tactics and resources 
the process begins with an assessment that creates a plan for the corporation  setting the corporate strategic direction 
the planning process then cascades through the business units  creating business unit plans that are aligned with the corporation s direction 
tactics and metrics are monitored to ensure adherence to the plans 
as part of this monitoring  business units perform a quarterly self assessment further described in the operational risk management section beginning on page this assessment looks at changing market and business conditions  and the overall risk in meeting objectives 
corporate audit in turn monitors  and independently reviews and evaluates  the plans and self assessments 
one of the key tools for managing strategic risk is capital allocation 
through allocating capital  we effectively manage each business segment s ability to take on risk 
review and approval of business plans incorporates approval of capital allocation  and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting 
liquidity risk and capital management liquidity risk liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and business operations  and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events 
sources of liquidity include deposits and other customer based funding  wholesale market based funding  and liquidity provided by the sale or securitization of assets 
we manage liquidity at two levels 
the first is the liquidity of the parent company  which is the holding company that owns the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries 
the second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiaries 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the parent company and banking subsidiaries each have different funding needs and sources  and each are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements 
through alco  the finance committee is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy as well as approving operating and contingency procedures  and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis 
corporate treasury is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategy 
in order to ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions  we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability  flexibility  and diversity 
key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on customer based funding  maintaining direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers  and maintaining the ability to liquefy certain assets when  and if  requirements warrant 
we develop and maintain contingency funding plans for both the parent company and bank liquidity positions 
these plans evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate though a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
they are reviewed and approved annually by alco 
our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings 
the credit ratings of bank of america corporation and bank of america  national association bank of america  na are reflected in the table below 
table credit ratings december  bank of america corporation bank of america  na senior debt subordinated debt commercial paper short term borrowings long term debt moody s aa aa p p aa standard poor s aa a a a aa fitch  inc aa a f f aa 
table of contents under normal business conditions  primary sources of funding for the parent company include dividends received from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt  as well as commercial paper and equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt and commercial paper  share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders  and subsidiary funding through capital or debt 
the parent company maintains a cushion of excess liquidity that would be sufficient to fully fund holding company and nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period during which funding from normal sources is disrupted 
the primary measure used to assess the parent company s liquidity is the time to required funding during such a period of liquidity disruption 
this measure assumes that the parent company is unable to generate funds from debt or equity issuance  receives no dividend income from subsidiaries  and no longer pays dividends to shareholders while continuing to meet nondiscretionary uses needed to maintain bank operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent company and affiliated companies 
under this scenario  the amount of time the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered the time to required funding 
alco approves the target range set for this metric  in months  and monitors adherence to the target 
maintaining excess parent company cash that ensures that time to required funding remains in the target range is the primary driver of the timing and amount of the corporation s debt issuances 
as of december  time to required funding was months 
the primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits  wholesale market based funding  and asset securitizations 
primary uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include growth in the core asset portfolios  including loan demand  and in the alm portfolio 
we use the alm portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
the strength of our balance sheet is a result of rigorous financial and risk discipline 
our excess deposits  which are a low cost of funding source  fund the purchase of additional securities and result in a lower loan to deposit ratio 
mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans have prepayment risk which has to be actively managed 
repricing of deposits is a key variable in this process 
the capital generated in excess of capital adequacy targets and to support business growth  is available for the payment of dividends and share repurchases 
alco determines prudent parameters for wholesale market based borrowing and regularly reviews the funding plan for the bank subsidiaries to ensure compliance with these parameters 
the contingency funding plan for the banking subsidiaries evaluates liquidity over a month period in a variety of business environment scenarios assuming different levels of earnings performance and credit ratings as well as public and investor relations factors 
funding exposure related to our role as liquidity provider to certain off balance sheet financing entities is also measured under a stress scenario 
in this analysis  ratings are downgraded such that the off balance sheet financing entities are not able to issue commercial paper and backup facilities that we provide are drawn upon 
in addition  potential draws on credit facilities to issuers with ratings below a certain level are analyzed to assess potential funding exposure 
one ratio used to monitor the stability of our funding composition is the loan to domestic deposit ltd ratio 
this ratio reflects the percent of loans and leases that are funded by domestic customer deposits  a relatively stable funding source 
a ratio below percent indicates that our loan portfolio is completely funded by domestic customer deposits 
the ratio was percent at december  compared to percent at december  the increase was primarily attributable to organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio 
we originate loans for retention on our balance sheet and for distribution 
as part of our originate to distribute strategy  commercial loan originations are distributed through syndication structures  and residential mortgages originated by consumer real estate are frequently distributed in the secondary market 
in connection with our balance sheet management activities  we may retain mortgage loans originated as well as purchase and sell loans based on our assessment of market conditions 
regulatory capital as a regulated financial services company  we are governed by certain regulatory capital requirements 
presented in note of the consolidated financial statements are the regulatory capital ratios  actual capital amounts and minimum required capital amounts for the corporation  bank of america  na  fleet national bank and bank of america  na usa at december  and on june   fleet national bank merged with and into bank of america  na  with bank of america  na as the surviving entity 
as of december   the entities were classified as well capitalized for regulatory purposes  the highest classification 
certain corporate sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities trust securities are deconsolidated under fin r 
as a result  the trust securities are not included on our consolidated balance sheets 
on march   the frb issued risk based capital standards trust preferred securities and the definition of capital the final rule which allows trust securities to continue to qualify as tier capital with revised quantitative limits that would be effective after a five year transition period 
as a result  we continue to include trust securities in tier capital 

table of contents the frb s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to percent for internationally active bank holding companies 
in addition  the frb revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital 
internationally active bank holding companies are those with consolidated assets greater than billion or on balance sheet exposure greater than billion 
at december   our restricted core capital elements comprised percent of total core capital elements 
we expect to be fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of march  basel ii in june  basel ii was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks 
similar to economic capital measures  basel ii seeks to address credit risk  market risk and operational risk 
while economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses  we also maintain a certain threshold in terms of regulatory capital to adhere to legal standards of capital adequacy 
with recent updates to the us implementation  these thresholds or leverage ratios  will continue to be utilized for the foreseeable future 
maintaining capital adequacy with our regulatory capital under basel ii  does not impact internal profitability or pricing 
in the us  basel ii will not be implemented until january   which will serve as our parallel test year  followed by full implementation in the impact on our capital management processes and capital requirements continues to be evaluated 
as basel ii is an international regulation  us regulatory agencies are drafting a us oriented measure which follows the basel ii construct 
recently  an assessment of the potential effect on regulatory capital known as quantitative impact study was completed  which generated disparate results among participants 
in order to address the potential changes in capital levels  regulators have established floors or limits as to how much capital can decrease from period to period after full implementation through at least we are committed to working with the regulators and continue to proactively monitor their efforts towards achieving a successful implementation of basel ii 
implementation of basel ii requires a significant enterprise wide effort 
during  our dedicated basel ii program management office  supported by a number of business segment specialists and technologists  completed major planning activities required to achieve basel ii preparedness 
during  we are aggressively moving forward with policy  process and technology changes required to achieve full compliance by the start of parallel processing in we continue to work closely with the regulatory agencies in this process 
dividends effective for the third quarter dividend  the board increased the quarterly cash dividend percent from to per common share 
in october  the board declared a fourth quarter cash dividend which was paid on december  to common shareholders of record on december  in january  the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  share repurchases we will continue to repurchase shares  from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions through our approved repurchase programs 
we repurchased million shares of common stock in  which more than offset the million shares issued under our company s employee stock plans 
during we expect to use available excess capital to repurchase shares in excess of shares issued under our employee stock plans 
for additional information on common share repurchases  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations 
credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an advance  commitment or investment of funds 
we define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications  including loans and leases  derivatives  trading account assets  assets held for sale  and unfunded lending commitments that include loan commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
for derivative positions  our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts 
we use the current mark to market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark to market changes 
the credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements 
our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account credit exposures that are funded or unfunded 
for additional information on derivatives and credit extension commitments  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty  repayment sources  the nature of underlying collateral  and other support given current events  conditions and expectations 
we classify our loans and leases as either consumer or commercial and monitor their credit risk separately as discussed below 
consumer portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower s credit cycle 
statistical techniques are used to establish product pricing  risk appetite  operating processes and metrics to balance risks and returns 
consumer exposure is grouped by product and other attributes for purposes of evaluating credit risk 
statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus as well as internal historical experience 
these models are essential to our consumer credit risk management process and are used in the determination of credit decisions  collections management strategies  portfolio management decisions  determination of the allowance for consumer loan and lease losses  and economic capital allocations for credit risk 
table presents outstanding consumer loans and leases for each year in the five year period ending at december  table outstanding consumer loans and leases december restated restated restated restated dollars in millions amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent residential mortgage credit card home equity lines direct indirect consumer other consumer total consumer loans and leases includes consumer finance of  million   million   million   million  and  million at december      and  respectively  foreign consumer of  million   million   million   million  and  million at december      and  respectively  and consumer lease financing of million  million   million   million  and  million at december      and  respectively 
concentrations of consumer credit risk our consumer credit risk is diversified both geographically and through our various product offerings 
in addition  credit decisions are statistically based with tolerances set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases 
from time to time  we purchase credit protection on certain portions of our consumer portfolio 
this protection is designed to enhance our overall risk management strategy 
at december  and  we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk on approximately billion and billion of residential mortgage and indirect automobile loans through the purchase of credit protection 
our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of these transactions because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties 
these transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk weighted assets by billion and billion at december  and  and resulted in bp and bp increases in our tier capital ratio 
consumer portfolio credit quality performance credit quality continued to be strong and consistent with performance from a year ago with the exception of the credit card portfolio

commercial portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of the borrower s or counterparty s financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower or counterparty  each commercial credit exposure or transaction is assigned a risk rating and is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the borrower s or counterparty s financial condition  cash flow or financial situation 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral  country  industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship and sva 
our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a borrower s or counterparty s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we utilize syndication of exposure to other entities  loan sales and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio

concentrations of commercial credit risk portfolio credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk 
we review  measure  and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry  product  geography and customer relationship 
distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of the portfolio risk diversification 
we also review  measure  and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type 
in addition  within our international portfolio  we evaluate borrowings by region and by country 
tables through summarize these concentrations 
from the perspective of portfolio risk management  customer concentration management is most relevant in global capital markets and investment banking 
within that portfolio  concentrations are actively managed through the underwriting and ongoing monitoring processes  the established strategy of originate to distribute  and partly through the purchase of credit protection through credit derivatives 
we utilize various risk mitigation tools to economically hedge our risk to certain credit counterparties 
credit derivatives are financial instruments that we purchase for protection against the deterioration of credit quality 
earnings volatility increases due to accounting asymmetry as we mark to market the cds  as required by sfas  while the loans are recorded at historical cost less an allowance for credit losses or  if held for sale  at the lower of cost or market

these amounts exclude the impact of our credit hedging activities  which are separately included in the table 
to lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels  credit exposure may be added within an industry  borrower or counterparty group by selling protection 
a negative notional amount indicates a net amount of protection purchased in a particular industry  conversely  a positive notional amount indicates a net amount of protection sold in a particular industry 
credit protection is purchased to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of credit exposure

we routinely review the loan and lease portfolio to determine if any credit exposure should be placed on nonperforming status 
an asset is placed on nonperforming status when it is determined that full collection of principal and or interest in accordance with its contractual terms is not probable 
as presented in table  nonperforming commercial assets decreased million to million at december  due primarily to the million decrease in nonperforming commercial loans and leases

also contributing to the increase in credit card net charge offs were organic growth and seasoning of the portfolio  increases effective in in credit card minimum payment requirements  the impact of the fleetboston portfolio and the impact of new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts 
we estimate that approximately percent of the bankruptcy related charge offs represent acceleration of charge offs from excluding bankruptcy related charge offs representing acceleration from and charge offs associated with the changes in credit card minimum payment requirements that were provided for in late  the increased credit card net charge offs were the primary driver of higher provision for credit losses 
in addition  the provision for credit losses was impacted by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts  and the establishment of reserves in for additional changes made in late in credit card minimum payment requirements 
the establishment of a million reserve associated with hurricane katrina for estimated losses on residential mortgage  home equity and indirect automobile products also contributed to the provision increase 
the commercial portion of the provision for credit losses increased million to negative million 
the negative provision in reflects continued improvement in commercial credit quality  although at a slower pace than experienced in an improved risk profile in latin america and reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit related integration activities for fleetboston also drove the negative provision 
the provision for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments increased million to negative million as the rate of improvement in commercial credit quality slowed 
allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components 
the first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers those commercial loans that are either nonperforming or impaired 
an allowance is allocated when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price are lower than the carrying value of that loan 
for purposes of computing the specific loss component of the allowance  larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product type and risk rating of the loans 
the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing commercial loans and leases  and consumer loans 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating  current economic conditions  industry performance trends  geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment  and any other pertinent information 
the commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of historical loss experience did not have a material impact to the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses 
the allowance for consumer loan and lease losses is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations  generally by product type 
loss forecast models are utilized for consumer products that consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends  delinquencies  economic trends and credit scores 
these consumer loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of the loss forecast models to reflect estimated bankruptcy related net charge offs accelerated from resulted in a decrease in the allowance for consumer loan and lease losses 

table of contents included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are previously unallocated reserves maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including the imprecision inherent in the forecasting methodologies  domestic and global economic uncertainty  large single name defaults and event risk 
in the fourth quarter of  we assigned these reserves to our individual products to better reflect our view of risk in these portfolios 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses 
this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in table increased million from december  to billion at december  credit card accounted for million of this increase and was primarily driven by new advances on accounts for which previous loan balances were sold to the securitization trusts  organic growth and continued seasoning which resulted in higher loss expectations 
these increases were mostly offset by the use of reserves to absorb the estimated bankruptcy net charge off acceleration from increases in the allowance for non credit card consumer products were driven by broad based loan growth and seasoning  with the exception of the other consumer product category which decreased as a result of the run off portfolios from our previously exited consumer businesses 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was billion at december   a million decrease from december  this decrease resulted from continued improvement in commercial credit quality  including reduced exposure and an improved risk profile in latin america  the use of reserves to absorb a portion of domestic airline charge offs and a reduction of reserves due to reduced uncertainties resulting from the completion of credit related integration activities for fleetboston during reserve for unfunded lending commitments in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and financial guarantees  and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews  and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments  and any other pertinent information result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred credit losses upon draws of the commitments 
this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of credit portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios 
changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are made through the provision for credit losses 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at december  was million  a decrease of million from december

interest rate risk is the effect of changes in the economic value of our loans and deposits  as well as our other interest rate sensitive instruments  and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk as part of the alm process 
we seek to mitigate trading risk within our prescribed risk appetite using hedging techniques 
trading positions are reported at estimated market value with changes reflected in income 
trading positions are subject to various risk factors  which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as equity  mortgage  commodity and issuer risk factors 
we seek to mitigate these risk exposures by utilizing a variety of financial instruments 
the following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures we have to instruments whose values vary with the level of interest rates 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  loans  debt securities  certain trading related assets and liabilities  deposits  borrowings and derivative instruments 
we seek to mitigate risks associated with the exposures in a variety of ways that typically involve taking offsetting positions in cash or derivative markets 
the cash and derivative 
table of contents instruments allow us to seek to mitigate risks by reducing the effect of movements in the level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as changes in interest rate volatility 
hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options  futures  forwards and swaps 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures we have to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies 
the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated loans  foreign currency denominated securities  future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions  and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates 
instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options  currency swaps  futures  forwards and deposits 
these instruments help insulate us against losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
mortgage risk our exposure to mortgage risk takes several forms 
first  we trade and engage in market making activities in a variety of mortgage securities  including whole loans  pass through certificates  commercial mortgages  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
second  we originate a variety of asset backed securities  which involves the accumulation of mortgage related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization 
third  we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio 
fourth  we create msrs as part of our mortgage activities 
see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on msrs 
these activities generate market risk since these instruments are sensitive to changes in the level of market interest rates  changes in mortgage prepayments and interest rate volatility 
options  futures  forwards  swaps  swaptions and mortgage backed securities are used to hedge mortgage risk by seeking to mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates 
equity market risk equity market risk arises from exposure to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of common stock or other equity linked instruments 
the instruments held that would lead to this exposure include  but are not limited to  the following common stock  listed equity options puts and calls  over the counter equity options  equity total return swaps  equity index futures and convertible bonds 
we seek to mitigate the risk associated with these securities via hedging on a portfolio or name basis that focuses on reducing volatility from changes in stock prices 
instruments used for risk mitigation include options  futures  swaps  convertible bonds and cash positions 
commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures we have to products traded in the petroleum  natural gas  metals and power markets 
our principal exposure to these markets emanates from customer driven transactions 
these transactions consist primarily of futures  forwards  swaps and options 
we seek to mitigate exposure to the commodity markets with instruments including  but not limited to  options  futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product  as well as cash positions 
issuer credit risk our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted for various reasons directly related to the issuer  such as management performance  financial leverage or reduced demand for the issuer s goods or services 
perceived changes in the creditworthiness of a particular debtor or sector can have significant effects on the replacement costs of cash and derivative positions 
we seek to mitigate the impact of credit spreads  credit migration and default risks on the market value of the trading portfolio with the use of cds  and credit fixed income and similar securities 
trading risk management trading related revenues represent the amount earned from our trading positions  which include trading account assets and liabilities  as well as derivative positions and  prior to the conversion of the certificates into msrs  market value adjustments to the certificates and the msrs 
trading positions are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets 
trading account assets and liabilities  and derivative positions are reported at fair value 
msrs are reported at the lower of cost or market 
for more information on fair value  see complex accounting estimates beginning on page for additional information on msrs  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
trading account profits represent the net amount earned from our trading positions and  as reported in the 
table of contents consolidated statement of income  do not include the net interest income recognized on trading positions  or the related funding charge or benefit 
trading account profits can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever changing market environment 
the histogram of daily revenue or loss below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading related revenue for trading related revenue encompasses proprietary trading and customer related activities 
during  positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days 
furthermore  only six percent of the total trading days had losses greater than million  and the largest loss was million 
this can be compared to  where positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days and only five percent of the total trading days had losses greater than million  and the largest loss was million 
logo to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
at a portfolio and corporate level  we use value at risk var modeling and stress testing 
var is a key statistic used to measure and manage market risk 
trading limits and var are used to manage day to day risks and are subject to testing where we compare expected performance to actual performance 
this testing provides us a view of our models predictive accuracy 
all limit excesses are communicated to senior management for review 
a var model estimates a range of hypothetical scenarios to calculate a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level 
these estimates are impacted by the nature of the positions in the portfolio and the correlation within the portfolio 
within any var model  there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company 
our var model assumes a percent confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  one out of trading days  or two to three times each year 
actual losses did not exceed var in or in addition to reviewing our underlying model assumptions  we seek to mitigate the uncertainties related to these assumptions and estimates through close monitoring and by updating the assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
if the results of our analysis indicate higher than expected levels of risk  proactive measures are taken to adjust risk levels 

table of contents the following graph shows actual losses did not exceed var in logo 
table of contents table presents average  high and low daily var for and table trading activities market risk twelve months ended december var var dollars in millions average high low average high low foreign exchange interest rate credit real estate mortgage equities commodities portfolio diversification total trading portfolio total market based trading portfolio the high and low for the total portfolio may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the individual portfolios may have occurred on different trading days 
credit includes credit fixed income and cds used for credit risk management 
average var for cds was million and million in and in  the credit var was less than var for cds used for credit risk management as the positions in credit fixed income typically offset the risk of cds 
the relationship between overall credit var and the var for cds can change over time as a result of changes in the relative sizes of the credit fixed income and cds exposures 
real estate mortgage includes capital market real estate and the certificates 
effective june   real estate mortgage no longer includes the certificates 
for additional information on the certificates  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
total market based trading portfolio excludes cds used for credit risk management  net of the effect of diversification 
the increase in average var of the trading portfolio for was primarily due to increases in the average risk taken in credit due to an increase in credit protection purchased to hedge the credit risk in our commercial loan portfolio 
stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates  we stress test our portfolio 
stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio due to abnormal market movements 
various stress scenarios are run regularly against the trading portfolio to verify that  even under extreme market moves  we will preserve our capital  to determine the effects of significant historical events  and to determine the effects of specific  extreme hypothetical  but plausible events 
the results of the stress scenarios are calculated daily and reported to senior management as part of the regular reporting process 
the results of certain specific  extreme hypothetical scenarios are presented to the asset and liability committee 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading financial instruments 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect net interest income 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
client facing activities  primarily lending and deposit taking  create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities as well as the impact of changing market conditions is managed through the alm process 
sensitivity simulations are used to estimate the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations estimate levels of short term financial instruments  debt securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and derivative instruments 
in addition  these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
in addition to net interest income sensitivity simulations  market value sensitivity measures are also utilized 
the balance sheet management group maintains a net interest income forecast utilizing different rate scenarios  with the base case utilizing the forward market curve 
the balance sheet management group constantly updates the net interest income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions 
thus  we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to volatile interest rate changes 

table of contents we prepare forward looking forecasts of net interest income 
these baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth  alm positioning  and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the markets forward interest rate curve 
we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have to these static baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions 
the spot and month forward rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at december  and were as follows table forward rates december federal funds ten year constant maturity swap federal funds ten year constant maturity swap spot rates month forward rates the following table reflects the pre tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income over the next twelve months from december  and  resulting from a bp gradual parallel increase  a bp gradual parallel decrease  a bp gradual curve flattening increase in short term rates and a bp gradual curve steepening increase in long tem rates from the forward curve 
table estimated net interest income at risk dollars in millions december curve change short rate long rate restated parallel shift parallel shift flatteners short end long end steepeners short end long end the sensitivity analysis above assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated years 
beyond what is already implied in the forward curve  we are modestly exposed to rising rates primarily due to increased funding costs 
conversely  we would benefit from falling rates or a steepening of the yield curve beyond what is already implied in the forward curve 
as part of the alm process  we use securities  residential mortgages  and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity 
securities the securities portfolio is integral to our alm process 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and regulatory requirements  and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions 
during  we purchased securities of billion  sold billion  and received paydowns of billion 
during  we purchased securities of billion  sold billion  and received paydowns of billion 
during the year  we continuously monitored our interest rate risk position and effected changes in the securities portfolio in order to manage prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
through sales in the securities portfolio  we realized billion in gains on sales of debt securities during and billion during the decrease was primarily due to lower gains realized on mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
residential mortgage portfolio during  we purchased billion of residential mortgages related to the alm process 
we had whole mortgage loan sales of billion during during  we purchased billion of residential mortgages related to the alm process and had minimal sales of whole mortgage loans 
additionally  we received paydowns of billion and billion for and through sales of whole mortgage loans  we recognized gains that were recorded as other income of million for  compared to losses of million in 
table of contents interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm process and serve as an efficient tool to mitigate our risk 
we use derivatives to hedge the changes in cash flows or market values of our balance sheet 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our hedging activities 
our interest rate contracts are generally nonleveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  options  futures  and forwards 
in addition  we use foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  as well as our equity investments in foreign subsidiaries 
table reflects the notional amounts  fair value  weighted average receive fixed and pay fixed rates  expected maturity  and estimated duration of our open alm derivatives at december  and the changes in our swap and option positions reflect actions taken associated with interest rate risk management 
the decisions to reposition our derivative portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment  balance sheet composition and trends  and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions 
the notional amount of our net receive fixed swap position including foreign exchange contracts decreased million to billion at december  compared to december  the notional amount of our net option position decreased billion to billion at december  compared to december  the vast majority of the decrease in the option notional amount was related to terminations and maturities of short duration options which were hedging short term repricing risk of our liabilities 
included in the futures and forward rate contract amounts are billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans at december  settling from january to april with an average yield of percent and billion of forward purchase contracts of mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans at december  that settled from january to february with an average yield of percent 
there were no forward sale contracts of mortgage backed securities at december   compared to billion at december  that settled from january to february with an average yield of percent 

table of contents the following table includes derivatives utilized in our alm process  including those designated as sfas hedges and those used as economic hedges that do not qualify for sfas hedge accounting treatment 
the fair value of net alm contracts decreased from billion at december  to million at december  the decrease was attributable to decreases in the value of options  foreign exchange contracts and futures and forward rate contracts  partially offset by increases in the value of interest rate swaps 
the decrease in the value of options was due to reduction in outstanding option positions due to terminations  maturities and decreases in the values of remaining open options positions 
the decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against most foreign currencies during the decrease in the value of futures and forward rate contracts was due to the impact of increases in interest rates during on long futures and forward rate contracts

for more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the amount included in accumulated oci for terminated derivative contracts was a loss of billion and a gain of million  net of tax  at december  and the decrease was due primarily to the termination of derivative contracts with previously unrealized losses caused by interest rate fluctuations 
mortgage banking risk management interest rate lock commitments irlcs on loans intended to be sold are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the irlc and the date the loan is funded 
loans held for sale are subject to interest rate risk from the date of funding until the loans are sold to the secondary market 
to hedge interest rate risk  we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options 
these instruments are used either as an economic hedge of irlcs and loans held for sale  or designated as a cash flow hedge of loans held for sale  in which case their net of tax unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated oci

operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  including system conversions and integration  and external events 
successful operational risk management is particularly important to a diversified financial services company like ours because of the very nature  volume and complexity of our various businesses 
in keeping with our management governance structure  the lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business including operational risks 
such risks are managed through corporate wide or line of business specific policies and procedures  controls  and monitoring tools 
examples of these include personnel management practices  data reconciliation processes  fraud management units  transaction processing monitoring and analysis  business recovery planning  and new product introduction processes 
we approach operational risk from two perspectives  enterprise wide and line of business specific 
the compliance and operational risk committee  chartered in as a subcommittee of the finance committee  provides consistent communication and oversight of significant operational and compliance issues and oversees the adoption of best practices 
two groups within risk management  compliance risk management and enterprise operational risk 
table of contents management  facilitate the consistency of effective policies  industry best practices  controls and monitoring tools for managing and assessing operational risks across the corporation 
these groups also work with the line of business executives and their risk management counterparts to implement appropriate policies  processes and assessments at the line of business level and support groups 
compliance and operational risk awareness is also driven across the corporation through training and strategic communication efforts 
for selected risks  we establish specialized support groups  for example  information security and supply chain management 
these specialized groups develop corporate wide risk management practices  such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on behalf of the corporation 
these specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses 
at the line of business level  the line of business risk executives are responsible for adherence to corporate practices and oversight of all operational risks in the line of business they support 
operational and compliance risk management  working in conjunction with senior line of business executives  have developed key tools to help manage  monitor and summarize operational risk 
one tool the businesses and executive management utilize is a corporate wide self assessment process  which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk issues  including mitigation plans  if appropriate 
its goal is to continuously assess changing market and business conditions and evaluate all operational risks impacting the line of business 
the self assessment process assists in identifying emerging operational risk issues and determining at the line of business or corporate level how they should be managed 
in addition to information gathered from the self assessment process  key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both a corporate and a line of business level 
more generally  we mitigate operational risk through a broad based approach to process management and process improvement 
improvement efforts are focused on reduction of variation in outputs 
we have a dedicated quality and productivity team to manage and certify the process management and improvement efforts 
recent accounting and reporting developments see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued or proposed accounting pronouncements 
complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities 
we have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments 
the more judgmental estimates are summarized below 
we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation process that  with the exception of accrued taxes  involves mathematical models to derive the estimates 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the model 
where alternatives exist  we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs 
actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables  the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet measurement  often significantly  due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions 
such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant  negative effect on future operating results 
these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is our estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio and within our unfunded lending commitments 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income in the provision for credit losses 
our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the credit risk management section beginning on page and note of the consolidated financial statements 
due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process  estimates of the portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectibility change with changes in the economy  individual industries  countries and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations 
the degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions 
key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases  iv loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases  v adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  vi considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty  and vii overall credit conditions 

table of contents our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and leases and to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios 
assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases  except loans already risk rated doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities  the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately million at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loan and lease outstandings at december  was percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately percent 
a percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios would increase the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  by approximately million  of which million would relate to consumer and million to commercial 
these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal credit ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote 
the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
fair value of financial instruments trading account assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  which is primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions 
liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets or liabilities 
market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions  or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased 
situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector 
in these instances  fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors  principally from reviewing the issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies 
at december   billion  or four percent  of trading account assets were fair valued using these alternative approaches 
an immaterial amount of trading account liabilities were fair valued using these alternative approaches at december  trading account profits  which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions  can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time 
to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
at a portfolio and corporate level  we use trading limits  stress testing and tools such as var modeling  which estimates a potential loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level  to measure and manage market risk 
at december   the amount of our var was million based on a percent confidence level 
for more information on var  see pages through the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity  counterparty credit quality  future servicing costs and other deal specific factors  where appropriate 
to ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities  various processes and controls have been adopted  which include a model validation policy that requires a review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing  financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification  a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations  and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products 
these processes and controls are performed independently of the business segment 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over the counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates  prices  and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors  which are used to value the position 
the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources  including brokers  market transactions and third party pricing services 
estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable  in which case quantitative based extrapolations of rate  price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values 
at december   the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities determined by these quantitative models were billion and billion 
these amounts reflect the full fair value of the derivatives and do not isolate the discrete value associated with the subjective valuation variable 
further  they represent four percent and three percent of derivative assets and liabilities  before the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements 
for the year ended december   there were no changes to the quantitative models  or uses of such models  that resulted in a material adjustment to the income statement 

table of contents the corporation recognizes gains and losses at inception of a derivative contract only if the fair value of the contract is evidenced by a quoted market price in an active market  an observable price or other market transaction  or other observable data supporting a valuation model 
for those gains and losses not evidenced by the above mentioned market data  the transaction price is used as the fair value of the derivative contract 
any difference between the transaction price and the model fair value is considered an unrecognized gain or loss at inception of the contract 
previously unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in income using the straight line method of amortization over the contractual life of the derivative contract 
earlier recognition of the full unrecognized gain or loss is permitted if the trade is terminated early  subsequent market activity is observed which supports the model fair value of the contract  or significant inputs used in the valuation model become observable 
afs securities are recorded at fair value  which is generally based on direct market quotes from actively traded markets 
principal investing principal investing is included within equity investments and is discussed in more detail in business segment operations beginning on page principal investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies at all stages  from start up to buyout 
these investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund 
some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long term business models 
market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets 
investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value  however  the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotations 
at december   we had nonpublic investments of billion or approximately percent of the total portfolio 
valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment 
management determines values of the underlying investments based on multiple methodologies including in depth semi annual reviews of the investee s financial statements and financial condition  discounted cash flows  the prospects of the investee s industry and current overall market conditions for similar investments 
in addition  on a quarterly basis as events occur or information comes to the attention of management that indicates a change in the value of an investment is warranted  investments are adjusted from their original invested amount to estimated fair values at the balance sheet date with changes being recorded in equity investment gains in the consolidated statement of income 
investments are not adjusted above the original amount invested unless there is clear evidence of a fair value in excess of the original invested amount 
this evidence is often in the form of a recent transaction in the investment 
as part of the valuation process  senior management reviews the portfolio and determines when an impairment needs to be recorded 
the principal investing portfolio is not material to our consolidated balance sheet  but the impact of the valuation adjustments may be material to our operating results for any particular quarter 
accrued income taxes as more fully described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accrued income taxes  reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  can materially affect our operating results for any given quarter 
goodwill and other intangibles the nature of and accounting for goodwill and other intangibles is discussed in detail in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the reporting units utilized for this test were those that are one level below the business segments identified on page the impairment test is performed in two steps 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step must be performed 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  as defined in sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 

table of contents for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it 
an intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset  indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach and the fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach 
for purposes of the income approach  discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results  estimated future cash flows and an appropriate price to earnings multiple 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results 
however  these differences have not been material and we believe that this methodology provides a reasonable means to determine fair values 
cash flows were discounted using a discount rate based on expected equity return rates  which was percent for expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit 
for purposes of the market approach  valuations of reporting units were based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit 
our evaluations for the year ended december  indicated there was no impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
