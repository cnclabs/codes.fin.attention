table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and item a 
risk factors beginning on page for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent natural gas and oil producer concentrating on growing reserves and production through the exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves in north america 
we were founded in december as a delaware corporation and began exploring for natural gas and oil on behalf of keyspan corporation  our then parent company 
keyspan is a diversified energy provider whose principal natural gas distribution and electric generation operations are located in the northeastern united states 
in september  we completed our initial public offering and sold approximately of our shares to the public 
through three separate transactions  the first in february and last in november  keyspan completely divested its investment in the common stock of our company 
see note stockholders equity for a complete description of these three transactions 
at december   we had operations in five producing regions within the united states south texas  the arkoma basin of arkansas and oklahoma  east texas  the uinta and dj basins in the rocky mountains  and the gulf of mexico 
our total net proved reserves as of december  were billion cubic feet equivalent or bcfe  with onshore reserves totaling bcfe 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
approximately of our proved reserves at december   were classified as proved developed 
our daily production during averaged million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent or mmcfe and was significantly curtailed during the last four months of and into the first quarter of primarily as a result of infrastructure damage to third party pipelines and processing facilities caused by hurricanes katrina and rita that hit the louisiana and texas coasts in august and september we derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our natural gas and oil properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale 
the price of natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we have historically utilized derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas production 
during  and  the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods 
we operate as one segment as all of our assets are based in north american and each of our operating areas has similar economic characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
shift in operating focus and pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets in november  we announced our intent to explore the sale of our gulf of mexico assets and to shift our operating focus onshore 
at december   our offshore reserves totaled bcfe  or of our total proved reserves 
historically  production from our offshore properties has averaged to of total production 
our offshore properties are located in the shallow waters of the outer continental shelf 
key producing properties are located in the western and central gulf of mexico and include the mustang island  matagorda island  galveston island  high island  east cameron  west cameron  eugene island and main pass areas 
at december   we held interests in blocks in federal and state waters  of which were developed 
we had a total of producing platforms and production caissons  of which we operated during  offshore production averaged mmcfe day  and immediately prior to shut ins caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  averaged an estimated mmcfe day 
for december  offshore production averaged mmcfe per day with several fields still curtailed 
on february   we entered into an agreement to sell the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets to certain partnerships affiliated with merit energy company for million in cash  subject to adjustment and customary closing conditions 
the transaction is scheduled to close on or about march   with an effective date of january  we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets primarily to acquire longer lived natural gas assets onshore in north america and to repay existing debt 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to find suitable properties on attractive terms 
our operating revenues and cash flows are expected to decrease following the sale of these assets and are expected to remain at lower levels until we are able to replace the lost production with production from new properties 
where possible  we plan to structure our asset reinvestment to minimize taxes on any gain realized from the sale 
the sale process with respect to our remaining gulf of mexico assets is ongoing 
if a sale is not consummated  we expect to continue to operate and may consider other strategic alternatives with respect to these remaining offshore assets 
the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets accounted for approximately of our production and represented bcfe  or of our total proved reserves  at december  at december   we held interests in blocks in offshore texas state and federal waters  of which were developed 
our assets included producing platforms and production caissons 

table of contents the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets and any subsequent sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets will result in the reclassification of the fair value of the derivative obligations allocated to offshore production from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings 
at december   the fair value of derivative obligations allocated to offshore production for years  and was a liability of million million net of tax which approximates the amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the period 
the ultimate amount of this reclassification and possible charge against earnings will depend on the fair value of the obligations at the time that receipt of offshore production allocated to these hedges no longer appears probable 
this reclassification and possible charge to earnings will not affect cash flow 
in connection with the possible divestiture of our gulf of mexico assets  and after taking into account the impact of any such sale on our production levels and any acquisitions that appear imminent at the time of any such sale  we may and may be required under our revolving bank credit facility to liquidate a portion of our hedge position allocated to offshore production 
if we were to sell all of our gulf of mexico assets  we estimate that we would liquidate at least mmbtu per day of hedged production 
depending on prices in effect at the time of liquidation  we could be required to make a significant payment to unwind and settle the open contracts  which payment we would expect to finance with proceeds from the sale of any gulf of mexico assets and or borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
recent acquisition as part of the plan to shift our operational focus onshore  on november   we completed the acquisition of certain interests in natural gas and oil producing properties and undeveloped acreage in four fields located in south texas from kerr mcgee oil gas onshore lp and westport oil and gas company  lp the net purchase price of million was paid in cash and financed by borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
the properties cover approximately  net acres  include approximately wells and are located in the rincon field in starr county  the tijerina canales blucher field in jim wells and kleberg counties  the vaquillas ranch field in webb county  and the san carlos field in hidalgo county 
at december   the proved reserves attributed to these properties were approximately bcfe  of which approximately were natural gas 
current production from the four fields is estimated at approximately mmcfe day  net to the interests to be acquired 
we operate percent of the proved reserves with an average working interest of 
industry outlook we currently operate in north america and we believe this region is maturing and production growth is slowing or possibly declining 
while new discoveries are still being made in north america  the frequency and size of these discoveries is declining as finding and developing costs are increasing 
we believe domestic natural gas and oil production may be at or near its peak and can be expected to decline in the future  with the exception of relatively unexplored onshore regions such as the rocky mountains 
our future success in growing our reserve base at an acceptable finding cost will depend in large part on our ability to acquire new proved reserves and unevaluated acreage which we can explore and exploit 
we maintain an active acquisition program and expect to continue to devote significant resources to identifying and pursuing both tactical acquisitions that are designed to expand our operations within an existing core area as well as strategic acquisitions involving one or more new onshore regions 
we anticipate that the continued decline of the north american gas basins will lead to higher cost structures throughout our industry 
we believe that the cost of finding  developing and producing new natural gas and oil reserves through exploration and development operations will rise as the industry makes fewer discoveries and such discoveries generally 
table of contents will be of smaller average reserve size 
in addition  the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities in north america 
for full cost companies such as ours  increases in both acquisition and finding and development costs are expected to yield higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates and ultimately could increase the likelihood of a writedown in the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties if commodity prices fall substantially below current levels as we continue to add costs to our pool at higher rates with the addition of fewer new reserves to the amortization base 
in addition  we expect drilling costs and lease operating expenses to continue to increase as producers are required to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields 
natural gas is a commodity 
as such  the price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand 
demand for natural gas in the united states has increased dramatically over the last ten years  as many industrial users have gradually switched to a cleaner burning and historically cheaper fuel 
demand will be impacted by general economic conditions  estimates of gas in storage  weather and other seasonal conditions  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
market conditions involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
continued concerns over the united states ability to meet its longer term gas needs from declining domestic supply have resulted in sustained prices above throughout  and as a direct result of the strong commodity prices during the last three year period  we were able to generate substantial cash flows to fund our exploration and development program 
however  historically  commodity prices have been very volatile  and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
in fact  the nymex closing price for natural gas changed from per mmbtu for june to per mmbtu for october and again to per mmbtu for march as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and oil prices  and  therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our future revenues and cash flows 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 
our continued growth and profitability depends on the strength of natural gas prices and our ability to acquire  find and develop new reserves at economical costs 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on a regular basis and discuss the development and disclosure process with our audit committee 
see note summary of organization and significant accounting policies of item contained in this form k for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
proved reserves 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of natural gas and oil which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
in addition  as a result of volatility and changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period  causing estimates of proved reserves to change  as well as causing estimates of future net revenues to change 
for the years ended december  and  we revised our proved reserves downward from prior years reports by approximately bcfe and bcfe  respectively  due to proved undeveloped reserves that were determined to be depleted or otherwise not recoverable  or from production performance indicating less gas in place or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
unevaluated properties 
the balance of unevaluated properties is comprised of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage  wells and production facilities in progress  wells pending determination and related capitalized interest 
these costs are initially excluded from our amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined  or generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
we assess all items in our 
table of contents unevaluated property balance on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we believe that substantially all of the costs included in our unevaluated property balance will be evaluated in the next four years 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated future abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability based on third party quotes and current actual costs 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
derivative instruments 
historically  our derivative contracts have qualified for hedge accounting under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
fair value is accessed and measured and is estimated by obtaining independent market quotes from counterparties  as well as utilizing the black option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  a risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
in addition  forward price curves and estimates of future volatility factors are used to access and measure the ineffectiveness of our open contracts at the end of each period 
if open contracts cease to qualify for hedge accounting  the mark to market change in the fair value is recognized in the income statement 
loss of hedge accounting and cash flow designation will cause volatility in earnings 
the fair values we report in our financial statements change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
taxes 
we are subject to income taxes at the federal level and in the states where we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from these estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
stock compensation expense 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards on the grant date which requires judgment in estimating the expected life of the option and the expected volatility of our stock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and these differences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see new accounting pronouncements below 
in addition to the critical estimates discussed above  estimates are used in accounting and computing depreciation  depletion and amortization  the full cost ceiling  accruals of operating costs and production revenues 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments and the current accounting under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for us  sfas r is effective for our first fiscal year beginning after june   or january  on january   we adopted the fair value expense recognition provisions of sfas as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure using the prospective method as defined by the sfas as a result  we have recognized compensation expense for all stock options granted subsequent to january   with no expense recognized for grants made prior to with the adoption of sfas r  we will recognize compensation expense over the remaining service period for the unvested portion of all options granted during and all options granted prior to are fully vested 
we adopted sfas r on january   using the modified version of the prospective application 
we plan to continue using the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant 
based on current estimates  we expect to incur additional stock compensation expense for grants made prior to our initial adoption of sfas  and not vested as of january  of million million net of amounts capitalized during and million net of amounts capitalized during  with all prior awards being fully expensed by december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab providing additional guidance in applying the provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
sab should be applied when adopting sfas r and addresses a wide range of issues  focusing on valuation methodologies and the selection of assumptions 
in addition  sab addresses the interaction of sfas r with existing sec guidance 
overview of results our results for were significantly impacted by the physical damage to the gulf of mexico infrastructure and the resulting market uncertainties caused by hurricane katrina in august and hurricane rita in september 
rita s path cut directly through our gulf of mexico operations 
while our physical facilities incurred relatively minor damage  our production during the last four months of the year was significantly curtailed primarily as a result of damage to third party pipelines and processing facilities 
key projects scheduled to add significant new production during the third and fourth quarters of were further delayed 
curtailed supply throughout the gulf of mexico created unprecedented price movements in the natural gas markets 
nymex prices for natural gas reached record levels which resulted in record revenues that could not be realized in earnings because a significant percentage more than during the fourth quarter of as a result of offshore curtailments of our natural gas production was hedged well below these record prices 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the basis differential between nymex and the houston ship channel widened from an average of per mmbtu to an average of per mmbtu 
because approximately of our production is allocated to the houston ship channel index  we realized lower sales prices 
as commodity prices continued to increase from prior year levels  so did activity levels across the industry  creating an increase in the demand for materials  equipment  rigs and services 
as a result  we experienced a significant increase in our finding and development costs as well as our lease operating expenses during these factors  combined with an increase in debt were the primary drivers behind results of operations  net income and cash flows during during we incurred relatively minor structural damage from hurricanes katrina and rita and expect to spend a maximum of million for hurricane related repairs 
we anticipate these losses in excess of our deductible will be covered by insurance 
as we do not carry business interruption insurance  the delay of revenues resulting from curtailed and delayed production is not covered 
we estimate the curtailment of production and drilling delays resulting directly from the storms impacted operating revenues in by an estimated million 
revenues are expected to be further impacted during the first quarter of as we wait for repairs to third party pipelines and processing facilities  with restoration expected by the end of the first quarter of  we announced our intent to explore the sale of our gulf of mexico assets and to shift our operating focus onshore 
we plan to reinvest the net cash proceeds from the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets primarily into longer lived natural gas assets onshore in north america and to retire debt 
the pending sale of our offshore texas assets is expected to close on or about march   with an effective date of january  see consolidated financial statements  note subsequent events pending sale of texas gulf of mexico assets  we generated million in net income  a decrease of from million in  primarily as a result of lower revenues caused by production curtailments and million in net hedge losses combined with higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  general and administrative expense and interest expense  we produced bcfe and our average daily production rate was mmcfe per day compared to mcfe day during  a decrease of 
we estimate that approximately bcfe  or approximately mmcfe per day on an annualized basis  was deferred by hurricane related curtailments and delays  we increased total net proved reserves by to bcfe 
we added a net bcfe  which includes bcfe added through the drill bit and bcfe added through acquisitions after bcfe of downward revisions  due primarily to reservoir performance 
with the total net additions of bcfe  we replaced of the bcfe produced in  we generated million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to million during  a decrease of  we spent million for investments in natural gas and oil properties  an increase of over our expenditures included million for producing property acquisitions that compares to million spent towards acquisitions in  an increase of  we increased our outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility by a net million  in part to fund our acquisitions and in part to fund cash requirements for the settlement of derivative contracts  we drilled wells  of which  or  were successful with offshore  in east texas  in south texas  in arkoma and in the rockies  
table of contents we successfully integrated the gulf of mexico producing properties acquired in september and october from bp exploration production inc and orca energy  lp  respectively and successfully completed key development projects at main pass and eugene island  we drilled or participated in drilling of three offshore discoveries that were considered deep shelf prospects 
the successful wells were drilled at west cameron  west cameron and west cameron additional exploratory successes included galveston and east cameron  we expanded our onshore exploration efforts in the dj basin with one rig drilling throughout the year and brought on line our first group of wells during the third quarter of  we continued our exploration and exploitation efforts in the uinta basin with one rig drilling throughout the year and partnered with two separate groups to spread our risk and accelerate our efforts 
at year end  we had three rigs drilling on our acreage 
we had a discovery north of the natural buttes field and the well is producing approximately bbls per day  net to our interests  as of the date of this annual report  we extended our development efforts in the north roleta field  located in south texas  southwest of our operations in the charco field  where we began to assemble acreage and drilled a discovery well in we successfully drilled and completed eight of ten wells and added approximately mmcfe per day in production  net to our interests  we expanded our east texas acreage through a series of three related acquisitions totaling million and added an estimated bcfe in proved reserves 
we successfully integrated these producing properties  added two drilling rigs  successfully drilled development wells which added bcfe in reserves and increased average daily production in the area from mmcfe per day in january to mmcfe per day in december see note acquisitions and dispositions  we acquired producing properties and acreage in four south texas fields along the frio and vicksburg trends from kerr mcgee oil gas and westport at the end of november for a net million and added estimated proved reserves of bcfe and future exploitation opportunities 
we took over operations december  and began to integrate the properties and optimize production rates 
daily production is averaging to mmcfe per day as of the date of this annual report 
we expect to spud our first well in the rincon field in april  see note acquisitions and dispositions  our depletion rate for natural gas and oil properties increased from per mcfe during the fourth quarter of to per mmcfe during the fourth quarter of  primarily as a result of an industry wide increase in costs 
we spent more during on a per mcfe basis to find  develop or acquire new reserves and it is projected to cost more to develop our proved reserves as our future development costs increased by million or in from prior year end  we incurred million in additional general and administrative expenses as a result of special charges  including million incurred pursuant to the february renegotiation of employment agreements with five of our key executive officers  including our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and our then chief financial officer  million in outside professional fees attributable to the review of a corporate transaction in the second quarter and an acquisition in the third quarter  both of which were not consummated  and million in the fourth quarter related to severance and other separation related payments made to certain former employees  including our former chief financial officer  as a result of higher market prices for natural gas at december   the fair value of our open derivative contracts increased from a liability of million million net of tax at december   to a liability of million million net of tax at december  during  we incurred a total net loss on our hedging activities of million which compares to a total net loss of million during of our total net hedging loss  million was incurred during the fourth quarter  our board of directors approved a plan for discretionary stock repurchases from time to time up to million of our common stock in conjunction with the possible divesture of all of our gulf of mexico assets and subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and contractual restrictions  available cash  competing reinvestment opportunities in the acquisition market for oil and gas assets and other factors  and we renegotiated our revolving bank credit facility to increase our banks lending commitments from million to million 
borrowings under the facility are secured by our onshore natural gas and oil assets as well as certain other assets 
our initial borrowing base has been set at million  which is expected to decrease upon completion of the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets and likely would be reduced further upon any sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets

income from operations income from operations for  income from operations decreased by million  or  as compared to  as operating revenues decreased by million or and operating expenses increased by million or for the year 
natural gas revenues of million were significantly impacted by a million cash loss realized on derivative contracts settled during the period of which million was incurred during the fourth quarter 
although natural gas prices were consistently strong throughout the first eight months of  even exceeding levels seen in  the market volatility caused by hurricanes katrina and rita during the last four months of the year and the resulting record nymex prices for natural gas during this period compounded our hedge losses for the year 
income from operations production growth and higher realized natural gas prices were the primary factors contributing to our increase in operating income in over increased revenues were offset in part by a increase in operating expenses 
production volume vs 
production volumes were lower in compared to  due primarily to curtailments of offshore production and the natural production decline of our existing property base as we were delayed in bringing on line new production offshore and in the dj basin 
onshore 
daily production rates for were slightly higher than the prior year  averaging mmcfe per day compared to mmcfe per day during through development drilling we added approximately mmcfe per day in arkoma 
table of contents and mmcfe per day in east texas 
we continued our exploration efforts in the rockies  where we experienced delays in bringing production from the dj basin wells on line  but added approximately mmcfe per day in the region for the year

daily production rates decreased by  or mmcfe per day  from an average of mmcfe per day during to an average of mmcfe per day in for the first eight months of  offshore production rates were lower than prior year levels due in part to delays in our development program caused by delays in rig availability during the first half of and in part to i an unsuccessful side track at high island  ii lower production rates at high island subsequent to a side track completed in the second quarter  and iii declining production rates at high island a  galveston and east cameron  all key producing fields during at the end of august  pre storm production was estimated at mmcfe per day  primarily as a result of newly developed production at galveston  matagorda a  west cameron  main pass and mustang island we estimate that approximately bcfe or mcfe per day on an annualized basis was shut in and deferred during the last four months of as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
production volume vs 
the increase in production for is primarily a result of both production added from gulf of mexico properties acquired during the fourth quarter of  as well as newly developed production  both onshore and offshore  from our existing property base 
onshore 
daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe per day in to mmcfe per day in  despite our loss of approximately mmcfe per day as a result of the divesture of our south louisiana and appalachian basin properties during the first half of the arkoma basin was our onshore growth area during we experienced the full impact of the accelerated drilling program initiated in that continued throughout as we added mmcfe per day in newly developed production 
with three rigs drilling through the first months of  arkoma production reached a record of mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter compared to mmcfe per day during the fourth quarter of for  south texas production increased to an average of mmcfe per day compared to mmcfe per day average daily production rates for arkoma and south texas were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of by our operational curtailment 
as a result of rising rig rates and service costs during the quarter  we reduced our onshore rig activity to keep capital spending within budgeted levels 
in south texas  we went from six rigs to four and in arkoma we went from three rigs to one 
in addition  we deferred the completion of seven wells in south texas capable of producing an estimated mmcfe per day  net  and five wells in arkoma capable of producing an estimated mmcfe per day  net 
by the end of january  we had resumed our six rig program in south texas and added a second rig in arkoma 
in the rockies  was an exploratory year and our activities were aimed at expanding our acreage position and proving up reserves in several exploration projects on our uinta basin acreage acquired in we drilled a total of wells  in the uinta basin  four in the dj basin and one in montana 
of the total drilled  wells or were successful 
by december  six of our uinta basin wells were producing approximately mmcfe per day  net to our interest 
at december   production from the remaining of our successful uinta basin wells remained delayed  awaiting right of way approval for pipeline construction from the bureau of land management blm 
subsequent to december   we received approval from the blm for pipelines on of the wells

we experienced record production growth as average daily rates increased from mmcfe per day during to an average of mmcfe per day during we added approximately mmcfe per day in newly developed production  of which an average of mmcfe per day was attributable to development drilling at high island a and east cameron and during the year  we completed and brought on line seven development wells at high island a  two at ec and one at east cameron all of these fields were acquired in mid october  as part of our acquisition of gulf of mexico properties 
production from these properties accounted for approximately mmcfe per day of our offshore production during partially offsetting the production from our newly acquired properties were declines from existing and maturing fields totaling approximately mmcfe per day  resulting in a net mmcfe per day production increase year over year 
because the majority of our fields are located in the western and central gulf of mexico  hurricane ivan in september  had minimal impact on our results for the year 
we estimate that during the third quarter  approximately  mcfe or mmcfe per day was deferred 
all shut in production was fully restored prior to the end of the third quarter of

we expect to recapture the production shortfall during the first quarter of  at which time the million will be recognized as a reduction to earnings  unrealized loss of million million net of tax for the ineffective portion of open contracts at the end of the period that were not eligible for deferral under sfas due primarily to the basis differentials between the contract price  which is nymex based  and the indexed price at the point of sale  of which is allocated to the houston ship channel index  and unrealized gain of million million net of tax due to the loss of correlation during the fourth quarter of of the houston ship channel index and the nymex price

liquidity capital requirements our principal requirements for capital are to fund our exploration  development and acquisition activities and to satisfy our contractual obligations  primarily the repayment of debt and any amounts owing during the period relating to our hedging positions 
our uses of capital include the following drilling and completing new natural gas and oil wells  constructing and installing new production infrastructure  acquiring additional reserves and producing properties  acquiring and maintaining our lease acreage position and our seismic resources  maintaining  repairing  and enhancing existing natural gas and oil wells  plugging and abandoning depleted or uneconomic wells  and indirect costs related to our exploration activities  including payroll and other expense attributable to our exploration professional staff 
in light of the ongoing process to sell our gulf of mexico assets  we are currently reviewing our capital program for to maintain flexibility of our capital program  we typically do not enter into material long term obligations with any of our drilling contractors or service providers with respect to our operated properties  however  we may choose to do so if an opportunity is economically beneficial 
we do not include property acquisition costs in our initial capital budget because the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions are inherently unpredictable 
as the year progresses  we will continue to evaluate our capital spending 
actual levels may vary due to a variety of factors  including the timing of any sale of our gulf of mexico assets  drilling results  natural gas prices  economic conditions and future acquisitions 
future commitments the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  all amounts listed in the table below are categorized as liabilities on our balance sheet with the exception of lease payments for operating leases and outstanding letters of credit issued for performance obligations

the table includes references to our financial statements for information regarding the listed obligation 
contractual obligations relating to our revolving bank credit facility and our senior notes include only payments of principal 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december   reflects accrued interest payable on our revolving bank credit facility of approximately million which is payable over the next day period

in connection with the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets and any subsequent sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets  we may and may be required under our revolving bank credit facility to liquidate hedge positions allocated to offshore production 
depending on prices in effect at the time of liquidation  we could be required to make a significant payment to unwind and settle these contracts

we expect to use the proceeds from any sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets for one or more of the following purposes acquiring additional onshore assets  repaying indebtedness or repurchasing shares of our common stock 
at december   we had million of excess borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility 
we expect our borrowing base to decrease upon completion of the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets  and to decrease further upon any sale of our remaining gulf of mexico assets 
if a significant acquisition opportunity arises  we may also access public markets to issue additional debt and or equity securities 
our primary sources of cash during were from funds generated from operations and bank borrowings 
cash was used primarily to fund acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures and settlements required on derivative contracts 
during  we made aggregate cash payments of million and million  respectively  for interest and taxes 
the table below summarizes the sources of cash during and years ended december  variance change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash at december   we had a working capital deficit of million and long term debt of million 
the working capital deficit at december  was due to a current liability of million representing the fair value of 
table of contents our derivative instruments estimated to be payable over the next months  offset in part by the associated deferred tax asset of million 
as a result of the sustained high level of natural gas prices  the fair value of our open derivative contracts payable within the next months increased by million from a liability of million at december   to a liability of million at december  corresponding to the increase in the liability  the associated deferred tax asset increased by million during this same twelve month period of the fair value of our derivative instruments will fluctuate with commodity prices  and as commodity prices increase  our liquidity exposure tends to increase as a result of open derivative instruments 
consequently  we are more likely to have the largest unfavorable mark to market position in a high commodity price environment 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of cash receipts and disbursements for operating activities and borrowings or repayments under our revolving bank credit facility 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital  which we believe is typical of companies of our size in the exploration and production industry 
however  the sharp rise in prices at the end of september triggered in part by hurricanes katrina and rita  resulted in a larger negative fair value than we consider normal 
prices have declined considerably and closed at per mmbtu for march down from the to per mmbtu range during the fourth quarter of in addition  we may liquidate a portion of our offshore hedge position in connection with the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets and or following any subsequent sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets 
at december   the fair value of derivative obligations allocated to offshore production for years  and was a liability of million million net of tax which approximates the amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the period 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million or during the decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in operating income during in addition to fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities that are caused by timing of cash receipts and disbursements  commodity prices  production volume and operating expenses are the key factors driving changes in operating cash flows 
for  we experienced lower production volumes together with higher operating expenses 
investing activities 
total company capital expenditures during were million which included million in drilling costs accrued and unpaid at december  during  we spent million or more than we spent during during  we invested million in natural gas and oil properties  which included million for the acquisition of producing properties and  we spent million for non oil and gas property and equipment

table of contents financing activities 
during  total long term debt increased by a net million  as we borrowed under our revolving bank credit facility in part to fund acquisitions totaling million and in part to fund cash requirements for the settlement of derivative contracts 
access to capital markets 
we have the capacity to offer up to million of our common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and debt securities  or a combination of any of these securities  under effective shelf registration statements filed with the sec in march and october we believe that operating cash flow and our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements during we continuously monitor our working capital and debt position as well as coordinate our capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
in november  we increased the lending commitment under our revolving bank credit facility from million to million with an additional million available upon request and with prior approval from our lenders 
amounts available for borrowing under the credit facility are limited to a borrowing base  which as of december  was million 
the borrowing base of million is expected to remain in effect until the next scheduled redetermination on april  however  we expect our borrowing base to be reduced upon consummation of the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets and likely would be further reduced upon any sale of the remaining portion of our gulf of mexico assets 
in addition to operating cash flow and borrowings under the revolving credit facility  we believe we could finance capital expenditures with issuances of additional equity or debt securities or development with industry partners 
we plan to reinvest the net cash proceeds from the pending sale of the texas portion of our gulf of mexico assets into longer lived natural gas and oil assets onshore in north america 
our plans include structuring the reinvestment  where possible  to optimize the tax effects under the tax free exchange rules of section of the internal revenue code 
however  numerous market conditions and uncertainties may not allow for the reinvestment of all of the proceeds within the prescribed time period for the most effective tax treatment 
to the extent we are not able to reinvest any such proceeds  we would then expect to repay debt 
stock repurchase program 
in november  our board of directors approved a plan for discretionary repurchases from time to time of up to million in company stock in conjunction with the possible divesture of all of our gulf of mexico assets 
these purchases may be in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  and will be subject to a number of considerations  including market conditions for our shares  applicable legal requirements and contractual restrictions  available cash  competing reinvestment opportunities in the acquisition market for oil and gas assets and other factors 
no repurchases have been made as of the date of this annual report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
our sales price is primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for our natural gas and oil production have been volatile and unpredictable 
interest rate market risk at december   our total debt was million  of which approximately or million is fixed at an interest rate of 
the remaining of our total debt balance at december   or million  represents our bank debt that is tied to floating or market interest rates  prime rate or libor at our election 
fluctuations in floating interest rates will cause our annual interest costs relating to our bank debt to fluctuate 
during the fourth quarter of  the interest rate on our outstanding bank debt averaged 
if the balance of our bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a change in market interest rates would impact our cash flow by an estimated  per quarter 

table of contents commodity risk we utilize derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of our natural gas and oil production to achieve more predictable cash flows  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations of natural gas 
our derivatives are not held for trading purposes and our hedging policy prescribes that at the time we enter into a contract that all hedge structures meet the requirements for hedging accounting under sfas and that each transaction is specifically identified as a hedge for federal income tax purposes as defined in section b of the internal revenue code 
while the use of certain hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements  as has been the case in recent years  especially during the last four months of the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that we typically use are swaps  collars and options  which we generally place with major investment grade financial institutions that we believe are minimal credit risks 
we believe that our credit risk related to our natural gas hedging instruments is no greater than the risk associated with the primary contracts and that the elimination of price risk reduces volatility in our reported results of operations  financial position and cash flows from period to period and lowers our overall business risk  however  as a result of our hedging activities  we may be exposed to greater credit risk in the future 
generally  our hedges qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and  accordingly  we carry the fair market value of our derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and defer unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement as a component of natural gas and oil revenues in the period the hedged production occurs 
if any ineffectiveness occurs  amounts are recorded directly to natural gas and oil revenues and would be included as a component of the line item natural gas and oil revenues 
for us  ineffectiveness is primarily a result of changes at the end of each period in the price differentials between the price of the derivative contract  which uses a nymex price  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged  of which approximately is the houston ship channel index 
if our hedges cease to qualify for hedge accounting as a result of ineffectiveness  as was the case during the fourth quarter of as a result of a loss of market correlation between the nymex price and the houston ship channel index  we include the mark to market change in the fair value of open contracts in income 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments the following table summarizes the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments for each of the twelve month periods from january to december  and and provides the fair value at the end of each period year ended december  change in fair value of derivatives instruments before tax in thousands fair value of contracts at january realized loss on contracts settled fair value of new contracts when entered into decrease in fair value of all open contracts net decrease increase during period fair value of contracts outstanding at december
