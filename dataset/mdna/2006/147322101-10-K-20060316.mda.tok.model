in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a  part i  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
we do not guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
overview we design  develop and manufacture advanced wafer probing solutions for the electrical measurement of high performance chips 
we design  manufacture and assemble our products in beaverton  oregon  with global sales  service and support centers in north america  europe  japan and singapore 
we were incorporated and introduced our first commercial products in our products include engineering probe stations  analytical probes  production probe cards  application software and services 
engineering probe stations address the need for precise and accurate measurement of semiconductor electrical characteristics during chip design or when optimizing the chip fabrication process 
our engineering probe stations are highly configurable and are typically sold with various accessories  including our analytical probes and application software  as well as accessories from third parties 
in addition  we design and build custom engineering probe stations to address the specific requirements of our customers 
analytical probes are sold to serve as components of our engineering probe stations  or less often  to serve as components of test equipment manufactured by third parties 
our production probe cards are designed and sold for production test applications  ranging from very low current parametric testing to sophisticated  high speed radio frequency testing 
we refer to analytical probes and production probe cards as consumables  as they are routinely replaced during the testing process 
we also generate revenue through the sale of service contracts to our customers 
to date  we have derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of our engineering probe stations  and we expect to continue to do so for the next few years 
our production probe card revenue  however  has increased as a percentage of total revenues in and we expect that trend to continue in our engineering probe stations  analytical probes  probing accessories and application software are sold through our engineering products division 
our production probe cards are sold through our pyramid probe division 
as of january  we collect only revenue information for each division because we believe that the segment data previously collected was not useful for understanding our business and was not useful information on which to base operating decisions 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of  the segment reporting financial statement footnote only presents revenue data for each segment 
our engineering products business and operating results depend in significant part on the level of capital expenditures related to semiconductor research and development  which  in turn  depends upon current and anticipated market demand for chips 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of over supply  which has often resulted in a reduction in demand for our products 
while our financial results are impacted by cycles within the semiconductor industry  we believe our business cycles are typically less pronounced than those of other semiconductor equipment companies 
we believe this is due to our greater reliance on our customers research and development capital spending and usage of test consumables rather than on our customers spending to increase production capacity 
capital spending aimed at increasing production capacity is one of the first areas in which most semiconductor manufacturers reduce spending in an industry downturn 
while the conversion to mm technology continues  high conversion costs combined with continued process developments on mm wafers continue to make sales of our sub mm probing systems an important component of our revenue stream for the foreseeable future 
mm technology more than doubles the available area on a wafer  significantly increasing the number of chips per wafer and reducing per unit manufacturing costs 
revenue from our mm engineering probe stations  including all probes  accessories and other items sold therewith  represented  and of our total engineering products division revenue in  and  respectively 
we sell our products both directly through our own sales force and indirectly through a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors 
in north america and asia  excluding japan  singapore and malaysia  we sell most of our products through manufacturers representatives 
we sell certain products in these regions directly 
in japan  singapore and malaysia  we sell through cascade microtech japan  kk and cascade microtech singapore  our direct sales and service subsidiary and branch office  respectively 
in europe  we sell primarily through distributors and manufacturers representatives  except in the uk  where we sell through our direct sales subsidiary  cascade microtech europe  ltd 
we also sell certain products directly in germany  austria and switzerland 
in the rest of the world  we typically sell through manufacturers representatives or distributors 
we are currently in the process of establishing a distribution sales office in china and a direct sales office in taiwan 
our distributors normally place orders with us once they have received an order from an end user customer  and  therefore  the total amount of inventory held by our distributors at any given date is not material 
in the past  our business has experienced seasonality 
typically  our revenue has been lower in our fiscal first quarter than in our fiscal fourth quarter preceding it 
however  revenue in the first quarter of was greater than the revenue in the fourth quarter of as strength in the asian market outweighed the seasonality factors 
also  we expect our revenue in the first quarter of to be greater than our revenue in the fourth quarter of due to delays in closing certain orders in the fourth quarter of in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
we sell our solutions to most segments of the semiconductor industry  including manufacturers of communications  wireless  microprocessors and other logic and memory chips 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from sales of our engineering probe stations and analytical probes to research and development laboratories of semiconductor manufacturers as well as to fabless semiconductor companies and academic institutions 
as a result  we sell to a geographically diversified customer base  with more than of our revenue in  and generated outside of north america  primarily in japan  other asian countries and  to a lesser extent  europe 
cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test and installation labor and overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  primarily result from changes in geographic mix  product mix  general pricing dynamics and yields in some of our production lines 
sales in europe typically have a lower margin than sales in north america and japan due to our use of third party distributors in europe 
we typically achieve higher margins on our consumables than on our engineering probe stations 
gross margin will also vary depending on our revenue levels  the level of overhead absorption  and  to a lesser extent  the success of our ongoing productivity improvements and component prices 
in addition  as we add production related personnel and equipment and third party costs to improve lead times  this will cause gross margins to decline if this does not result in additional revenue in the same quarter 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements that provide for the reimbursement of research and development expenses 
such reimbursements are netted against gross research and development expenses 
in addition  our research and development expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the usage level of our production probe fab for research and development activity 
research and development expenses do not include costs to obtain patents or defend our intellectual property rights  consisting of patents and trademarks  or amortization of capitalized patents and trademarks 
such expenses are included with selling  general and administrative 
research and development expenses also do not include expenses for design work on custom orders that do not result in reusable technology 
such expenses are included as a component of cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  manufacturers representative commissions  patent and trademark amortization and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company 
stock based compensation includes the amortization of value attributed to stock options granted during the one year period prior to filing our registration statement for our initial public offering in  as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to option grants at the time we filed a registration statement for our planned initial public offering in the stock options granted during these periods were granted at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant  as determined by our board of directors  and are accounted for using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
given the lack of an active public market for our outstanding common stock at the time  our board of directors established estimates of fair value for our common stock  as well as for options to purchase our common stock  based on factors such as recent negotiated transactions  our financial condition and recent operating results  our competitive position and future prospects and analysis of financial data of comparable public companies 
although we believed that the exercise price of the options granted prior to our initial public offering reflected the fair market value of our common stock on each grant date  in anticipation of our initial public offering in  we re evaluated the fair market value of our common stock for the three year period immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement 
based on such re evaluation we determined that the fair market value of our common stock during the one year period prior to the filing of the registration statement exceeded the exercise price of options granted during such period 
we therefore recorded deferred compensation totaling the amount by which the re assessed fair market value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of the options granted during the period 
the balance of the deferred stock based compensation was  as of december  other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on sales of investments and transaction and remeasurement related foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense can also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 
transaction related foreign currency gains and losses result from gains and losses recognized on foreign exchange forward contracts and on certain of our accounts receivable that are denominated in japanese yen 
remeasurement related foreign currency gains result from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated accounting records into us dollars 
accretion of redeemable stock and loss on redemption includes the accretion of certain costs related to the issuance of our series c convertible preferred stock and the cost of redeeming certain shares of our common stock 
in december  we redeemed our series c convertible preferred stock for cash and a three year note and  accordingly  we recognized the remaining unaccreted costs of  as a loss upon the redemption

revenue revenue increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in revenue in the engineering products division increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in engineering products revenue in compared to was primarily due to a increase in unit sales of our engineering probe stations in compared to the increase related to improved unit sales was partially offset by an overall decrease in average order total of in compared to average order total includes the sales price of all analytical probes  probe cards and other accessories purchased with an engineering probe station 
the decrease in the overall average order total included decreases for both mm and non mm stations in compared to the mm station average order total decreased in compared to  while the non mm station average order total decreased in the same time period 
the decrease in average order total for our mm stations was primarily due to a high average order total comparison from the second half of due to the sale of units with additional accessories in that period 
the decrease in the non mm station average order total was due primarily to the sale of a new  lower cost version of one of our preexisting mm stations 
while we currently sell a larger number of non mm engineering probe stations than mm engineering probe stations  we expect the trend of increased unit sales of mm probe stations to continue into as the industry continues to shift to mm fabrication facilities and as chip structures continually become increasingly complex 
the increase in revenue in the engineering products division in compared to was primarily due to an increase in the average order total  as well an overall increase in unit volume 
average order total in the engineering products division increased in compared to  primarily due to a increase in the unit volume of sales of our mm engineering probe stations  which have a higher average selling price than our mm engineering probe stations 
offsetting the increase in mm unit volume  was a decrease in unit volume sales of our mm engineering probe stations in compared to  for an overall increase in total unit volume sales of 
the increase in average order total was also attributable to an increase in sales of accessories and options ordered by customers with their engineering probe stations in compared to revenue in the pyramid probe division increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increases in revenue in the pyramid probe division in compared to and in compared to were due to increases in the number of production probe cards sold 
while our pyramid probes still represent a small portion of our customers total probe card purchases  many of our large customers are now ordering our pyramid probes for numerous  mainstream  high volume logic test applications  displacing their historical purchases of cantilever and vertical probe cards 
we continue to have a significant share of the market in probe cards for wireless devices 
we also expect to continue to increase our non wireless production probe card applications for a variety of wirebonded chip types 
we have been adding probe card capabilities in the form of headcount and equipment over the past several quarters 
however  the strong demand has caused our lead times to increase 
we expect to continue to add headcount and equipment in the coming quarters in order to shorten the lead times 
when fully utilized  the capacity of our probe card microfabrication facility is about million annually with our current product mix 
we are currently using less than one third of the facility s capacity 
our growth rate  therefore  relies on our ability to recruit and train enough top quality people for product fulfillment and field support 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above  partially offset by an improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenue discussed below 
the increase in cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the increase in unit volume sales of our engineering probe stations discussed above  partially offset by production improvements made during primarily related to our probe station product platforms 
gross profit our gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in our gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to the increased demand and production volumes of our products  as well as an improved product mix for a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue in compared to in  the product mix included more pyramid probe revenue  and  since the fixed costs of the pyramid microfabrication facility are relatively high  this revenue increase resulted in margin leverage for those products 
the increase in our gross profit in compared to was primarily due to production improvements  efficiencies gained as production volumes increased  approximately  of savings due to improved component pricing with certain vendors  a  decrease in inventory write downs and a  decrease in warranty expense 
the decrease in inventory write downs was due to  of write downs in related to the poor adoption of one of our product lines that was discontinued compared to only  of such write downs in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in compared to in and in the increase in our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in compared to was primarily due to absorption of fixed costs as sales volumes increased  particularly in the pyramid microfabrication facility  partially offset by a shift in mix to more non mm systems as compared to mm systems in compared to we achieve lower gross profit as a percentage of revenue on our non mm systems than we do on our mm systems 
the increase in our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in compared to was due to production improvements  efficiencies gained as a result of an increase in production volumes  improved component pricing and decreases in inventory write downs 
research and development research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased  or  in compared to million in the increase in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily due to a  increase in contractor fees for new product development efforts  a  increase in employee wages and related costs due to headcount increases and salary adjustments in the latter half of and a  increase in project supplies 
the increase in research and development expenses in compared to was due primarily to only  of reimbursement of our research and development expenses on a joint project in compared to  of such reimbursements in the remainder of the increase resulted from contract labor related to development of reusable technology from customer specific orders 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in sg a in compared to was primarily due to an increase in representative commissions  due to both the increase in revenues as well as an increase in the commission rate in compared to  an increase in employee wages and related costs due to headcount increases and salary adjustments in the latter half of and  an increase in media advertising  an increase in legal and patent costs and an increase in other costs related to being a public company  including director and officer insurance  accounting fees and sarbanes oxley act compliance consultants as detailed below amount of increase due to representative commissions employee wages and related costs media advertising legal and patent costs public company costs this increase in was partially offset by  of severance in  which was not repeated in the increase in sg a in compared to was primarily due to  of severance related to the termination of our former chief financial officer in the second quarter of compared to  of severance in representative commissions and employee commissions increased  which was in line with the revenue increase of 
employee compensation and related benefits increased  in compared to  resulting from salary increases and headcount increases 
unfavorable changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen in compared to contributed  to the increase in stock based compensation total stock based compensation was  in compared to  in and  in the decrease in compared to was due to our accelerated amortization method  wherein more expense is amortized in the early periods 
in addition  the reversal of  of stock based compensation in  which included a reversal of  related to the termination of our former chief financial officer in the second quarter of  lowered our future amortization 
in addition to normal amortization  stock based compensation in included  due to accelerated vesting of stock options related to the termination of our former chief financial officer and is net of reversals for employee terminations of  and  in and  respectively 
stock based compensation in included the amortization of value attributed to stock options issued in the one year period prior to filing the registration statement related to our initial public offering  whereas deferred stock compensation in included amortization of deferred costs related to the grant of stock options at the time we filed a registration statement for our planned initial public offering in other income expense interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities and totaled million   and  respectively  in  and the increase in compared to was primarily due to the increase in our invested balances as a result of proceeds received from our initial public offering in december the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates in compared to and lower invested cash balances due to the payment of million in the fourth quarter of for the conversion of our series c preferred stock and the repayment of million of a note payable in interest expense was  in  of which  was related to interest on our million note payable for the portion of the day prepayment notice period that occurred in january we gave notice of prepayment and prepaid the remainder of our million note payable and related interest in late december interest expense of  in represented interest on the million note payable  which resulted from the conversion of our series c preferred stock in the fourth quarter of other  net totaled  in compared to  in and  in other  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  foreign currency remeasurement gain loss foreign currency transaction gain settlement income from a service provider other the settlement income from a service provider was fully recognized in the second quarter of and we do not anticipate any additional settlement income in future periods 
income taxes our provision for income taxes totaled million  or  of income before income taxes  in compared to million  or of income before income taxes  in and  or  of loss before income taxes in our tax rate differed from federal statutory tax rates primarily due to higher non taxable income for both federal and state income tax purposes  utilization of tax credits and the release of prior year valuation allowances since management believes the benefit of these credits is more likely than not to be utilized in future years 
deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet realized for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in  we released  of valuation allowance related to the future realization of foreign tax credits and foreign net operating losses 
we now believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these credits and losses will be realized in future periods based on anticipated future profits 
the valuation allowance was million as of both december  and our tax provision included the reversal of  of previously recorded valuation allowance based on our performance 
the reversal primarily related to us research and engineering credits and state net operating loss carryforwards  which were utilized during in addition  in  we increased the valuation allowance by  for excess foreign tax credits and state of oregon research and engineering credits  which we believe are more likely than not to not be utilized in the future 
the net result was an increase in valuation allowance in of  tax expense  net of associated tax credits for taxes paid in japan  of  was recognized on the declaration of a million dividend from our japanese subsidiary and is reflected in the tax provision for we have not provided for united states income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered permanently invested outside of the united states 
upon repatriation  some of these earnings would generate foreign tax credits which may reduce the united states tax liability associated with any future foreign dividend 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to timing differences in the recognition of certain reserves and accruals 
accretion of redeemable stock accretion of redeemable stock totaled  in compared to  in upon completion of our initial public offering in december  all outstanding redeemable stock converted to common stock and  therefore  we did not have any accretion of redeemable stock in the decrease in accretion of redeemable stock in compared to was due to the conversion of our series c convertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the amount only included accretion of the redeemable common stock  whereas the amount included accretion of both the redeemable common and preferred stock 
in addition  the amount included the remaining  of unaccreted costs related to the series c convertible preferred stock as a loss on redemption  which occurred in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash and short term marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as well as from cash expected to be generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of net income of million and non cash expenses of million  offset by net changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
these changes are described below 
accounts receivable  net increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to increased sales  as well as a larger dollar amount of sales in the last month of the fourth quarter of compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of our days sales outstanding was approximately days at december  compared to days at december  inventories increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to an increase in our demonstration inventory as we sold off some of our demonstration inventory in the fourth quarter of and replaced it in this increase was partially offset by decreases in our work in process and finished goods inventories 
we believe that our inventory levels at december  are adequate given our revenue projections for the first quarter of prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to increases in investment interest receivable and the value of foreign exchange contracts related to japanese yen receivables 
accrued liabilities increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to increased employees stock purchase withholdings 
net cash used in investing activities of million in resulted from million used for the net purchase of marketable securities  million used for the purchase of fixed assets and million used for investment in patents and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in resulted from million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  partially being offset by  of additional costs related to our december initial public offering and  used for payments on capital lease obligations 
at december   we had an unused  standby letter of credit to be utilized in the event a customer requires certain guarantees 
this letter of credit is collateralized by  of our cash and cash equivalents and expires august  contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond capital leases operating leases purchase order commitments purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers that do not have acceptance criteria  including product sales to distributors  is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the product is shipped  title has transferred  no obligations remain and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products fob shipping point 
for any shipments with fob destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have acceptance criteria beyond our standard terms and conditions is deferred until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  and for systems shipped to integrators is also deferred 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
deferred revenue for systems shipped to integrators is recognized upon shipment to the final customer 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components product shipments  accessories  installation services and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component when sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in credit quality 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at december  and and our bad debt expense totaled   and  respectively  in  and valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost computed on a first in  first out basis  or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory write downs are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales 
total write downs to inventory were   and  respectively  in  and the write downs include   and  respectively  related to inventory write downs due to poor adoption of one of our product lines  which was discontinued 
the inventory related to the discontinued product line was either transferred to service inventory  discarded or donated to universities or other organizations 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we have not recorded any impairment charges for long lived assets during the years ended  or warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also netted against the warranty expense 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the products are sold without a right of return or price protection rights 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we anticipate our future warranty reserve accrual rate to be approximately of revenue 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
our warranty reserve totaled  and  respectively  at december  and these amounts are estimates of warranty costs for our installed base during the month period 
warranty expense totaled   and  respectively  during  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences to the extent management believes these assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management can not reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
during and  we reversed  and  respectively  of a previously recorded valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our and performance 
the reversal in related primarily to foreign tax credits and foreign net operating losses 
the reversal in primarily related to research and engineering credits and state net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized based on income 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets totaling  as a result of management s conclusion that certain of our foreign tax credits and state research and development credits may expire before we are able to recognize them 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to timing differences in the recognition of certain reserves and accruals  as well as state research tax credits which can be carried forward 
we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of these assets will be realized 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts 
the purpose of these activities is to reduce the risk that future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  to hedge specific receivables and bookings positions 
as of december   we had contracts outstanding for the purchase of japanese yen totaling approximately million  which mature through march historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
because we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   we would not experience a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows as the result of a one percent increase in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percent would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income related to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately  assuming our december  balances remained constant 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted of municipal and corporate notes 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our long term investments  as funds are re invested at current market interest rates
