item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare staffing services in the united states 
our healthcare staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing  allied health staffing  as well as clinical research trials staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of this business segment s revenue 
other staffing services include the placement of allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists  and the placement of clinical research professionals 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue was million  income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  and net i ncome was million  or per diluted share 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and we reduced our total debt to million at year end  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of as of december  in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by monitoring several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes  price  and contribution income see segment data 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
our healthcare staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of and demand for nurses at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare personnel could limit our ability to fill open assignments and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
we operate differentiated nurse recruiting brands consisting of cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations  competitive compensation and benefit packages  as well as high levels of customer service 
currently  the market for our healthcare staffing services reflects a substantially higher level of demand  as measured by the average monthly number of open orders from our hospital clients  compared to a year ago 
we believe this is due to improved labor dynamics that have created increased nurse turnover at hospitals  which has led to a greater supply of rns seeking travel assignments with us and to modest price increases for our nurse staffing services 
despite this more favorable environment for our core nurse staffing business  hospital in patient admissions trends remain relatively flat with low near term expectations for growth 
typically  as admissions increase  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
we believe many of the characteristics of a transition from a demand constrained enviro nment toward a more favorable supply constrained environment were present during  particularly the more favorable pricing environment 
from approximately mid through  we believe several factors combined to reduce demand for outsourced nurse staffing services 
these factors included a business cycle where hospitals were more focused on increasing staff nurse productivity and reducing their utilization of outsourced nurse staffing  the effects of a soft national job market that resulted in more full time and part time rns working more shifts directly for hospital employers at prevailing wages  as well as pushing nurses not working in the healthcare workforce back into hospitals  relatively low hospital admissions growth  and a corresponding reduction in rns seeking travel assignments due to a decline in the amount and diversity of staffing opportunities 
this decline followed a five year period from through where outsourced labor used by hospitals had increased 
during periods of decreased demand  we tend to experience more competitive pricing pressure 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the us as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
as a part of its business strategy  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients and group purchasing organizations 
cross country staffing provides clients with a suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall operating costs 
these range from efficiency enhancing technology to full vendor management solutions 
history in july  an affiliate of charterhouse group international  inc and certain members of management acquired the assets of cross country staffing  our predecessor  from w 
r 
grace co 
upon the closing of this transaction  we changed from a partnership to a c corporation form of ownership 
in december  we acquired travcorps corporation travcorps  which was owned by investment funds managed by morgan stanley private equity and certain members of travcorps management and subsequently changed our name to cross country travcorps  inc subsequent acquisitions and dispositions were made as discussed below 
in may  we changed our name to cross country  inc subsequently  in may  we changed our name to cross country healthcare  inc revenue our travel and per diem nurse staffing revenue is received primarily from acute care hospitals 
our clinical trials staffing revenue is received primarily from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  medical device companies as well as contract research organizations 
revenue from allied health staffing services is received from numerous sources  including providers of radiation  rehabilitation and respiratory services at hospitals  nursing homes  sports medicine clinics and schools 
revenue from our retained search and our education and training services is received from numerous sources  including hospitals  physician group practices  insurance companies and individual healthcare professionals 
our fees are paid directly by our clients rather than by third party payors 
revenue is recognized when services are rendered 
accordingly  accounts receivable includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet invoiced 
similarly  accrued compensation includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet paid 
each of our field employees on travel assignment works for us under a contract 
these contracts typically last weeks 
payroll contract employees are hourly employees whose contract specifies the hourly rate they will be paid  and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the contract period 
for payroll contract employees  we bill clients at an hourly rate and assume all employer costs  including payroll  withholding taxes  benefits  professional liability insurance and occupational safety and health administration  or osha  requirements  as well as any travel and housing arrangements 
mobile contract employees are hourly employees of the hospital client and receive an agreement that specifi es the hourly rates they will be paid by the hospital employer  as well as any benefits they are entitled to receive from us 
we recruit mobile contract employees for our hospital clients and provide those employees with company leased apartments and travel related support 
we are compensated for the services we provide at a predetermined rate negotiated with our hospital clients 
approximately of our field personnel are directly employed by us 
our fees are paid directly by our clients and  in certain cases  by third party administrative payors 
as a result  we have no direct exposure to medicare or medicaid reimbursements 
we have also entered into certain contracts with acute care facilities to provide comprehensive vendor management services 
under these contract arrangements  we use our nurses primarily along with those of third party subcontractors to fulfill customer orders 
if a subcontractor is used  revenue is recorded at the time of billing  net of any related subcontractor liability 
the resulting net revenue represents the administrative fee charged by us for our vendor management services 
acquisitions on june   we acquired the assets of med staff  inc medstaff for million in cash  net of a post closing working capital adjustment  plus an earnout provision up to a maximum of million based on performance 
medstaff did not qualify to receive any earnout payments 
medstaff is headquartered in newtown square  pennsylvania  and provides travel nurse staffing services and per diem staffing of healthcare professionals to clients across the united states

other identifiable intangible assets were valued at million  of which million was assigned to hospital relations and million was assigned to non compete agreements  based on a third party appraisal 
these identifiable intangible assets have been assigned useful lives with a weighted average range of years 
approximately million has been recorded to goodwill as the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
additional direct acquisition costs of million are included as goodwill 
goodwill is expected to be deductible only for tax purposes over a year life 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million term loan with staggered maturities through june  and a five year million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from the term loan  along with cash on hand of million  were used to finance the purchase of medstaff  to repay the term loan balance on the prior credit facility  and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the financing 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a new credit agreement that replaced this facility

discontinued operations discontinued operations during the years ended december    and include results from operations of the healthcare consulting business that was previously classified in our other human capital management services business segment 
on october   cross country healthcare sold assets of its jennings ryan kolb jrk and gill balsano consulting gbc practices to mitretek systems  inc mitretek for million in cash plus a working capital adjustment 
the carrying amount of net assets sold was million and consisted primarily of goodwill and other intangibles with a carrying amount of million 
we recognized a pre tax gain on this transaction of million million after taxes which is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  net proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down million of ter m loan debt 
the remaining consulting practice was held for sale until the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we conducted an assessment of the tangible and intangible net assets of the remaining consulting practice in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this assessment  we determined that the carrying amount of the net assets as then reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet exceeded its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the assessment  the company recorded a pretax charge of million to discontinued operations 
the charge represented the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million and a reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of million 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the remaining consulting practice and shut down the residual operations 
we continue to account for the consulting practice as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we estimated the remaining costs associated with the shut down of the business and recorded these costs in loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of these costs were allocated to the impairment valuation previously recorded in the fourth quarter of in accordance with fasb statement no 
 any adjustments to these estimated amounts will be recorded to discontinued operation in subsequent periods 
we do not expect final adjustments to be material and we expect all adjustments to be complete by the first quarter of we do not anticipate any further involveme nt in the consulting business going forward 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   include results from operations of our e staff business previously included in our other human capital management services segment 
e staff was an application service provider that had developed an internet subscription based communication  scheduling  credentialing and training service business for healthcare providers 
during the first quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the e staff business and decided to dispose of the subsidiary by winding down its operations 
e staff ceased operations as of march  at that time  we determined that approximately million of the net carrying amount of the assets from discontinued operations was impaired 
this impairment charge was taken as a loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of the assets of our predecessor  cross country staffing  a partnership  as well as from subsequent acquisitions were million and million  respectively  net of accumulated amortization  at december  we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
as of january  accordingly  goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
instead  we review impairment annually 
see critical accounting principles and estimates where discussed further 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years

refer to legal proceedings for a more comprehensive discussion of this litigation 
excluding this charge to direct operating expenses  our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue would have decreased primarily due to a widening of our bill pay spread in our tr avel nurse staffing business  a higher relative mix of business from our other human capital management services business segment which operates with relatively lower direct costs than our healthcare staffing business segment  and lower field health insurance expenses

year ended december  compared to year ended december  healthcare staffing revenue from our healthcare staffing business segment decreased million or from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease in ftes  representing million of the decrease  partially offset by price and mix factors as described below 
the average number of ftes on contract decreased from the prior year 
this decline in volume was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel staffing operations partially offset by higher ftes in our clinical trials staffing  allied staffing and international recruitment businesses 
our nurse staffing operations experienced a weakening throughout and due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers which reduced the level of demand for our nurse staffing services along with a reduced level of interest of nursing professionals in pursuing temporary employment opportunities 
despite a more favorable demand and supply environment in our core nurse staffing business in  as discussed above  our staffing volume decreased year over year due  in part  to hospital in patient admissions trends that remained relatively flat during furthermore  we believe staffing volumes would have been higher absent the impact of hurricane wilma on the productivity of our recruiters in october we estimated the impact of hurricane wilma on our fourth quarter s results was approximately million of revenue and per diluted share 
while the hurricane occurred in the fourth quarter of  we will experience the majority of its impact on our field fte count in the first quarter of revenue per fte and average bill rates increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as discussed above 
mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll  accounted for approximately of our volume in our healthcare staffing business segment in year ended december  compared to of volume in the year ended december  for the year ended december   nurse staffing operations generated of healthcare staffing revenue and was generated by other operations

other human capital management services revenue from other human capital management services for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  both our educational training and retained search businesses contributed to the revenue increase 
the increase in revenue from our educational training business primarily reflects a higher number of seminars in the year ended december  compared to the year ending december  contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased revenue combined with improved operating leverage

for comparison purposes only  on a stand alone basis  medstaff s revenue for the year ended december  decreased by million or compared to the year ended december  on a combined basis  the number of ftes decreased by over the prior year 
excluding the ftes from the medstaff acquisition  the average number of ftes on contract decreased from the prior year 
this decline in volume was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel staffing operations and partially offset by higher ftes in our clinical trials staffing and international recruitment businesses 
as discussed above  our travel nurse operations have weakened throughout and due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers which reduced the level of demand for our nurse staffing services and resulted in a decline in the number of nurses applying with us for contract travel assignments 
revenue per fte decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average bill rates  excluding hospital sponsored pass through bonuses and administrative and co marketing expenses  in our organic nurse staffing business during the year ended december   were lower than the year ended december  our pricing was negatively impacted by co marketing and third party administrative fees as well as a reduction in hospital sponsored pass through bonuses that are accounted for in revenue 
fees relating to the co marketing arrangements we have with group purchasing organizations in which we have exclusive or preferred provider status  and third party administrative fees relating to vendor managed programs are included as an offset to revenue 
we have experienced an increase in co marketing expenses as we secure more preferred provider relationships and an increase in vendor ma nagement services being utilized by our customers 
in addition  the mix of business also contributed to the decrease in revenue per fte as the incremental per diem business from medstaff in had lower average bill rates than our organic travel nurse business

all of these factors  combined with less leverage on our overhead  contributed to this decrease in contribution income as a percentage of revenue

the commitments under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company

critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and performed a transitional impairment analysis as of january   to assess the recoverability of these intangibles  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarters of  and based on the results of the tests  we determined that there was no impairment of continuing operations goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december    and the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets held for sale to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge on goodwill reported as discontinued operations of million relating to the remaining consulting practice classified as held for sale at that time 
an additional impairment charge of million was also recorded in discontinued operations related to these net assets 
fair value was based on the latest offer received for the sale of the net assets of the remaining consulting practice 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the remaining consulting practice and shut down the remaining operations 
we estimated the remaining costs associated with the shut down of the business and recorded these costs in loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of these costs were allocated to the impairment valuation previously recorded 
any adjustments to these estimated amounts will be recorded to discontinued operations in subsequent periods 
we do not expect these final adjustments to be material and we expect all final adjustments to be completed by the first quarter of when we determined that we would win d down operations of the e staff business without a buyer  an impairment of million was recognized and included in the loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued employee compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
historically  our accruals for insurance have been adequate to provide for incurred claims 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of d ecember  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
prior to  only our field employees were covered through a partially self insured health plan  corporate employees were covered through a fully insured plan 
beginning in  the corporate employees were also covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december   and  million  respectively  of the incurred but not reported health insurance claims accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation and professional liability insurance accruals have generally increased over time due to the lag times associated with the settlement of claims as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  net of related insurance recovery receivables  an increase of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an independent actuarial study  which estimated the required net workers compensation accrual at december  to be in the range of million to million 
as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions net of related insurance recovery receivables 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an independent actuarial study  which estimated the required net professional liability accrual at december  to be in the range of million to million 
refer to legal proceedings for more information about specific material litigation 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against the company  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business  is described in item legal proceedings 
neither cossack  et al 
v 
cross country travcorps and cross country nurses  inc nor maureen petray and carina higareda v 
medstaff  inc has been certified by a court as a class action 
in addition  the lawsuit brought by maureen petray and carina higareda against medstaff  inc is in its very early stages 
as a result  we are unable to determine our potential exposure regarding these two lawsuits at this time 
on february   the united states district court for the central district of california filed an order denying certification of a collective action pursuant to usc section b fair labor standards act claims without prejudice and holding on submission plaintiff s rule motion for certification of a class action solely with respect to california employees based on california law for darrelyn renee henry vs 
medstaff  inc  cross country healthcare  inc  victor kalafa  tim rodden  talia pico and melissa hetrick 
we are unable to determine our potential exposure regarding this lawsuit at this time 
during the second quarter of  the company increased its reserve for professional liabili ty insurance by million  pretax  based on an independent actuarial calculation which reflected unfavorable developments relating to two lawsuits in the circuit court of cook county  illinois 
the company is currently engaged in settlement discussions and expects to settle the cook county matters consistent with the previously established accrual range 
we will continue to evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as required 
we are currently not aware of any other such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals at that time 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
fasb statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fasb statement r is similar to the approach described in fasb statement however  fasb statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule deferring the compliance date for fas r to the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we intend to adopt fasb statement no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective transition method 
we have disclosed the pro forma impact of adopting fasb statement no 
r on net income and earnings per share for the years ended december    and in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
we expect there to be no further impact on our consolidated statements of income related to the current share based payments outstanding at december  due to the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested options in the fourth quarter of see note summary of significant accounting policies and in note stockholder s equity for further discussion 
we cannot predict the earnings impact of awards that may be granted in the future 
in adopting fas r  companies must choose from alternative valuation models 
we currently use the black scholes method for disclosures and expect to continue to use this method 
we will consider using another model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate for our company  or  if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using black scholes 
in prior periods we did not estimate forfeitures when valuing options as permitted by fasb statement but we have revised our accounting policy to estimate forfeitures in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
r  effective january  inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit facility  which bears interest based on floating rates 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million in  and million in
