item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized approximately million related to environmental and safety control facilities and we also incurred and expensed an additional million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we also expect to capitalize million related to environmental and safety control facilities during the year ending december  and also expect to incur and expense charges of approximately million related to environmental during the year ending december  
table of contents item a 
risk factors certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  and medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face the continuing impact on economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as well as current tensions in iraq and the rest of the middle east 
terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  terrorist attacks  compounded with changes in the national economy  resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions appear to be improving  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current tensions in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war for our aviation products 

table of contents if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
commencing in  we embarked on a company wide program to implement lean manufacturing techniques 
we believe that this process will produce meaningful reductions in manufacturing costs 
however  implementation of these techniques may cause short term inefficiencies in production 
if we ultimately are unable to successfully implement these processes our anticipated profitability may suffer 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  which could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and energy 
table of contents products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire in the future will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
if we can not pass on higher raw material or manufacturing costs to our customers  we may become less profitable 
one of the ways we attempt to manage the risk of higher raw material and manufacturing costs is to increase selling prices to our customers 
the markets we serve are extremely competitive and customers may not accept price increases or may look to alternative suppliers which may negatively impact our profitability and revenues 

table of contents if our suppliers can not provide us with adequate quantities of materials to meet our customers demands on a timely basis or if the quality of the materials provided does not meet our standards we may lose customers or experience lower profitability 
some of our customer contracts require us to compensate them if we do not meet specified delivery obligations 
we rely on numerous suppliers to provide us with our required materials and in many instances these materials must meet certain specifications 
during and we experienced diminished supplier performance that negatively impacted our operating and net income 
the diminished supplier performance was the result of the closure suppliers  problems with new supplier on time delivery reliability as well as lower than expected new supplier qualification acceptance 
we are in the process of remediating or have taken steps to remediate these lower supplier performance issues and believe the diminished impact on profitability may be alleviated 
a continuation of these factors could have a negative impact on our ability to deliver our products to our customers within our committed time frames and could result in continued reductions of our operating and net income in future periods 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan  where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to timely meet our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and curing any violations of these regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our 
table of contents processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations on importing and exporting practices and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws and international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of such regulations could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
if either management or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that exist as of the end of our fiscal year  the material weakness es will be reported either by management in its self assessment or by our independent registered public accounting firm in their report or both  which may result in a loss of public confidence and could have an adverse affect on our business and our stock price 
this could also result in significant additional expenditures responding to the section internal control audit and a diversion of management attention 
we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is 
table of contents limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the costs associated with the defense of asbestos related claims and the payment of any judgments or settlements with respect to such claims are subject to a number of uncertainties 
as such  we cannot guarantee that such claims ultimately will not have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in general  any components containing asbestos formerly used in our products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and maintenance 
as such  we have no basis on which to conclude that these cases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs of these claims 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
nonetheless  if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or 
table of contents taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our senior note purchase agreement  dated october   outstanding industrial revenue bonds  and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated december   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has in the past experienced price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of 
table of contents operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including significant manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations 
our executive office is located in burlington  massachusetts 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group has facilities located in the united states  germany  france  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
properties in ronkonkoma  new york  berlin  connecticut  ontario  california  le plessis trevise  france  and spartanburg  south carolina  are leased 
the energy products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  italy and the people s republic of china 
properties in nerviano  italy  naviglio  italy  edmonton  alberta  canada  beaumont  texas  a distribution center in oklahoma city  oklahoma are leased 
certain of our facilities are subject to collateral assignments under loan agreements with long term lenders 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends and by successful implementation of our on going lean manufacturing initiatives 
item legal proceedings we  like other worldwide manufacturing companies  are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations  including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws 
we maintain liability insurance coverage which we believe to be consistent with industry practices 
nonetheless  such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims  which may arise from product defects and failures or from environmental liability 
we  like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in particular  our subsidiaries  leslie  spence  and 
table of contents hoke  collectively have been named as defendants or third party defendants in asbestos related claims brought on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs typically against anywhere from to defendants 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as successor in interest to one or more of these subsidiaries 
these cases have been brought in state courts in alabama  california  connecticut  georgia  illinois  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  mississippi  montana  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  texas  utah  virginia  washington and wyoming with the vast majority of claimants having brought their claims in mississippi 
the cases brought on behalf of the vast majority of claimants seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in the aggregate 
however  the complaints filed on behalf of claimants who do seek specified compensatory and punitive damages typically seek millions or tens of millions of dollars in damages against the aggregate of defendants 
of the approximately  plaintiffs who have brought claims against our subsidiaries  all but approximately have been in mississippi 
recently in mississippi  the courts have rendered decisions and the legislature has passed legislation aimed at curbing certain abusive practices by plaintiff attorneys pursuant to which large numbers of unrelated plaintiffs sometimes numbering in the thousands in a single case would be grouped in the same case against hundreds of defendants 
as a result of the recent changes  many of these mass filings including some cases in which circor companies have been named defendant have been or are expected to be dismissed 
while it is possible that certain dismissed claims would be refiled in mississippi or in other jurisdictions  any such refilings likely would be made on behalf of one or a small number of related individuals who can demonstrate actual injury and some connection to our subsidiaries products 
any components containing asbestos formerly used in leslie  spence and hoke products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
moreover  to date  our insurers have been paying the vast majority of the costs associated with the defense of these actions  particular with respect to spence and hoke for which insurance has paid all defense costs to date 
as we previously have disclosed  we negotiated a revised cost sharing understanding with leslie s insurers which results in leslie being responsible for of its defense costs 
in light of the foregoing  we currently believe that we have no basis on which to conclude that these cases may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims including our co defendants  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs to us of these claims 
we have reviewed all of our pending judicial and legal proceedings  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings  and availability and limits of our insurance coverage  and we have established reserves that we believe are appropriate in light of those outcomes that we believe are probable and estimable at this time

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview circor international  inc is a leading provider of valves and fluid control products for the industrial  aerospace and petrochemical markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
we have organized the company into two segments instrumentation thermal fluid controls products and energy products 
the instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including military and commercial aerospace  chemical processing  marine  power generation  hvac systems  food and beverage processing  and other general industrial markets 
the energy products segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
our growth strategy includes both organic sales increases as well as strategic acquisitions that complement and extend our current offering of engineered flow control products 
for organic growth  
table of contents our businesses focus on developing new products and reacting quickly to changes in market conditions in order to help grow our revenues 
regarding acquisitions  we have made twelve acquisitions in the last five years that extended our product offerings 
ten of these acquisitions were in our instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment 
during the last three years  our acquisitions of dqs and tsi in provided us with a larger presence in the analytical sampling market 
in april  we acquired mallard  which added to our energy products segment and our acquisitions of loud in january and industria in october provided us with complementary aerospace component and subassembly manufacturing capabilities 
in february  we acquired hale hamilton  a leading provider of high pressure valves and flow control equipment  and sagebrush which provides pipeline flow control and measurement equipment to oil and gas markets 
regarding our financial results  we had a number of improvements over our revenues increased over and included significant organic growth in many of the key end markets we serve  especially shipments to large international oil and gas projects 
our fiscal performance also benefited from three strategic acquisitions loud and industria acquired in  plus the full year impact of mallard  acquired in april net income in increased significantly over  benefiting from the contribution of increased revenues and reduced inventory write downs 
the profit contribution from the higher sales volume plus customer price increases was partially offset by higher costs from new initiatives 
for example  in order to further improve our profitability and increase working capital turns  we consolidated additional facilities in and started implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  beginning with training employees at our larger us plants and conducting associated kaizan events in our internal manufacturing processes 
we also continued to further expand our foreign sourcing programs  especially for certain businesses in our instrumentation and thermal fluid products segment 
while all of these initiatives are investments to improve the long term financial health of the company  we did incur higher costs in as a result of these actions 
in we reduced our debt  resulting in a low debt to capital ratio of  and also reduced working capital  net of cash  to of revenues 
we also generated a significant amount of cash in cash flow from operating activities was million  or of revenues  an increase of million compared to million generated in we continue to believe our largest opportunity to generate increased cash flow from operating activities is by further reducing our inventories 
to help us with the lean manufacturing initiatives  we have engaged a consulting firm to assist us with their implementation 
with the assistance of this consulting firm  we expect to improve our inventory turns and systemically quicken our order fulfillment processes over the next few years 
we also used a significant amount of cash in  including net cash payments of million primarily for the loud and industria acquisitions and the buyout of the minority interest in skvc  million on capital expenditures  and a scheduled payment of million to reduce our senior notes 
as we ended  we maintained a position of having nearly as much cash and cash equivalents as debt 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and energy products 

table of contents we operate and report financial information using a week fiscal year ending december the data periods contained within our quarterly reports on form q reflect the results of operations for the week  week and week periods which generally end on the sunday nearest the calendar quarter end date 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for inventory our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  the reduction in our inventory allowance in is primarily attributable to the disposal of inventory included in the allowance 
we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by estimates of future demand 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
assumptions about future demand is one of the primary factors utilized to estimate market value 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the impact of our programs initiated during the past two years to increase the proportion of our inventory purchased from less expensive suppliers  primarily in asia and eastern europe 
one result of our successful foreign sourcing programs is that we need less internal manufacturing and warehousing capability  particularly in north america 
in addition  our past practice has been to retain much of our inventory for extended periods  even utilizing extra warehousing facilities and resources 
after considering these factors  we concluded that it is more cost effective to dispose of selected inventory and reduce warehouse capacity than to incur ongoing carrying costs 
we decided to lower our costs by disposing of certain inventories and consolidating facilities 
as a result of that decision  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter to write down our inventories 
we disposed of million of inventory in inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
purchase accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
we accrue estimates for certain costs  related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings  anticipated at the date of acquisition  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
business combinations and emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
adjustments to these estimates are made during the acquisition allocation period  which is generally up to twelve months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized 
subsequent to the allocation period  costs incurred in excess of the recorded acquisition accruals are generally expensed as incurred and if accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose the excess is recorded as an adjustment to the cost of the acquired entity  usually decreasing goodwill 
impairment analysis our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was compared with million as of december  we perform goodwill impairment tests for each reporting unit on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  if triggering events indicate impairment may have occurred 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of operating activities and capital expenditures of the reporting unit  a discount rate  and the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges 
based on impairment tests performed using independent third party valuations  there was no impairment in our goodwill in   or 
table of contents other long lived assets include property  plant  and equipment and intangibles with definite lives 
we perform impairment analyses of our other long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are expected to be less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of acquisition related costs  research and product development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
for  we expect an effective income tax rate of 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in  deferred income tax liabilities increased primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments relating to non goodwill intangibles 
the increase in the gross deferred tax asset relating to credit carryforwards resulted from the foreign tax associated with a distribution from one of our foreign subsidiaries  against which we have recorded a valuation allowance 
at december   our total valuation allowance is million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain foreign tax credits  state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings  some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an 
table of contents exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as legal proceedings in part i item pension benefits we maintain pension benefit plans for our employees in the united states 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was for compared to in the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was compared to in the lower discount rate reflected the decline in global capital markets and interest rates 
the combined effect of the reduced expected long term rate of return and discount rate we utilized for raised our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and raised our pension expense by approximately million 
plan assets are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor international  inc in the plan assets 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor are being recognized over approximately an eleven year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december  exceeded the estimated accumulated benefit obligations primarily as a result of the cash contributions from the company  partially offset by the lower interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the benefit plans 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
in  we do not expect to make voluntary cash contributions  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
for  we lowered our discount rate for pension liabilities by basis points to on a weighted average basis given the level of global interest rates 
the effect of the reduction in the assumed discount rate is expected to raise our projected benefit obligation by approximately million and raise pension expense by approximately million 

table of contents we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  such adjustments could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differ from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced

revenues increased an incremental million from the january acquisition of loud and by million from the acquisition of industria in october the acquisitions were complemented by additional organic increases in product sales to general industrial and chemical processing end markets 
incoming orders increased  excluding loud and industria  and benefited nearly every business unit stemming largely from higher selling prices instituted by the businesses in the second half of and in during mid  we experienced a softening in the commercial hvac projects market negatively impacting our thermal fluid products group 
in  management expects market conditions to remain steady for most of the general industrial  chemical processing and aerospace end markets served by this segment 
we expect a revenue increase approximating for the full year compared to the full year  plus approximately million in incremental revenue from our october acquisition of industria and approximately million from our february acquisition of hale hamilton 
energy products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a portion of the increase in revenues was the net result of an incremental million from the april  acquisition of mallard 
the acquisition impact also was complemented by additional organic increases in revenues as an escalation in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas motivated producers to increase their drilling  production  and distribution facilities 
revenues from our north american operations increased million over  and our italian subsidiary  pibiviesse  increased revenues million over pibiviesse continues to be successful in winning and fulfilling orders for large international oil and gas projects  a majority of which are for national energy companies in the middle east 
in  our expectations for this segment s revenues are to increase by to over  plus approximately million in incremental revenue from our february acquisition of sagebrush 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  consolidated gross margin of for the year ended december  was an increase of basis points from the prior year period 
gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year and was primarily the result of two factors million primarily from the incremental contribution of the acquisitions of loud and industria  and million due to the net benefit of higher volume of shipments and customer price increases partially offset by higher raw material costs  especially stainless steel  unforeseen costs from decreased vendor responsiveness  and lower factory productivity 

table of contents gross profit for the energy products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the gross profit increase was the net effect of million from the higher sales volume and related customer pricing increases  net of additional operating costs to regain manufacturing productivity in our oklahoma city plant after the summer and fall consolidation of two other us plants into that facility  selected raw material shortages  a million charge in the fourth quarter of primarily for slow moving inventory that was not incurred in  and million from the april acquisition of mallard 
regarding both segments gross margins  we had anticipated developing a faster production capability in the key us plants where we began to implement lean manufacturing initiatives which would have enabled us to complete facility consolidation projects more timely 
however  added operational costs plus unforeseen constraints on the supply of certain raw materials and the inability of certain suppliers to respond to our increasing needs contributed to gross margins in both segments that were lower than our own expectations 
in response to these issues  in  we intend to strengthen our supplier management processes and foreign sourcing programs  re direct lean initiatives to focus on manufacturing constraints  initiate further facility consolidations  and accelerate rationalization of the manufacturing of certain product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by million primarily as a result from incremental expense from our acquisitions of loud and industria 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy products segment increased million  including million from incremental expense from our april acquisition of mallard  and million in higher expenses in our other ongoing businesses for increased sales personnel plus higher commissions and variable compensation 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million the prior year 
the increase was primarily from higher compensation related costs  staffing  project consulting fees  and corporate development expenses 
regarding corporate expenses  our estimate includes incremental equity based compensation  compared to we will adopt the new accounting rule  fas r  requiring the expensing of stock options  which will include an additional pretax expense of million or per diluted share 
we are also expecting an incremental pretax cost of million or per diluted share for restricted share units to be granted in these equity based compensation increases will be partially offset by other expected reductions in consulting fees  variable compensation and audit fees 
special charges special charges of million were recognized for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the special charges recognized in the year ended 
table of contents december  primarily related to severance charges of million incurred in connection with our announced consolidation and reduction in force at our mallard  sart and european instrumentation businesses  offset by the release of a million accrual for facility closure related costs recorded in operating income the change in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows year ended segment december  december  total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange in thousands instrumentation thermal fluid controls energy corporate total operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment for the year ended december  increased million 
the increase included the acquisitions of loud and industria  customer price increases that became effective in the second half of and during  savings from facility closings completed in the first half of  and was partially offset by the sale of higher cost inventory containing stainless steel and related specialty alloys  unforeseen costs from decreased vendor performance  and lower factory productivity 
operating income for the energy products segment increased million  or for the year ended december   primarily due to a million charge in the fourth quarter of primarily related to charges in warehousing and inventory carrying practices  higher volume of shipments by the north american and pibiviesse business units  the incremental contribution from the april mallard acquisition  partially offset by higher expenses in our ongoing businesses for increased sales personnel plus higher commissions and variable compensation 
in  based on our expected revenue increases over  we anticipate full year adjusted operating margins  which excludes the impact of special charges  in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment to approximate to and the energy products segment to approximate to 
both segments are expected to continue to be affected by keen competitive pricing  high raw material and energy costs as well as facility consolidation costs 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the reduction in net 
table of contents interest expense was primarily due to the million lower outstanding balance of our senior unsecured notes since the principal payment in october  partially offset by lower interest income in associated with lower invested cash  cash equivalents and investments in as compared to provision for taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  which was a decrease from the used for the year ended december  this effective tax rate reduction is due to higher domestic and international tax benefits and credits in the increase in income taxes in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to higher income before income taxes this year offset by the lower tax rate 
net income net income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this net increase is primarily attributable to the after tax charge for inventory of million related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices  incremental profit from acquisitions  customer price increases  higher volume shipments  cost reductions from closed facilities  a lower income tax rate and lower net interest expense offset by the sale of higher cost inventory containing stainless steel and related specialty alloys  production difficulties as we implement lean manufacturing processes and consolidate facilities  unabsorbed manufacturing costs resulting from inventory reductions  unforeseen costs from decreased vendor performance  and higher selling  commissions and corporate expenses 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  many of the general industrial end markets we serve began to emerge from a multiple year slump 
the stronger foreign currencies such as the euro continued a positive effect on our financial results as well as the full year impact of the acquisitions of dqs and tsi purchased in the fourth quarter of we also acquired mallard in april which added to our financial results 
in  the majority of our businesses focused on trimming spending proportional to customer order rates  completing the consolidation of three facilities and closing a fourth facility  developing new products and improving customer service levels to maintain and increase market share 
in the fourth quarter  we evaluated the impact of our programs initiated during the past two years to increase the proportion of our inventory purchased from less expensive suppliers  primarily in asia and eastern europe 
one result of our successful foreign sourcing programs is that we need less internal manufacturing and warehousing capability  particularly in north america 
in addition  our past practice has been to retain much of our inventory for extended periods  even utilizing extra warehousing facilities and resources

the energy products segment accounted for and of net revenues for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
the change in the composition of revenues was favorably influenced by foreign exchange rate changes and the incremental revenues added from the fourth quarter acquisitions of dqs and tsi in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment  and the april acquisition of mallard in the energy products segment 
revenues in for both 
table of contents segments were helped by customer price increases implemented by most of our business units 
this was the first time in recent years that we had implemented broad based price increases across many of our business units as a response to rising metals costs for raw materials that we purchased in instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenues increased primarily due to the incremental million of revenue contributed by the acquisitions of dqs and tsi  plus million due to the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates changes 
the revenue increase from operations of million was primarily the result of higher revenues from aerospace product lines of million  partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from thermal fluid controls product sales to the maritime market 
we implemented customer price increases in most businesses in the second and third quarters of to help offset the rise in certain metal prices from vendors 
energy products revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the net increase in revenues for this segment was the net result of the mallard acquisition which added million of revenues and favorable foreign exchange rate changes which provided an additional million of revenue  partially offset by million of lower shipments to large international oil and gas projects during the second and third quarters of gross profit gross profit from the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the incremental gross profit of million from the acquisitions of dqs and tsi in november and december the increase from acquisitions was supplemented by increases of million from the foreign exchange effect of the stronger euro and british pound sterling in the remaining gross profit decline of million from is the net result of several factors including lower unit volume to the maritime and general industrial customers  higher unit volume to aerospace customers  added manufacturing costs for three now completed plant consolidations  higher raw material costs due to rising metals prices  partially offset by customer price increases instituted and affecting second half revenues  and a fourth quarter million charge for inventory on the business decision to change warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
gross profit for the energy products segment decreased a net million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross profit declined from from a million charge in the fourth quarter of  related to our decision to change our warehousing and inventory carrying practices  and by million from lower unit volume and unfavorable mix of shipments to large international oil and gas projects and higher raw material costs due to rising metals prices  partially offset by customer price increases instituted and affecting second half revenues 
these negative factors were offset by gross profit increases of million from the mallard acquisition plus a million increase from the strengthened euro and canadian dollar

energy products segment selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was the net result of million of incremental costs due to our mallard acquisition and million of increases due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by a net million in lower operating costs incurred in our north american operations 
corporate expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily for compliance costs for the new requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts in entailed testing internal controls and documenting those test results at our most significant businesses 
special charges special charges of million incurred during the twelve months ended december  were primarily related to the write down of a building classified as held for sale within our energy products segment 
during the third quarter it was determined that the fair value and other incremental costs to sell the building would result in a lower net realizable value of the asset held for sale 
special charges of less than million incurred during the first quarter were primarily severance and facility costs related to the announced closure and consolidation of a california facility within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment of million  million of other closure related items  offset by the gain on the sale of our ohio property of million  also within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment 
as a result of the closure of our california facility  employee positions were eliminated 
special charges of million incurred during the year ended december  were primarily related to incremental costs for the closure of an ohio facility within our instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment and a building write down within our energy products segment

these increases were offset by the fourth quarter inventory charge of million which related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
operating income for the energy products segment decreased million  or for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the fourth quarter inventory charge of million related to changes in our warehousing and inventory carrying practices 
in addition  higher raw material costs and lower second and third quarter product shipments to large international oil and gas projects were offset by favorable foreign exchange rates of million and the mallard acquisition which added million of operating income 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense was primarily due to the million annual principal payments against our senior unsecured notes in october of and which reduced our outstanding balance 
other income  net other income  net decreased million from million for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the change was primarily attributable to a reduction of foreign currency exchange gains 
provision for taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period last year 
the lower effective tax rate benefited from income tax benefits recorded in 
table of contents the fourth quarter of totaling million  which included tax credits for product development and research activities  the majority of which related to prior years and a reduction of our income tax liability for certain items

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

foreign currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses are recognized when hedged transactions affect earnings  which are generally in the same period as the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   we did not have any forward contracts to buy or sell foreign currencies 
there were no unrealized gains attributable to foreign currency forward contracts at december  and the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
our risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties is not significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation
