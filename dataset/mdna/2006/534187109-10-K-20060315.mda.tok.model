branding branding is a key element of our strategy 
our branding efforts are focused on two primary target audiences financial intermediaries where we work to build brand familiarity and very affluent consumers top of the population where we work to build name awareness 
in  we continued to build our brand on a national basis through an integrated package of consumer print and television  trade print and internet advertising  sponsorships  and promotional events 
as a result  we believe that our awareness among our financial intermediary and targeted consumer audiences increased in business segments and other operations lincoln retirement overview the lincoln retirement segment  with principal operations in fort wayne  indiana  and hartford  connecticut  and additional operations in portland  maine  and arlington heights  illinois  provides tax deferred investment growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable annuities  and other retirement products 
there are two lines of business within this segment  individual markets and employer sponsored markets 
capitalizing on a broad product portfolio and a strong and diverse distribution network  lincoln retirement is a leader in both the individual and employer sponsored annuity markets 
according to variable annuity research and data services vards  lnc ranked th in assets and th in individual variable annuity sales for the year ended december  in the united states 
the individual annuities line of business offers non qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to individuals 
annuities are attractive because they provide tax deferred growth in the underlying principal  thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values  often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement 
in addition to favorable tax treatment  annuities are unique in that retirees can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for life 
the individual annuities market has seen an increase in competition along with new product types and promotion 
the guarantee features living and death benefits offered within an annuity are not found in any other investment vehicle  and we believe  make annuities attractive even in times of economic uncertainty 
the employer sponsored line of business offers fixed and variable annuities along with a turnkey retirement program  the alliance program  to targeted markets 
the key market segments of the employer sponsored business are healthcare  public governmental  education  corporate and not for profits 
within these segments  we target those markets that offer the most favorable demographics  distribution synergies and current and potential market share 
products in general  an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company  after receipt of one or more contributions  agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis ie  annually  semi annually  quarterly or monthly  beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract 
such payments can begin the month after the deposit is received referred to as an immediate annuity or at a future date in time referred to as a deferred annuity 
this retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable annuity 
the lincoln retirement segment s deposits for the periods indicated were as follows year ended december  in billions individual annuities variable fixed total individual annuities employer sponsored annuities variable fixed total employer sponsored annuities excluding alliance fixed alliance total alliance mutual funds total employer sponsored products total annuity and alliance deposits variable fixed total annuities and alliance total alliance program deposits variable annuities a variable annuity provides the contractholder the ability to direct the investment of deposits into one or more sub accounts offered through the product variable portion or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return fixed portion 
the value of the variable portion of the contractholder s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub accounts chosen by the contractholder 
the underlying assets of the sub accounts are managed within a special insurance series of funds  similar to mutual funds 
the contractholder s return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the variable annuity  ie  the contractholder bears the investment risk associated with these investments  except for the impact of guaranteed benefit features 
the value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general account liabilities 
account values of variable annuities were billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  including the fixed portions of variable accounts of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we charge mortality and expense assessments on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative charges 
these assessments are built into accumulation unit values  which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any sub account equals the contractholder s account value for that sub account 
some products feature decreasing fee schedules based on account value break points 
the fees that we earn from these policies are reported as insurance fees on the income statement 
in addition  for some contracts  we collect surrender charges that range from to of withdrawals generally higher during the early years of a contract when contractholders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period of their contract 
our individual variable annuity products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years 
we offer a share  b share  c share  l share and bonus variable annuities 
the differences in a  b  c  l and bonus shares relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract 
an a share has a front end sales charge and no back end contingent deferred sales charge  also known as a surrender charge 
net premium premium less front end charge is invested in the contract 
the a share generally offers the lowest cost to the client and full liquidity 
a b share has a seven year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract s specified surrender charge period 
all of the premium is invested in the contract  but it offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge period 
a c share has no front end sales charge or back end surrender charge 
accordingly  it offers maximum liquidity but other expenses are higher than those for a or b shares 
an l share has a four to five year contingent deferred sales charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract s specified surrender charge period 
the differences between the l share and b share are the length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure 
l shares have a shorter surrender charge period  so for the added liquidity  mortality and expense assessments are higher 
it offers a persistency credit in year seven to revert pricing to b share levels 
a bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified percentage typically ranging from to of each deposit 
the entire premium plus the bonus are invested in the sub accounts supporting the contract 
it has a seven to nine year contingent deferred sales charge 
the expenses are slightly more than those for a b share 
we also offer bonus annuity products with persistency credits beginning in years eight or fifteen to revert bonus pricing back to b share pricing levels 
our variable annuity products are offered to both individuals and the employer sponsored market under a variety of names american legacy  lincoln choice plus sm  and multi fund 
certain of our variable annuity products offer features  such as a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb  a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb and a combination of such benefits 
most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account value 
the separate account choices for our variable annuities cover diverse asset classes with varying levels of risk and include both equity funds and fixed income funds 
the multi fund variable annuity product line offers up to approximately fund choices from well known advisors  including american funds insurance series sm  delaware investments sm  and scudder investments

american legacy variable annuity accounted for  and of variable annuity deposits in  and  respectively 
in addition  the american legacy variable annuity product line represented approximately  and of our total variable annuity account values at december   and  respectively 
as stated above  certain of our variable annuities offer a gmdb feature 
approximately of variable annuity separate account values had a gmdb feature at december   and the gmdb features include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder either a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals  b total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return  or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date minus any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
the lincoln smart security sm advantage benefit is a gmwb feature that offers the contractholder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit or contract value  if elected after issue  adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals 
there are two elective step up options a one year and a five year option 
the one year option allows an owner to step up the guarantee automatically if the contract value is greater than the initial deposit on the benefit anniversary for years  with an optional election of an additional year step up period if the owner is age eligible 
the five year option allows the owner to step up the guarantee amount on or after the fifth anniversary of the election or of the most recent step up if the contract value is greater than the initial deposit 
to receive the full amount of the guarantee  annual withdrawals are limited to either of the guaranteed amount for the one year step up or of the guaranteed amount for the five year step up 
withdrawals in excess of the applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges  and the guaranteed amount is recalculated 
the charge for this benefit with the one year step up is annually of the guaranteed amount less withdrawals and annually of the guaranteed amount less withdrawals for the five year step up  both assessed on a quarterly basis 
the charge may be waived under certain circumstances 
the benefit may also be cancelled at any time five years after election or owner elected step up of the guaranteed amount 
if cancelled  the benefit may be re elected after one year if the benefit is still offered 
the lincoln smart security sm advantage is available on new and existing variable annuity contracts for most of our individual variable annuity products 
approximately  and of variable annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively  had elected a gmwb feature 
to mitigate the increased risks associated with gmdbs and gmwbs  we developed a dynamic hedging program 
the customized dynamic hedging program uses equity and interest rate futures positions as well as equity based options depending upon the risks underlying the guarantees 
our program is designed to offset both positive and negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees 
however  while we actively manage these hedge positions  the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to  among other things  the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions  extreme swings in the equity markets  contractholder behavior  and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices 
for more information on our hedging program  see critical accounting policies insurance and investment contract obligations of the md a 
for information regarding risks related to gmdbs and gmwbs  see risk factors below 
we offer other product riders including the incomelife solution and ilife advantage 
there is an annual charge of on account value for this feature 
the incomelife and ilife features  on which we have received a us patent  allow variable annuity contractholders access and control during the income distribution phase of their contract 
this added flexibility allows the contractholder to access the account value for transfers  additional withdrawals and other service features like portfolio rebalancing 
in september  the guaranteed income benefit gib feature was added to ilife advantage 
the gib is an optional feature that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below of the initial income payment 
the annual charge for the optional gib feature is of the account value 
the gib may be terminated on an ilife advantage contract and regular income payment will no longer be subject to this minimum income payment guarantee 
approximately of ilife advantage contracts elected the gib feature in  and approximately elected it in during  a return of premium death benefit option was added to ilife advantage to better align the death benefits available with the underlying product chassis 
approximately  and less than of variable annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively  have elected an ilife feature 
fixed annuities a fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value 
we offer both single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities market 
single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single contribution to be made 
flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple contributions on either a scheduled or non scheduled basis 
with fixed deferred annuities  the contractholder has the right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and  if applicable  a market value adjustment mva 
also  certain fixed annuity products allow for a window period between the end of the fixed guarantee period and the start of the subsequent guarantee period during which the contractholder can withdraw their funds without incurring a surrender charge 
fixed annuity contributions are invested in our general account 
we bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts 
to protect from premature withdrawals  we impose surrender charges 
surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract  with a declining level of surrender charge over time 
we expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contractholders accounts 
fixed annuity account values were billion  billion and billion at december   and approximately billion  billion and billion of fixed annuity account values at december   and  respectively  were still within the surrender charge period 
our fixed annuity product offerings as of december  include the lincoln select and choiceplus fixed annuities  stepthree and choiceguarantee fixed annuities 
these products allow an individual to select a specific guaranteed period typically ranging from one to ten years 
if the contract stays in force for the entire guarantee period  then the contract will earn the specified rate of interest for the full period 
if a lincoln select or choiceplus fixed annuity contract is surrendered during the guarantee period  both a surrender charge and an mva may be applied 
the mva feature increases or decreases the contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates 
the increase and decrease on the contract value is generally offset by increases and decreases in the value of the underlying assets 
however  in a rising interest rate environment the contractholder s contract value cannot drop below the non forfeiture value subjecting us to interest rate risk 
fixed annuities with an mva feature constituted  and of total fixed annuity account values at the end of  and  respectively 
alliance program our alliance program  which is offered in the employer sponsored market  bundles our traditional fixed annuity products with the employer s choice of retail mutual funds  along with recordkeeping and employee education components

competition the annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies  with no one company dominating the market for all products 
the lincoln retirement segment competes with numerous other financial services companies 
the main factors upon which entities in this market compete are wholesaling  investment performance  cost  product features  speed to market  brand recognition  financial strength ratings  distribution channel access  crediting rates and client service 
lincoln retirement believes that its high service levels help it to compete in the annuities market

the lincoln retirement segment attempts to design products that meet the needs of clients in its markets 
the speed in which lincoln retirement s products reach the market is a competitive advantage 
generally  from concept of the product to launch  it takes us six to nine months 
over the last five years  the lincoln retirement segment has announced several new products and product features to market in response to the evolving nature of the annuities market 
life insurance overview the life insurance segment  with principal operations in hartford  connecticut and additional operations in fort wayne  indiana and schaumburg  illinois  focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance products 
the life insurance segment offers both single and survivorship versions of universal life ul  variable universal life vul  interest sensitive whole life iswl  corporate owned universal and variable universal life insurance coli and term insurance 
the segment also offers a linked benefit product  moneyguard  which is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide reimbursement for long term care costs 
the life insurance operation primarily targets the affluent market  defined as households with at least  of investable net worth 
for those policies we sold in  the average face amount excluding term  coli cases covering or more lives  and moneyguard was million and average first year premiums paid were approximately  products the life insurance segment sells interest market sensitive products ul  vul  iswl  coli and term products 
the life insurance segment s first year premiums excluding internal replacement premiums for the prior three years were as follows first year premiums year ended december in millions universal life excluding moneyguard moneyguard total universal life variable universal life whole life term products total retail coli total life insurance segment due to some seasonality in retail sales  we generally see more sales in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year 
approximately  and of total retail sales were in the first half of   and  with the remainder occurring in the second half of the year for the same periods 
in addition  the following table shows life policies face amount in force 
face amount in force at december in billions fixed variable term coli total life insurance segment mortality margins  investment margins through spreads or fees  net expense charges expense charges assessed to the policyholder less expenses incurred to manage the business and surrender fees drive life insurance profits 
mortality margins represent the difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the mortality risk and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid 
mortality charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder s policy account value ie  cost of insurance assessments or coi s or are embedded in the premiums charged to the customer 
in either case  these amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in force less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits 
insurance in force  in turn  is driven by sales  persistency and mortality experience 
similar to the annuity product classifications described above  life products can be classified as fixed or variable contracts 
this classification describes whether the policyholder or we bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy 
this also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products  either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset based fees charged to variable products 
we offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of fixed life insurance primarily ul  including moneyguard and iswl excluding coli fixed life insurance products provide life insurance with account cash values that earn rates of return based on company declared interest rates 
policyholder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio  so we bear the risk of investment performance 
some of our ul contracts include secondary guarantees  which are explained more fully later in the document 
in a ul contract  policyholders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit  provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming period 
under certain policyholder options and market conditions  the death benefit amount may increase or decrease 
premiums received on a ul product  net of expense loads and charges  are added to the policyholder s account value 
the client has access to their account value or a portion thereof through contractual liquidity features such as loans  partial withdrawals and full surrenders 
loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount  are limited to certain contractual maximums some of which are required under state law and interest is charged on all loans 
our ul contracts assess surrender charges against the policies account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur during the contractual surrender charge period 
depending on the product selected  surrender charge periods can range from to years 
iswl contracts have fixed premiums and guaranteed minimum cash values 
excess interest  mortality and expense credits are credited to policyholders based upon current expectations as to mortality experience  earned interest rates and expense factors 
these credits are declared at the beginning of the calendar year and are paid at the end of the policy year 
credits are used to purchase units of paid up insurance  purchase term insurance or reduce premium outlay 
policy loans are available at a variable interest rate 
we manage investment margins ie  the difference between the rate the portfolio earns compared to the rate that is credited to the customer by seeking to maximize current yields  in line with asset liability and risk management targets  while crediting a competitive rate to the customer 
crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract 
fixed life account values excluding vul and coli were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
variable universal life insurance vul excluding coli vul products are ul products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of sub accounts offered through the product 
the value of the policyholder s account varies with the performance of the sub accounts chosen by the policyholder 
the underlying assets of the sub accounts are managed within a special insurance series of funds 
premiums  net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses  received on vul products are invested in the policyholder s investment option selection 
as the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases  the account value of the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease 
as with fixed ul products  policyholders have access  within contractual maximums  to account values through loans  withdrawals and surrenders 
surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period generally ranging from to years depending on the product 
the investment choices we offer in vul products are the same  in most cases  as the investment choices offered in our individual variable annuity contracts 
in addition  vul products offer a fixed account option that is managed by lnc 
investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option 
we charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses  as well as asset based investment management fees 
vul account values excluding coli were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
term life insurance term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time 
it usually does not offer cash values

a return of premium term product  lincoln pro  has been offered since march corporate owned life insurance coli coli is typically purchased by corporations on the lives of its employees  with the corporation or a trust sponsored by the corporation named as a beneficiary under the policy  for the purpose of funding non qualified deferred compensation plans 
lnc offers a portfolio of both fixed ul and vul coli products sold primarily through specialty brokers 
coli account values were billion  billion and billion as of december   and as mentioned previously  we offer survivorship versions of our non coli ul  vul and iswl products 
these products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death 
the life insurance segment has continued to develop products that meet the changing needs of its target affluent market 
sales results continue to be heavily influenced by the series of universal life products with the lapse protection rider lpr  originally introduced in the lpr is a secondary guarantee that promises to keep a policy in force  even if the base policy account value is zero  as long as the no lapse value nlv of the policy remains positive 
the nlv is a reference value  calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value  but using different assumptions as to expense charges  coi charges  and credited interest 
the assumptions for the nlv calculation are listed in the contract 
as long as the policyholder funds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated nlv positive  the death benefit will be guaranteed 
the nlv has no actual monetary value to the policyholder  it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero 
unlike other guaranteed death benefit designs  the lpr maintains the flexibility of a traditional ul policy  which allows a policyholder to take loans or withdrawals 
although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the guaranteed death benefit  the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited  as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs 
the length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits 
during  we continued to monitor the regulatory changes that impact reserving for these products as well as the competitive environment 
lpr face amount in force was billion  billion and billion as of december   and in may  an updated version of our innovative single life lincoln vul one product was released 
originally developed in may  vul one combines the lapse protection of universal life with the upside potential of a traditional variable universal life product

vul one face amount in force was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively

underwriting in the context of life insurance  underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality 
this process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification 
of course  no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live  but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process

delaware manages both open end and closed end funds 
an open end mutual fund does not have a fixed number of shares and will normally offer as many shares as investors are willing to buy 
investors sell their shares by requesting the fund to redeem them 
the open end funds are available with various pricing structures  such as a class with a front end sales charge  b class and c class with a contingent deferred sales charge as well as r class and institutional class  which are sold without a front end or contingent deferred sales charge and are designed for certain retirement plans 
a  b  c and r classes are generally subject to rule b fees 
a closed end fund offers a fixed number of shares and is usually sold through a brokerage firm 
after the initial offering  shares normally trade on a major stock exchange 
a managed account is provided to investors through relationships with broker dealer sponsored programs

most clients utilize individually managed separate accounts  which means clients have the opportunity to customize the management of their portfolio by including or excluding certain types of securities  sectors or segments within a given asset class

lincoln uk lincoln uk is headquartered in barnwood  gloucester  england  and is licensed to do business throughout the united kingdom uk 
lincoln uk is primarily focused on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base 
the segment accepts new deposits on the existing block of business and markets a limited range of new products 
lincoln uk s product portfolio principally consists of unit linked life and pension products  which are similar to us produced variable life and annuity products  where the risk associated with the underlying investments are borne by the policyholders 
these products have largely been issued to individuals  and benefits  premium levels and charges can often be varied within limits 
certain policyholders have chosen to contract out of the state second pension through a lincoln personal pension arrangement 
lincoln uk receives rebate premiums from the government for those policyholders  and the vast majority of rebate premiums are usually received between july and november each year 
these rebates are reported as deposits and as such only the fees earned by lincoln uk are reported as revenue 
in  the total fees received in respect of these rebates amounted to million 
the lincoln uk segment s product revenues were as follows 
product revenues include premiums  fees and assessments for lincoln uk s products year ended december in millions life products pension products other products total our subsidiary in the uk has its balance sheets and income statements translated at the current spot exchange rate as of the year end and average spot exchange rate for the year  respectively 
lincoln uk has an evergreen agreement to outsource its customer service and policy administration functions to capita life pensions services limited  a subsidiary of capita group plc capita 
the purpose of the outsourcing is to reduce the operational risk and variability of future costs associated with administering the business by taking advantage of capita s proven expertise in providing outsourcing solutions to a variety of industries including insurance companies 
to date  the relationship has provided the segment with results in line with expectations 
other operations other operations include the financial data for the operations of lfa and lfd  and for operations that are not directly related to the business segments  unallocated corporate items such as corporate investment income and interest expense on short term and long term borrowings  along with the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the transaction with swiss re 
revenues from other operations were as follows in millions lfd lfa deferred gain amortization other total lfd revenues represent wholesaling allowances paid by our operating segments to lfd 
for and  lfa revenues do not include commissions  which were paid directly to its registered representatives  agents and brokers by our operating segments 
in  the arrangement was changed so that lfa receives the commission allowance as part of its distribution allowance from the operating segments and distributes directly to its registered representatives  agents and brokers 
as stated above  lfd  with principal operations in philadelphia  pennsylvania  is our wholesaling arm  which distributes our life insurance  annuities and investment products to a large number of financial intermediaries 
lfd was formed in to be the single distribution entity for all of our retail products 
through its customer focused relationships with financial intermediaries  we believe that lfd s distribution channels give us access to our target markets  while also providing us with market information so that we can tailor our products to the needs of our target markets 
at december   lfd consists of approximately internal and external wholesalers compared to internal and external wholesalers at december  both the internal and external wholesalers are lfd employees 
lfd is organized to penetrate multiple distribution channels including the wire regional  the independent planner  the financial institutions  the managing general agent  and the corporate specialty markets channels

lfa  through its nearly  agents  brokers and registered representatives in offices  offers our annuities  k plans  pensions  term  universal and variable universal life insurance and other wealth accumulation and protection products and services 
in addition  lfa is structured with an open architecture system  which means lfa s planners also offer products from non lnc companies 
during  lfa changed its compensation structure for its planners 
during this period  the number of new planners recruited to lfa was down relative to prior years  which is partially a result of lfa focusing more on recruiting experienced planners than it had in prior years 
lfa expects that recruiting trends will improve going forward 
reinsurance we follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity risks with unaffiliated reinsurers 
in a reinsurance transaction  a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium 
we use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss 
we also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing 
although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their policyholders for losses insured under the insurance policies  it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
we reinsure approximately to of the mortality risk on newly issued life insurance contracts 
our policy is to retain no more than million on a single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance contracts 
additionally  the retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for corporate owned life insurance coli is million and million  respectively 
beginning in september  we changed our reinsurance program for our primary term products from coinsurance to renewable term and from to on a first dollar quota share basis 
in january  we changed this program from first dollar quota share to an excess of retention program 
in a coinsurance program  the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial terms of the reinsured policies  ie premiums  expenses  claims  etc 
based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in a renewable term program  the reinsurer is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality risk assumed by the reinsurer 
in a first dollar quota share program  the reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in an excess of retention program  the reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life retention 
with respect to annuities  we have previously reinsured a portion of our fixed annuity business  but beginning in  we have retained the full risk on newly issued contracts 
for more information regarding reinsurance see  note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k and reinsurance in the md a 
for risks involving reinsurance  see risk factors below 
reserves the applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report  as liabilities  policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies 
these reserves are the amounts that  with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature 
these laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables  interest rates  and methods of valuation 
the reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance subsidiaries 
these differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables  interest  persistency and other assumptions which are believed to be more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and from differences in actuarial reserving methods 
see regulatory below for information on proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities 
the assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable 
if actual experience is not less favorable than the reserve assumptions  then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses 
if experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions  additional reserves may be required 
the key experience assumptions include mortality rates  policy persistency and interest rates 
we periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred  as we believe appropriate 
for risks related to reserves  see risk factors below 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets 
our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management  with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations 
this approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized  while still meeting our income objectives 
this approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset liability management  since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities 
investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes and income generation 
hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including  but not limited to  hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our gmdb gmwb liabilities  interest rate fluctuations  the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity us government obligations  and credit  foreign exchange and equity risks 
income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions rsats 
these derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt  similar to investing in the credit markets 
our investment portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers 
in addition  we do not have a significant concentration of investments in any single industry segment  no single segment comprises more than of invested assets at december  for additional information on our investments  including carrying values by category  quality ratings and net investment income  see consolidated investments in the md a  as well as notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
ratings nationally recognized ratings agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of lnc 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims  factors more relevant to policyholders than investors 
we believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized  independent rating agencies are material to our operations 
there may be other rating agencies that also rate our securities  which we do not disclose in our reports 
insurer financial strength ratings the insurer financial strength rating scales of am best  fitch ratings fitch  standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s are characterized as follows am best a to s fitch aaa to d moody s aaa to c s p aaa to r as of february   the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries  as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our securities  or us  are as follows a

a downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings 
debt ratings the long term credit rating scales of am best  fitch ratings  s p and moody s are characterized as follows am best aaa to d fitch aaa to d moody s aaa to c s p aaa to d as of february   our long term credit ratings  as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our long term credit  are as follows a

in addition  a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations  to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above 
all of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and therefore  no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or that lnc can maintain these ratings 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
regulatory general our insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are subject to regulation and supervision by the states  territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business 
the extent of such regulation varies  but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies 
in the united states  this power is vested in state insurance departments 
in supervising and regulating insurance companies  state insurance departments  charged primarily with protecting policyholders and the public rather than investors  enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose 
two of our principal insurance subsidiaries  lnl and first penn pacific life insurance company first penn  are domiciled in indiana  and the other  lincoln life annuity company of new york llany  is domiciled in new york 
the insurance departments of those states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over them 
the extent of regulation by the states varies  but in general  most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency  adequacy of reserves  reinsurance  capital adequacy  licensing of companies and agents to transact business  prescribing and approving policy forms  regulating premium rates for some lines of business  prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports  regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct 
as a result of being an accredited reinsurer in new york  lnl is also an authorized insurer in the state of new york 
as such  lnl is subject to the regulatory requirements imposed by new york on authorized insurers 
one such requirement is that lnl must report to new york its reserves based on new york reserving regulations  which are generally more conservative than those of indiana 
an example of this is on december   the new york state insurance department promulgated  as an emergency measure  amendments to its regulations governing the valuation of life insurance reserves for new york authorized insurers issuing certain life insurance policies 
specifically  the amendments apply to life insurance policies providing secondary guarantees  such as policies with our lpr as discussed above  that allow those policies to remain in force at the original schedule of benefits  even if the policy s cash value is depleted  as long as the contractual requirements to maintain the secondary guarantee are satisfied 
the amendments apply to policies issued on or after january  through july  we do not currently expect these changes to affect lnl s ability to continue as an authorized insurer in new york 
however  as discussed further below under restrictions on subsidiaries dividends and other payments  if new york requires us to maintain a higher level of capital to remain an authorized insurer in new york  these requirements may constrain lnl s ability to pay dividends to us 
state insurance departments in jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries do business conduct periodic examinations of their respective operations and accounts and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to their financial condition 
llany is currently undergoing a triennial examination by the new york state insurance department 
state insurance laws and regulations also include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers  including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers  illustrations  advertising  sales practices and complaint handling 
state regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations 
the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  however  federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry 
in june  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of egtrra was enacted 
egtrra contains provisions that will  over time  significantly lower individual tax rates 
this will have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the inside build up of annuities and life insurance products 
egtrra also includes provisions that will eliminate  over time  the estate  gift and generation skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent s estate 
some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products 
many of these provisions expire in  unless extended 
in may  the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of the act was enacted 
individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of the act  which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted originally under egtrra  as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions 
although most of these rate reductions expire after or later  these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build up of value of annuities and life insurance products 
like the egtrra changes  the act changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products 
on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of ajca 
among its various provisions  the ajca includes a provision that temporarily suspends current rules that impose an income tax on a stock life insurance company for distributions to its shareholders from its policyholder surplus account 
it also reverses the order in which distributions are charged against a company s various accounts  such that distributions will first be treated as coming from the policyholder surplus account and then the shareholders surplus account 
our dividend activity in and was sufficient to eliminate our insurance subsidiaries policyholder surplus accounts 
in addition  the ajca includes provisions affecting non qualified deferred compensation plans that may make such plans more complicated for employers depending on final tax rules and regulations 
because our coli products are often used to support such deferred compensation liabilities  the ajca may constrain sales of our coli products 
coli legislation has now passed in the senate and if such legislation is signed into law  it is expected to provide more certainty in the coli market  and therefore  is not expected to have a detrimental effect on coli markets in which we participate 
in february  bills were introduced in congress to provide tax incentives designed to encourage individuals to invest their after tax income in retirement vehicles  such as annuities  that provide guaranteed lifetime income 
under the proposal  individuals would not pay federal taxes on one half of the income generated by annuities that make lifetime payments up to an annual limit of  if this bill is enacted into law  we believe that it would have a favorable impact on our annuity business 
in february  the bush administration proposed that many of the temporary rate reductions from egtrra and the act be made permanent 
it continues to propose tax favored savings initiatives that  if enacted by congress  could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity  life and tax qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products 
however  we expect that the income for life guarantee provided within an annuity and features like our gmwb will continue to be viewed as significant benefits and may offset the adverse effect of these proposals 
in addition  lfa and lfd as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to regulation and supervision by the sec and the national association of securities dealers nasd 
our investment management segment  like other investment management groups  is subject to regulation and supervision by the sec  nasd  municipal securities rulemaking board msrb  the pennsylvania department of banking and jurisdictions of the states  territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business 
lincoln uk is subject to regulation by the financial services authority fsa in the uk some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor  in addition to being registered under the securities act of  are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of  and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the district of columbia 
we also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker dealers under the securities exchange act of exchange act and are subject to federal and state regulation  including but not limited to the nasd s net capital rules 
in addition  we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the investment advisers act of lfa s agents and our employees  insofar as they are involved in the sale or marketing of products that are securities  are subject to the exchange act and to examination requirements and regulation by the sec  the nasd and state securities commissioners 
regulation also extends to various lnc entities that employ or control those individuals 
the sec and other governmental agencies and self regulatory organizations  as well as state securities commissions in the united states  have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure  fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders or suspension  termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees 
federal and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual fund and variable annuity businesses 
as a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses  there have been numerous proposals for legislative and regulatory reforms  addressing issues which include  but are not limited to  the need for increased mutual fund governance and compliance practices  late trading  suitability of variable annuity products  directed brokerage and soft dollars  and new disclosure requirements concerning commission breakpoints  revenue sharing  shelf space  advisory fees  market timing  portfolio pricing  information about portfolio managers and other issues 
it is difficult to predict at this time whether changes resulting from new laws and regulations will affect the industries or our asset management businesses  and  if so  to what degree 
insurance holding company regulation lnc and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of indiana and new york 
these insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company s system to register with the insurance department authorities  to file with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital structure  ownership  management  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions  including material transfers of assets and intercompany business agreements  and to report material changes in that information 
these laws also require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and  under certain circumstances  prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an intercompany transaction 
further  these laws require that an insurer s policyholders surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs 
in general  under state holding company regulations  no person may acquire  directly or indirectly  a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person  corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control 
pursuant to such laws  in general  any person acquiring  controlling or holding the power to vote  directly or indirectly  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company  is presumed to have control of such company 
this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact 
the insurance commissioner  however  may find that control exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities 
to obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company  the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the nature  source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition  the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates  any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer  the number and type of securities to be acquired  any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired  any agreements with broker dealers  and other matters 
other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions 
additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control 
as further described below  laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries 
restrictions on subsidiaries dividends and other payments we are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company 
under indiana laws and regulations  our indiana insurance subsidiaries  including our primary insurance subsidiary  lnl  may pay dividends to lnc only from unassigned surplus  without prior approval of the indiana insurance commissioner the commissioner  or must receive prior approval of the commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend  along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months  would exceed the statutory limitation 
the current statutory limitation is the greater of i of the insurer s policyholders surplus  as shown on its last annual statement on file with the commissioner or ii the insurer s statutory net gain from operations for the previous twelve months  but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus 
indiana law gives commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend  the insurer s policyholders surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs  and permits the indiana insurance commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards 
in the event that the indiana insurance commissioner determines that the policyholders surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate  the commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary 
for information regarding dividends paid to us during from our insurance subsidiaries  see review of consolidated financial condition sources of liquidity and cash flow in our md a 
as stated above  lnl is also an authorized insurer in the state of new york 
as a result  it is also subject to the regulatory requirements that the state of new york imposes upon authorized insurers 
these regulations include reserve requirements  which differ from indiana s requirements 
the new york regulations require lnl to report more reserves to the state of new york 
as a result  the level of statutory surplus that lnl reports to new york is less than the statutory surplus reported to indiana and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
if new york requires us to maintain a higher level of capital to remain an authorized insurer in new york  lnl s ability to pay dividends to lnc could be constrained 
however  we do not expect the new york reserve requirements to constrain lnl s ability to pay dividends during for further information on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  see review of consolidated financial condition sources of liquidity and cash flow in the md a 
lincoln uk s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the uk fsa and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the uk capital resources requirement formerly the required minimum solvency margin 
lincoln uk targets maintaining approximately to times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory resource requirement 
effective january   all insurance companies operating in the uk also have to complete a risk based capital rbc assessment to demonstrate to the fsa that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks 
rbc requirements in the uk are different than the naic requirements 
in addition  the fsa imposes certain minimum capital requirements for the combined uk subsidiaries 
as is the case with regulated insurance companies in the us  future changes to regulatory capital requirements could impact the dividend capacity of our uk insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company 
risk based capital the naic has adopted risk based capital requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks 
the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile 
there are five major risks involved in determining the requirements 
category name description asset risk affiliates c risk of assets default for certain affiliated investments asset risk other c risk of assets default of principal and interest or fluctuation in fair value insurance risk c risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the future interest rate risk  health credit risk and market risk c risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels  risk of loss due to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guarantees  and certain health insurers risks not applicable to our operations business risk c risk of general business a company s risk based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset  premium  claim  expense and reserve items 
regulators can then measure adequacy of a company s statutory surplus by comparing it to the risk based capital determined by the formula 
under rbc requirements  regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its company action level of rbc known as the rbc ratio  also as defined by the naic 
four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the rbc ratio is insufficient company action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake 
regulatory action level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the insurer must submit a plan  but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period 
authorized control level if the rbc ratio is between and  then the regulatory response is the same as at the regulatory action level  but in addition  the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
mandatory control level if the rbc ratio is less than  then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc ratios of lnl  first penn and llany reported to their respective states of domicile and the naic were  and  respectively 
we believe that we will be able to maintain the rbc ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of company action level through prudent underwriting  claims handling  investing and capital management 
however  no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries  many of which could be outside of our control  including but not limited to changes in the regulatory environment  including changes to the manner in which the rbc ratio is calculated  economic conditions and competitive conditions in the jurisdictions in which we write business  will not cause the rbc ratios to fall below required levels resulting in a corresponding regulatory response 
the naic and the life and health actuarial task force adopted in new requirements for calculating the rbc in connection with variable annuity products with death and living benefit guarantees c phase 
the new c phase requirements are effective as of december  and include transition rules where the rbc amount for these products are the sum of multiplied by the c phase calculated amount and multiplied by the previous rbc amount held for these products 
the rbc ratios shown above for lnl  first penn and llany include the effect of the c phase calculation where appropriate 
under c phase testing  a component of rbc for fixed annuity policies is determined using projections of the business under various interest rate scenarios instead of a prescribed factor 
if the business is significant as measured by specific tests required by the naic  then the c phase testing is required 
if the business is not significant  then the prescribed factor may be used 
the naic currently allows companies to elect to perform c phase testing even if not required to perform the calculation 
companies making the c phase election are required to do the testing in future years and cannot return to the prescribed factor approach 
in calculating its rbc  lnl has elected to perform c phase testing 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
in that case  the value of our securities could decline substantially 
for additional risks concerning our previously announced merger with jefferson pilot  see amendment no 
to our form s registration no 
risk factors in connection with our business our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate 
our reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate 
we establish and carry  as a liability  reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims 
for our life insurance and annuity products  we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates  including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy  the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy  the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive 
the assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for  or the timing of payment of  actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims 
if our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates  our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims 
as a result  we would incur a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves 
because the equity markets and interest rates impact our profitability  changes in equity markets and interest rates may also negatively affect our business and profitability 
the fee revenue that we earn on equity based variable annuities  unit linked accounts  variable universal life insurance policies and investment advisory business  is based upon account values 
because strong equity markets result in higher account values  strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee revenue 
in addition  the increased fee revenue resulting from strong equity markets increases the expected gross profits egps from variable insurance products 
as a result  the higher egps may result in lower net amortized costs related to deferred acquisition costs dac  deferred sales inducements dsi  the present value of in force business pvif  and deferred front end sales loads dfel associated with those products 
for more information on dac  dsi  pvif and dfel amortization  see critical accounting policies in the md a 
finally  the amount of reserves related to the gmdb for variable annuities is tied to the difference between the value of the underlying accounts and the guaranteed death benefit  which is a benefit ratio present value of total expected gmdb payments over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract 
both the level of expected gmdb payments and expected total assessments used in calculating this benefit ratio are affected by the equity markets 
accordingly  strong equity markets will decrease the amount of gmdb reserves that we must carry 
conversely  a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and  depending upon the significance of the drop in the equity markets  may result in higher net expenses associated with dac  dsi  pvif and dfel 
both lower fee income and higher net expenses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources 
furthermore  a decrease in the equity markets will increase the net amount at risk under the gmdb benefits we offer as part of our variable annuity products  which has the effect of increasing the amount of gmdb reserves that we must carry 
as a result  if such reserves are not reasonable in relation to our expected liabilities for gmdb  it would likely result in an increase in gmdb payments and would result in a decrease in the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract 
the result would be an increase the level of the gmdb reserves 
such an increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves to bring them within a reasonable range of our estimated future liabilities related to the gmdb guarantees 
because the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest sensitive whole life  universal life and fixed portion of variable universal life insurance business depends in part on interest rate spreads  interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability 
jefferson pilot also offers products the profitability of which depends in part on interest rate spreads 
accordingly  our merger with jefferson pilot may exacerbate this risk 
changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital 
some of our products  principally fixed annuities and interest sensitive whole life  universal life and the fixed portion of variable universal life insurance  expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our spread  or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts 
declines in our spread from these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations 
in periods of increasing interest rates  we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest sensitive products competitive 
we therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets 
in periods of declining interest rates  we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then available 
moreover  borrowers may prepay fixed income securities  commercial mortgages and mortgage backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbates this risk 
because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited  pre established intervals  and since many of our policies have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates  our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative 
increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products 
in periods of increasing interest rates  policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns 
this process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses 
these outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
a sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds 
in addition  unanticipated withdrawals and terminations also may require us to accelerate dac  dsi  pvif and dfel amortization 
this would increase our current expenses 
a downgrade in our claims paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products  increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and or hurt our relationships with creditors 
nationally recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of lnc 
ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities 
please see ratings beginning on page for a complete description of our ratings 
our claims paying ratings  which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations  are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and  as a result  our competitiveness 
the interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically  and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future 
a downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings 
this could lead to a decrease in fees as outflows of assets increase  and therefore  result in lower fee income 
furthermore  sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses  depending on market conditions 
a downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt  and accordingly  likely increase our cost of capital 
in addition  a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations  to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above 
a drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage as well as a loss of key portfolio managers could result in lower advisory fees 
while mutual funds are not rated  per se  many industry periodicals and services  such as lipper  provide rankings of mutual fund performance 
under investment management  we have disclosed the number of our largest retail mutual funds based on assets under management  as well as all of our retail mutual funds  that rank in the top half of their lipper category for the one  three and five year periods ended december  these rankings often have an impact on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in 
if the rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease materially  the funds assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with higher performance rankings 
similarly  a loss of our key portfolio managers who manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance  as well as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the portfolio managers 
any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees that we earn from such mutual funds  which are generally tied to the amount of fund assets and performance 
this would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business 
the supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance policyholders  and not our investors 
the extent of regulation varies  but generally is governed by state statutes 
these statutes delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 
this system of supervision and regulation covers  among other things standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay  the existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  and assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
the regulations of the state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand for our products and may impede us from taking actions we might wish to take to increase our profitability 
for example  in july  a committee of the naic adopted a change to actuarial guideline also known as axxx  the statutory reserve requirements for ul products with secondary guarantees  such as lnl s lpr product 
this proposal was formally adopted by the naic in with an effective date of july  the proposal does not affect business written prior to the effective date of july  we continue to evaluate potential modifications to our universal life products with secondary guarantees that may be made in response to the revised regulation 
although the impact of this proposal on future sales of guaranteed no lapse ul cannot be predicted  it may result in a price increase for such products  and therefore  may lower sales of such products 
further  we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations  which may change from time to time 
also  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines 
further  insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision  which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company 
as of december   no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  lfa and lfd as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to regulation and supervision by the sec and the nasd 
our investment management segment  like other investment management groups  is subject to regulation and supervision by the sec  nasd  msrb  the pennsylvania department of banking and jurisdictions of the states  territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business 
lincoln uk is subject to regulation by the fsa in the uk these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self regulatory organizations broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations 
many of the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees 
in recent years  there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies  which has included more extensive examinations  regular sweep inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents 
these regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if  in their view  our practices  or those of our agents or employees  are improper 
these actions can result in substantial fines  penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for further information on regulatory matters relating to us  see regulatory matters above 
legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses 
there continues to be a significant amount of federal and state regulatory activity in the industry relating to numerous issues including  but not limited to  market timing and late trading of mutual fund and variable insurance products and broker dealer access arrangements 
like others in the industry  we have received inquiries including requests for information and or subpoenas from various authorities including the sec  the nasd and the new york attorney general  as well as notices of potential proceedings from the sec and nasd 
we are in the process of responding to  and in some cases have settled or are in the process of settling  certain of these inquiries and potential proceedings 
we continue to cooperate fully with such authorities 
in addition  we are  and in the future may be  subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and investment management operations  both domestically and internationally 
pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us  and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate 
some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants 
in certain of these matters  the plaintiffs are seeking large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive or exemplary damages 
substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation  which in turn could materially harm our business prospects 
changes in federal income tax law could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs 
egtrra as well as the act contain provisions that will  over time  significantly lower individual tax rates 
this will have the effect of reducing the benefits of deferral on the build up of value of annuities and life insurance products 
egtrra also includes provisions that will eliminate  over time  the estate  gift and generation skipping taxes and partially eliminate the step up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent s estate 
many of these provisions expire in and  unless extended 
the bush administration continues to propose that many of the foregoing rate reductions be made permanent  as well as several tax favored savings initiatives  such as the elimination of the estate tax  that  if enacted by congress  could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity  life and tax qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products 
although we cannot predict the overall effect on the sales of our products of the tax law changes included in these acts  some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance products 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures to identify  monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective 
many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate  such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths 
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients  catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us  which may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
management of operational  legal and regulatory risks requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events  and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
because we are a holding company with no direct operations  the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future dividends 
we are a holding company  and we have no direct operations 
our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance and investment management subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
changes in these laws  such as new york state amendments to its statutory reserve requirements  can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses 
we face a risk of non collectibility of reinsurance  which could materially affect our results of operations 
we follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries known as ceding 
at the end of  we have ceded approximately billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection 
although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay policyholders for losses insured under the policies we issue  reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
as of december   we had billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses  for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts 
of this amount  billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance business to swiss re in through an indemnity reinsurance agreement 
during  swiss re funded a trust to support this business 
the balance in the trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was billion at december  in addition  should swiss re life health america inc srlha financial strength ratings drop below either s p aa or am best a or their naic risk based capital ratio fall below  assets equal to the reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according to pre established asset quality guidelines 
furthermore  approximately billion of the swiss re treaties are funds withheld structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables 
the balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers 
the collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers 
we perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial capacity  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
we also require assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions 
despite these measures  a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract  especially swiss re  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
significant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of  or higher prices for  reinsurance 
we reinsure approximately to of the mortality risk on fully underwritten newly issued life insurance contracts 
our current policy is to retain no more than million on a single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance contracts 
additionally  the retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for corporate owned life insurance coli is million and million  respectively 
beginning in september  we changed our reinsurance program for our primary term products from coinsurance to renewable term and from to on a first dollar quota share basis 
in january  we changed this program from first dollar quota share to an excess of retention program 
in a coinsurance program  the reinsurer shares proportionately in all financial terms of the reinsured policies  ie premiums  expenses  claims  etc 
based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in a renewable term program  the reinsurer is paid a renewable term premium to cover the proportionate share of mortality risk assumed by the reinsurer 
in a first dollar quota share program  the reinsurer receives a proportionate share of all risks issued based on their respective quota share of the risk 
in an excess of retention program  the reinsurer assumes a proportionate share of risks that exceed our per life retention 
these retention limits are reviewed regularly for continued appropriateness and may be changed in the future 
if we were to experience adverse mortality experience  a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers 
prolonged or severe adverse mortality experience could result in increased reinsurance costs and ultimately  reinsurers not willing to offer coverage 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient  we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums 
if this were to occur  we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates 
we may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees  particularly financial advisors 
we compete to attract and retain financial advisors  portfolio managers and other employees  as well as independent distributors of our products 
intense competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated ability 
we compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products  compensation  support services and financial position 
sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining financial advisors  portfolio managers and other employees  as well as independent distributors of our products 
for example  in  we changed the compensation structure for lfa s financial advisors 
although we believe the new compensation structure will benefit us  our policyholders and our planners  if a significant number of financial advisors terminate their affiliation with us  it could have a negative impact on our sales and ability to retain existing in force business 
during  the number of new planners recruited to lfa was down relative to prior years  which is partially a result of lfa focusing more on recruiting experienced planners than in it had in prior years 
our sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors 
we sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives 
these representatives are not captive  which means they may also sell our competitors products 
if our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours  or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do  these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors products instead of ours 
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 
our businesses are intensely competitive 
we compete based on a number of factors including name recognition  service  the quality of investment advice  investment performance  product features  price  perceived financial strength  and claims paying and credit ratings 
our competitors include insurers  broker dealers  financial advisors  asset managers and other financial institutions 
a number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share  offer a broader range of products or have higher claims paying or credit ratings than we do 
in recent years  there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large  well capitalized financial services firms 
many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements 
furthermore  larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings  thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively 
we expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future  thereby increasing competitive pressure on us 
losses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments 
third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets may not pay or perform their obligations 
these parties include the issuers whose securities we hold  borrowers under the mortgage loans we make  customers  trading counterparties  counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts  reinsurers and other financial intermediaries 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  downturns in the economy or real estate values  operational failure  corporate governance issues or other reasons 
a downturn in the us and other economies could result in increased impairments 
anti takeover provisions could delay  deter or prevent our change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to lnc shareholders 
we are an indiana corporation subject to indiana state law 
certain provisions of indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
also  provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and other agreements to which we are a party could delay  deter or prevent our change in control  even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  under indiana law  directors may  in considering the best interests of a corporation  consider the effects of any action on stockholders  employees  suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located  and other factors the directors consider pertinent 
one statutory provision prohibits  except under specified circumstances  lnc from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock which shareholder  under the statute  would be considered an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless such business combination is approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder 
in addition  our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders of at least three fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors  voting together  to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under indiana law 
in addition to the anti takeover provisions of indiana law  there are other factors that may delay  deter or prevent our change in control 
as an insurance holding company  we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled 
the insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval 
under those statutes and regulations  without such approval or an exemption  no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company  or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company  or merge with such a holding company  if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company or insurance company 
control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls or more of the voting securities of another person 
risk factors in connection with the jefferson pilot merger the announcement and pendency of the merger with jefferson pilot  whether or not the merger is completed  could cause disruptions in our and jefferson pilot s businesses  which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
whether or not the merger is completed  the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our and jefferson pilot s businesses 
specifically current and prospective employees and agents may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the resulting company  which might adversely affect our and jefferson pilot s ability to retain key managers and other employees and agents  and the attention of our and jefferson pilot s management may be directed toward the completion of the merger and not their ongoing businesses 
the merger is subject to certain closing conditions that  if not satisfied or waived  will result in the merger not being completed  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the merger is subject to customary conditions to closing  including the receipt of required regulatory approvals and approvals of our and jefferson pilot s shareholders 
if any condition to the merger is not satisfied or waived  to the extent permitted by law or stock exchange rule  the merger will not be completed 
in addition  we and jefferson pilot may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances 
if we and jefferson pilot do not complete the merger  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate to the extent that the current market prices of those shares reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed 
further  whether or not the merger is completed  we will also be obligated to pay certain investment banking  financing  legal and accounting fees and related expenses in connection with the merger  which could negatively impact results of operations when incurred 
in addition  neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger 
if the merger is not completed  we cannot assure our shareholders that additional risks will not materialize or not materially adversely affect our business  financial results  financial condition and stock prices 
the anticipated benefits of combining jefferson pilot and us may not be realized 
we and jefferson pilot entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits including  among other things  benefits relating to enhanced revenues  a strengthened market position for the resulting company in its businesses  cross selling opportunities  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties  including whether we and jefferson pilot are integrated in an efficient and effective manner  and general competitive factors in the marketplace 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy and could materially impact the resulting company s business  financial condition and operating results 
we may have difficulty integrating jefferson pilot and may incur substantial costs in connection with the integration 
we may experience material unanticipated difficulties or expenses in connection with integrating jefferson pilot  especially given the relatively large size of the merger 
integrating jefferson pilot with us will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
before the merger  we and jefferson pilot operated independently  each with its own business  products  customers  employees  culture and systems 
we may face substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating jefferson pilot 
these factors may include perceived adverse changes in product offerings available to clients or client service standards  whether or not these changes do  in fact  occur  conditions imposed by regulators in connection with their decisions whether to approve the merger  potential charges to earnings resulting from the application of purchase accounting to the transaction  the retention of existing clients  key portfolio managers  sales representatives and wholesalers of each company  and retaining and integrating management and other key employees of the resulting company 
after the merger  we may seek to combine certain operations and functions using common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resource practices  including training  professional development and benefit programs 
we may be unsuccessful or delayed in implementing the integration of these systems and processes 
any one or all of these factors may cause increased operating costs  worse than anticipated financial performance or the loss of clients  employees and agents 
many of these factors are outside our control
