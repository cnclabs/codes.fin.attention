item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview performance our overall strategy for fiscal was to continue our focus on improving gross margins on our products through achieving continued benefits from strategies implemented in fiscal year  as well as through the implementation of new strategies 
our gross margin increased to for fiscal year from achieved in fiscal year and achieved in fiscal the increase in revenue and a improvement in overall gross margin during the year ended may   as compared to the prior year period  were due to several factors  including reagent price increases  attributable in part to the cancellation in january of supply agreements with two group purchasing organizations which annually contributed approximately million to our revenues  in order to increase member purchasing prices as well as reduce administrative fees associated with these contracts  increased capture reagent revenues  driven primarily by the kit to component marketing changeover implemented in the third quarter of fiscal  as well as placement of additional instruments which require the use of capture reagents  and increased manufacturing efficiencies due in part to the continued elimination of a number of redundant products previously manufactured at our three manufacturing facilities 
our reporting of revenue and gross margins is affected by the application of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the accounting treatment mandated by this pronouncement resulted in the deferral of certain revenue for sales agreements which had multiple deliverables 
as of may  and may   we had deferred revenue liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  and a significant portion of these balances related to the deferral of revenue from sale of instruments 
we were again successful in containing operating expenses which rose by only to million 
net income increased to million  or  compared to prior year 
increased revenue  improved gross margin and control of expenses contributed to our achieving a record year in terms of revenue and net income 
acquisition in japan on july   in an effort to expand our presence in japan  we acquired immucor kainos  inc a newly formed company to which kainos laboratories  inc kainos  our former distributor of immucor products in japan  spun off its blood banking division 
we paid kainos million approximately million in cash on signing of the purchase agreements  and will pay an additional million approximately million over three years with minimum payments of million in each of the first two years and the remaining million in the third year 
a final payment of million will be made after a three year transition period ending on june   or earlier upon mutual agreement 
kainos has agreed to provide certain services to us during the first three years 
we believe the acquisition of this business is a key step towards further penetrating the japanese transfusion diagnostics market  the third largest such market in the world after europe and the united states 
business outlook for fiscal  we are continuing to focus on improving gross margins through achieving continued benefits from successful strategies already implemented  as well as through the implementation of new strategies 
listed below are the key factors which we expect will drive further revenue and gross margin improvements in fiscal expanding customer base of our customer loyalty program we continue to offer this program to expand reagent utilization throughout our customer base 
first implemented in fiscal  the program promotes partnering with the customer to standardize blood bank products 
the program promotes higher sales volumes while partially shielding our more loyal customers from the effects of price increases 
impact of galileo increased market penetration we expect capture revenues to increase in fiscal over fiscal  due to the continued impact of fiscal galileo placements as well as expected new placements in fiscal as of may   we have received purchase orders for galileo instruments from european customers since introducing the galileo to the european market in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  as of may  galileo instruments purchase orders have been received from us customers since fda clearance was received in april  galileo purchase orders have been received from canadian customers since health canada clearance was received in july  and two purchase orders have been received from japanese customers since ministry of health clearance was received in july as of may   of these instruments were generating reagent revenues 
increased japanese market penetration we believe the acquisition of immucor kainos is a key step towards further penetrating the japanese transfusion diagnostics market  the third largest such market in the world after europe and the united states 
the results of this subsidiary have been included in our consolidated financial statements from july   the date of acquisition 
introduction of galileo echo we expect to further improve our competitive position going into fiscal through the launch of our third generation automated assay instrument  the galileo echo  which is expected to be released in european and us markets in the third quarter of fiscal the actual launch date is dependent on fda clearance of the instrument in the united states and assumes clearance will take approximately days after the submission is received by the fda 
galileo echo is significantly smaller and faster than our abs  and has substantially all of the features of our larger instrument  galileo  apart from lower throughput 
we believe the galileo echo will appeal to the small to medium sized hospital market  the largest segment of our customers approximately  to  worldwide  to which our abs instrument is currently marketed 
increased manufacturing efficiencies we believe the following decisions and steps will further increase efficiencies in our manufacturing operations and help us in containing our expenses i we will continue eliminating redundant products currently manufactured at the company s three manufacturing facilities 
ii we will continue increasing manufacturing efficiencies going into fiscal through implementation of a manufacturing execution system mes  a new sales forecasting system  and a new marketing database  the combination of which is expected to drive more accurate forecasting of product demand and resulting material and labor requirements 
the new marketing database was implemented in june and the new sales forecasting system was implemented in january mes preliminary design work will commence in fiscal and is expected to be implemented in fiscal iii our decision to consolidate manufacturing operations in norcross  georgia and close the houston  texas facility by december will further reduce overheads and improve margins and net income 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended may   net sales totaled million  up from the prior year net sales of million 
net income was up  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal diluted earnings per share totaled for fiscal  as compared to diluted earnings per share of for the prior year  an increase of 
since the acquisition of immucor japan on july   immucor japan is reflected in our results of operations for eleven months of fiscal it contributed million to revenue and incurred loss from operations of million in fiscal united states operations continue to generate a majority of our revenue and operating income 
us operations generated and  respectively  of our revenue and operating income in fiscal compared to and  respectively  in fiscal year comparison of years ended may  and may  year ended may  change in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative restructuring expenses n m amortization expense and other total operating expenses other income income before income tax provision for income tax net income net sales traditional reagent revenues grew to million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
the growth in traditional reagent revenue ie products not utilizing our patented capture technology occurred mainly as a result of price increases  the effect of which was marginally offset approximately million by a slight decrease in sales volume in the united states 
traditional reagent sales have historically been our primary source of revenue and still constitute a very significant portion of our business 
we expect the significance of this line of products to decline as we place more instruments in the market and increase sales of our capture products 
capture product sales were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
the increase is primarily attributable to the change of marketing strategy in january from selling products in kits to selling individual components and to price increases 
sales of capture products are largely dependent on the number of active instruments requiring the use of capture reagents placed with customers and in operation 
as we succeed in placing more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture products to increase 
sales of instruments were million in fiscal and fiscal most instrument sales in the united states are recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract  which is normally five years 
in fiscal approximately million of instrument sales and associated service revenue were deferred in this manner  compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
as of may  and may   deferred instrument and service revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
revenue recognized from instrument sales and associated service revenue was approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a increase 
we expect to put more galileo instruments in the market and also expect to begin generating revenues from the sale of our new galileo echo instruments which we expect to launch in the us and europe in the third quarter of fiscal the actual launch date is dependent on fda clearance of the instrument in the united states and assumes clearance will take approximately days after the submission is received by the fda 
we expect to recognize more revenue in the coming years as we place more instruments in the market and also recognize the revenue which we have been deferring 
human collagen forms a very small part of our business  and sales of this product line were million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to the prior year 
gross margin overall gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved during fiscal to  up from in fiscal gross margin of on traditional reagents for fiscal was higher than the achieved in the prior year  primarily due to benefits from higher prices and manufacturing efficiencies 
the gross margin on capture products improved slightly to from achieved in the prior year 
in the case of instruments  comparing gross margin percentages from period to period can be misleading because of the way revenue and cost for certain types of instrument sales are recorded 
where sales contracts have price guarantee clauses  instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made  but the related revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the agreement 
for fiscal  the gross margin on instruments was a negative and for fiscal it was a negative 
in fiscal  we recorded more cost from sales of instruments but the growth in revenue recognized was at a slower rate 
this resulted in negative gross margin increasing to from in fiscal the gross margin on human collagen sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to an increase in costs 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million higher than those recorded in the prior fiscal year 
as we reached the final phase of the development of the galileo echo  the new third generation instrument targeted for the small to medium sized hospital market  the spending on this project decreased to million in fiscal from million spent in fiscal cost incurred on other projects accounted for a net increase of million in the research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately million to million  or over the prior fiscal year 
the japanese affiliate  which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal  added million to selling and marketing expenses in the current fiscal year 
distribution expenses for fiscal were million which was marginally less than the amount incurred in the prior fiscal year 
the japanese affiliate added million to distribution expenses in the current fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal rose million  or  to million over fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to sarbanes oxley compliance million  hiring of new personnel million and severance cost million 
the japanese affiliate added million to general and administration expenses in the current fiscal year 
our decision to consolidate our manufacturing operations in norcross  georgia resulted in restructuring charges of million in the fiscal year of the total charge of million  million was for the impairment of long lived assets at the houston  texas facility 
there were no significant changes in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal to the total estimated cost and initial charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal no restructuring charges were recorded in fiscal year income taxes the provision for income taxes rose million in fiscal from the prior year  primarily due to higher pre tax income with the overall effective tax rate for fiscal and remaining at 
deferred tax assets pertaining to operating loss carry forwards increased by approximately million  of which approximately million related to our foreign affiliates a major portion of it relating to the european restructure and to the operating loss incurred by the japanese affiliate acquired in fiscal and approximately million was for state operating losses relating to unwinding of the state and local tax structure implemented in it is more likely than not that these tax losses will not be utilized and as a result we have recorded deferred tax valuation allowances against these assets 
this is reflected in an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowances of million 
as a result of utilizing compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options for federal and state income tax purposes  we realized income tax benefits of approximately million in fiscal and fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  these income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as additions to additional paid in capital rather than as reductions of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated income statement because the related compensation deductions are not recognized as compensation expense for financial reporting purposes 
our income tax liability is reduced by these amounts 
comparison of years ended may  and may  year ended may  change in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative amortization expense and other total operating expenses other income loss n m income before income tax provision for income tax net income net sales reagent revenues grew to million compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
the growth in reagent revenues occurred as a result of traditional reagent price increases in north america  which contributed million to the increase  and volume and price increases in proprietary capture products 
capture product sales were million versus million in fiscal human collagen sales were million versus million in fiscal  as the first shipment of collagen did not occur until may sales of instruments were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal instrument revenues grew in part due to higher service contract revenue as a result of new placements under service contracts  as well as increases in service contract pricing 
gross margin the gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales on traditional reagents for the year ended may  benefited from the price increases discussed above  increasing to for fiscal from for fiscal the benefit of the prices increases was partially offset by higher regulatory costs in the first quarter of fiscal to support ce marking in europe 
the gross margin on capture products was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal capture gross margin was favorably impacted by a changeover from selling the products in kits to selling the individual components an operational change which resulted in increases in both volume and price 
the gross margin on human collagen sales was for fiscal  compared with for fiscal this improvement was due in part to a fourth quarter fiscal adjustment totaling approximately million regarding previously invoiced shipments for which quantity discounts were not earned 
the gross margin on instruments  including the impact of the cost of providing service was a negative for fiscal  compared to a positive for fiscal in the quarter ended february   the company also changed how it was accounting for the costs of instruments under third party leasing arrangements and  as a result  recorded additional cost of sales of approximately  operating expenses research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million higher than those recorded in the prior fiscal year 
spending on the development of the galileo echo was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased million over the prior fiscal year  but decreased as a percentage of sales 
this decrease as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher period over period sales as discussed more fully above 
distribution expenses for fiscal decreased by million from those recorded in the prior year period 
this reduction was due primarily to the consolidation of the houston facility shipping function into the norcross facility  a process which was begun during the fourth quarter of fiscal and completed in the first quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal rose million over fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to higher legal fees due mainly to the italian investigation as well as higher audit and tax fees  due in part to the sarbanes oxley section internal control assessment 
other income expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal primarily as a result of reduced levels of long term debt 
other income  net  for fiscal year  primarily reflects a million gain on the sale of the company s long term investment in lionheart technologies  inc in november  as well as a net gain on foreign currency transactions 
these gains were partially offset by a million charge representing a legal settlement agreed upon in december regarding a pre existing claim and a million charge associated with the buyout of a distribution agreement in the first quarter of fiscal other expense income  net  for fiscal  reflects a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal to write off unamortized deferred financing charges related to the company s previous credit facility 
income taxes the provision for income taxes rose million in fiscal from the prior year  primarily due to higher pre tax income 
state tax rates are estimated to be higher as the company refines its state tax structure 
the increase in the provision for the year was partially offset by a benefit for a research and development tax credit for the current fiscal year as well as the prior three fiscal years 
this credit totaled approximately  on which the company provided a reserve based on historical settlement claims of similar cases with the internal revenue service 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash from operations 
we have adequate working capital and sources of capital to carry on our current business and to meet our existing capital requirements 
at may   we had working capital of million  compared to million of working capital at may  the following chart shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal years  and  as well as the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents for those same years for the year ended may  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents were million at may   as compared to million at may  in fiscal  we paid million for the purchase of immucor kainos  repaid million of long term debt and capital leases and spent million to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan 
these significant and non recurring payments were more than compensated for by million in cash generated through operating activities for fiscal  resulting in net improvement of million in cash and cash equivalents balances 
as of may   the company s cash and cash equivalents balances totaled million  an increase of million over fiscal these increases were driven by higher net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million and million for the fiscal years and  respectively 
operating activities net cash generated by operating activities was million for the year ended may   a million increase over the million generated in the year ended may  this increase was primarily driven by a million  or  increase in net income  adjusted for non cash income statement items  in fiscal compared to fiscal positive movement in certain components of working capital further improved the cash generated from operating activities  significantly  an increase in deferred revenue contributed million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal a significant portion of our instrument sales revenue is deferred and  as of may   we had approximately million of deferred revenues compared to million at may  cash from operating activities is affected by the level of instrument sales activity for which revenue is deferred 
a significant increase in instrument sales with deferred revenue tends to have a positive effect on the cash position even though revenue is not recorded in the same accounting period  and a significant decrease in such sales would have the opposite effect on the cash position 
another major factor in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was the improved management of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable  additional capital required for these components of working capital during fiscal was million compared to million increase in fiscal investing activities in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities primarily for the acquisition of immucor kainos  inc million and capital expenditures million 
the million in capital expenditures for fiscal consisted primarily of million for instruments used for demonstration purposes or placed at customer sites on reagent rental agreements  million for building  machinery and equipment and furniture additions and upgrades  and million for computer hardware and software enhancements and replacements 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal total approximately million  including approximately million for upgrades of manufacturing  quality and support systems  approximately million for instruments  approximately million for building renovations  and approximately million in computer hardware and software expenditures for infrastructure upgrades 
in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities consisting primarily of capital expenditures totaling million and investments in marketable debt securities totaling million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of our long term investment in lionheart technologies  inc the million in capital expenditures for the year ended may  consisted primarily of million for instruments  million for machinery and equipment upgrades for use primarily at the company s norcross facility  and million for computer hardware and software enhancements of the enterprise software system 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  we utilized million to repurchase shares of our common stock  compared to million we spent in fiscal we had a cash outlay of million in fiscal to pay off all of our long term debt and capital leases 
in fiscal  we repaid million of our long term debt 
our cash position and cash generated by operations allowed us to repay all capital lease obligations and long term borrowings from financial institutions 
we received million and million from the exercise of employee stock options in fiscal and  respectively 
stock repurchase program during the year ended may   we repurchased  shares at an average share price of 
during the fiscal year ended may   the total amount spent for the shares bought under this program amounted to million  compared to million spent during the fiscal year ended may  an aggregate of  shares were available for repurchase under the program as of may  contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities  when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we currently are involved in certain legal proceedings 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
contingent liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future cash requirements and restrictions in july  we paid kainos million approximately million in cash on signing of the purchase agreements  and are required to pay an additional million approximately million over three years with minimum payments of million in each of the first two years and the remaining million in the third year 
as of may   we have paid million of this liability 
in addition  a final payment of million will be made after a three year transition period ending on june   or earlier upon mutual agreement 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support operations and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
we have no long term debt except the acquisition liability for the purchase of immucor kainos 
there are no restrictions on our foreign subsidiaries in the matter of sending dividends  or making loans or advances to the parent company 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments  primarily for the next five years  are detailed in the table below contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt and lines of credit capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations includes outstanding purchase commitments and commitments to celliance  ltd 
and bio tek instruments  inc as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents japan acquisition liability 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of may  critical accounting policies general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and certain assumptions could prove to be incorrect 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
reagent sales revenue from the sale of our reagents to end users is recognized upon shipment when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon shipment  unless there are specific contractual terms to the contrary 
revenue from the sale of our reagents to distributors is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
medical instrument sales revenue from the sale of our medical instruments is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations 
revenue from rentals of our medical instruments is recognized over the term of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the term of the contract 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recognize revenue on the sale of medical instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our medical instrument sales contracts involve multiple deliverables  including the sale or rental of an instrument including delivery  installation and training  the servicing of the instrument during the first year  and  in some cases  price guarantees for consumables purchased during the contract period and or providing a software interface 
we have determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training and first year service 
the portion of the instrument sales price applicable to the instrument itself is recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation based on the related contractual specifications 
if the agreement does not include any price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training and service is allocated to the instrument itself 
the fair value of a training session is recognized as revenue when services are provided 
if multiple sessions are contractually provided for  and not all training has been completed at the time the instrument is recognized  additional training revenue is recognized upon delivery 
the fair value of first year service is deferred and recognized over the first year of the contract 
if the agreement contains price guarantees  the entire sales price is deferred and recognized over the related guarantee period due to the fair value of the price guarantee not being determinable at that time 
the allocation of the total consideration received  which is based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting  requires judgment by management 
sales subject to a plan of factoring sales subject to a plan of factoring are recorded at net realizable value defined as gross sales less the annual estimated cost of factoring the sale 
should the factored sale remain uncollected by the factor at the end of one year  an estimate of the additional factoring discount is made and recorded monthly as an additional reduction of sales revenue 
trade accounts receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables at may   totaling million  and at may   totaling million  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their debts 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we use a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and such variances are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are made to the standard rates to approximate actual costs 
the provision for obsolete and or excess inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis or  if warranted by circumstances  more frequently 
in evaluating this reserve  management considers technology changes  competition  customer demand  product shelf life and manufacturing quality 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal  or goodwill on adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets that have finite lives are continuing to be amortized over their useful lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment losses 
income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we also evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
no material changes have been made to the income tax policy during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based employee compensation for the fiscal year ended may  and prior periods  we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the stock option grants 
we usually granted stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant 
however  beginning in fiscal  we began awarding grants to eligible new hires with the respective exercise price equal to the closing price on the business day immediately prior to the grant date  therefore in these cases  the exercise price may be higher or lower than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
management has determined that the aggregate difference between the grant date fair values and the exercise prices for grants awarded to new hires is not material approximately  in total for the grants issued below market price in fiscal  and accordingly has not included any such compensation cost related to these grants in the company s results of operations 
under our long term incentive plan  options are granted to eligible new hires with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the first day of employment 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
in the period ended may  this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement r 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
alternative phase in methods are allowed under statement no 
r 
we adopted statement no 
r effective june  using the modified prospective method which requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of this statement  for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
we will continue to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will negatively impact our results of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
however  had statement no 
r been effective in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
as of june   the unrecognized compensation expense associated with the remaining portion of the unvested outstanding awards is million million  net of tax 
statement no 
r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of statement no 
r 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million in fiscal and fiscal  and million in fiscal impact of recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 


sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this new standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after november  our adoption of the standard in the fiscal year beginning june  is not likely to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
sfas no 
r in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values

r effective june  using the modified prospective method which requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of this statement  for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by statement no 
 for periods prior to june   we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for the granting of employee stock options  except as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will negatively impact our statements of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
however  had statement no 
r been effective in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
as of june   the unrecognized compensation expense associated with the remaining portion of the unvested outstanding awards is million million  net of tax 
statement no 
r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of statement no 
r 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million in fiscal and fiscal  and million in fiscal sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of the standard in the fiscal year beginning june  is not likely to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks for foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent for interest rates that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we have repaid all of our interest bearing debts during fiscal and interest rate risk applies only to our cash and short term investment portfolio 
to manage the volatility related to these typical business exposures  we may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we are not currently subject to significant market risks for commodity prices or other relevant market price risks 
foreign currency risk 
operating income generated outside the united states as a percentage of total operating income was in  in and in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally with the us dollar versus the euro  canadian dollar and japanese yen  could impact our operating results 
it has not been the company s practice to actively hedge its foreign subsidiaries assets or liabilities denominated in local currency 
during fiscal year ended may   the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk increased slightly with the purchase of immucor kainos  inc  the company s new subsidiary which had financial instruments of approximately million at may  also  future payment obligations totaling million related to the acquisition of immucor kainos are denominated in japanese yen  and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in   and  the company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  million and million  respectively  and foreign currency translation gains of million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  a decrease compared to fiscal in the us euro weighted average exchange rate decreased net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in the year to date weighted average euro exchange rate would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
in case of us canadian dollar  a increase in fiscal compared to fiscal in the weighted average exchange rate increased net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in the year to date weighted average canadian dollar exchange rate would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk 
we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which generally have a term of less than one year  with high quality financial institutions and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of may   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during fiscal  average short term interest rates decreased by from fiscal average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our projected interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately million
