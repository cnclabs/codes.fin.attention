item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management market risk for a further discussion of the market risks to which we are exposed 
our client flow revenues may decline in adverse market conditions 
we have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years though  recently  central banks have been raising rates 
increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses 
in particular  in our mortgage origination and securitization businesses  rising interest rates may cause a decline in the volume of mortgage origination activity  and therefore may also decrease the volume of securitizations 
declining real estate values could also reduce our level of new mortgage loan originations and securitizations 
our investment banking revenues  in the form of financial advisory and debt and equity underwriting fees  are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn 
a market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and  therefore  to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads earned from the trades we execute for our clients 
in addition  because the fees that we charge for managing our clients portfolios are in many cases based on the value of those portfolios  a market downturn that reduces the value of our clients portfolios would reduce the revenue we receive from our asset management business 
even in the absence of a market downturn  below market investment performance could reduce investment management revenues and assets under management 
we may incur losses in our capital markets business segment due to fluctuations in market rates  prices and volatility 
market risk is inherent in our client driven market making transactions in equity and fixed income securities and derivatives and our mortgage origination and loan syndication activities 
fluctuations in market rates  prices and volatility can adversely affect the market value of our long or short inventory positions and  to the extent that such positions are not hedged  cause the firm to incur losses 
in our client driven market making transactions  we maintain substantial inventory positions from time to time  acting as a financial intermediary for our clients  and we hold inventory positions in the normal course of business to allow clients to rebalance their portfolios and diversify risks across market cycles 
to the extent that we hold long inventory positions  a downturn in the market could result in losses from a decline in the value of those positions 
on the other hand  to the extent that we have sold inventory short  an upturn in those markets could expose us to losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market 
in our mortgage origination and securitization businesses  we are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates 
most residential mortgages provide that the borrower may repay them early 
borrowers often exercise this right when interest rates decline 
as prepayments increase  the value of mortgages held in inventory prior to securitization generally will decrease  and to the extent that prepayment risk has not been hedged  prepayments may result in a loss 
we also maintain long and short positions through our proprietary trading activities  and make principal investments in real estate and private equity  which are also subject to market risks 
the value of these positions can be adversely lehman brothers holdings inc 
affected by changes in market rates  prices and volatility 
holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses 
concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our market making  block trading  underwriting  proprietary trading and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements 
we have committed substantial amounts of capital to these businesses  which often require us to take large positions in the securities of  or make large loans to  a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry  country or region 
moreover  the trend in all major capital markets is towards larger and more frequent commitments of capital in many of these activities  and we expect this trend to continue 
market risk may increase the other risks that we face 
in addition to the potentially adverse effects on our businesses described above  market risk could exacerbate other risks that we face 
for example  if we were to incur substantial market risk losses  our need for liquidity could rise significantly  while our access to liquidity could be impaired 
in addition  in conjunction with a market downturn  our clients and counterparties could incur substantial losses of their own  thereby weakening their financial condition and increasing our credit risk to them 
credit risk we may incur losses associated with our credit exposures 
credit risk represents the possibility a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other financial instruments we hold or a borrower of funds from us will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
default risk may also arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect  such as fraud 
credit risk may arise  for example  from holding securities of third parties  entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us  executing securities  futures  currency or commodity trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries  and extending credit to our clients through bridge or margin loans or other arrangements 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk for a further discussion of the credit risks to which we are exposed 
our principal focus has been acting as an intermediary of credit 
in recent years  we have expanded our activities associated with providing our clients access to credit and liquidity and have significantly expanded our swaps and other derivatives businesses 
as a result  our credit exposures have increased in amount and in duration 
defaults by another large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally 
the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit  trading  clearing or other relationships between the institutions 
as a result  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant market wide liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions 
this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries  such as clearing agencies  clearing houses  banks  securities firms and exchanges  with which we interact on a daily basis  and therefore could adversely affect lehman brothers 
liquidity risk liquidity  that is  ready access to funds  is essential to our businesses 
financial institutions rely on external borrowings for the vast majority of their funding  and failures in our industry are typically the result of insufficient liquidity 
an inability to access the debt markets could impair our liquidity 
we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that is intended to cover all expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment  which assumes  among other things  that during that year we cannot issue unsecured debt 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity risk management  for a discussion of our liquidity needs and liquidity management 
to the extent that a liquidity event lasts for more than one year  or our expectations concerning the market conditions that exist during a liquidity event  or our access to funds  prove to be inaccurate eg  the level of secured financing haircuts the difference between the market and pledge value of the assets required to fund our assets in a stressed market event is greater than expected  or the amount of drawdowns under our commitments to extend credit in a stressed market environment exceeds our expectations  our ability to fund operations could be significantly impaired 
even within the one year time frame contemplated by our liquidity pool  we depend on continuous access to secured financing in the repurchase and securities lending markets  which could be impaired by factors that are not lehman brothers holdings inc 
specific to lehman brothers  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets 
we are a holding company and are dependent on our subsidiaries for funds 
since holdings is primarily a holding company  our cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations under securities we issue are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings as dividends or loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to us 
several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory  banking and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate and or to capital targets established by various ratings agencies 
these regulatory rules  and certain covenants contained in various debt agreements  may restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our subsidiaries by dividends  loans or other payments 
further information about these requirements and restrictions is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  of this report 
additionally  our ability to participate as an equity holder in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation is generally subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary 
credit ratings our borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings 
a reduction in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
credit ratings are also important to us when competing in certain markets  such as longer term over the counter derivatives 
therefore  a substantial reduction in our credit ratings would reduce our earnings and adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity risk management and credit ratings  for additional information concerning our credit ratings 
operational risk operational risks may disrupt our businesses  result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth 
we face operational risk arising from errors made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted for 
derivative contracts  particularly credit derivatives  are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis  while the transaction remains unconfirmed  we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies  and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
consequently  we rely heavily on our financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
in recent years  we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology  and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by lehman brothers or third parties with which we conduct business  terrorist activities or disease pandemics 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in part ii  item  of this report for a description of our risk management infrastructure and procedures 
acquisitions or joint ventures could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs 
acquisitions and joint ventures involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including difficulty with integrating personnel and financial and other systems  hiring additional management and other critical personnel and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
in addition  we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition  and we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
legal  regulatory and reputational risk we face significant litigation risks in our businesses 
the volume of litigation against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed has increased over the past several years 
we are exposed to potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions  potential liability for the fairness opinions and other advice we provide to participants in corporate transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
we also face the possibility that counterparties in complex or risky trading transactions will claim that we improperly failed to tell them of the risks or that they were not authorized or permitted to enter into these transactions with us and that their obligations to lehman brothers are not enforceable 
in our investment management segment  we are exposed to claims against us for recommending investments that are not consistent with a client s investment objectives or engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading 
during a prolonged market downturn  we would expect these types of claims to increase 
we are also subject to claims arising from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment  among other things 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify  and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we incur significant legal expenses every year in defending against litigation  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for a discussion of some of the legal and regulatory matters in which we are currently involved 
extensive regulation of our businesses limits our activities and may subject us to significant penalties 
lehman brothers  as a participant in the financial services industry  is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in the us and under the laws of the many global jurisdictions in which we do business 
we are also regulated by a number of self regulatory organizations 
the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators  including the sec  nyse  nasd and state attorneys general 
penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities in our industry have increased substantially over the last several years 
the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with lehman brothers 
consequently  these regulations often serve to limit our activities  including through net capital  customer protection and market conduct requirements 
if we were found to have breached certain of these rules or regulations  we could face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities  including extended investigation and surveillance activity  adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties 
among other things  we could be fined or prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities 
see part i  item  business regulation for a further discussion of the regulatory environment in which we conduct our businesses 
additional legislation and regulations  changes in rules imposed by regulatory authorities  self regulatory organizations and exchanges or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may adversely affect our business and profitability 
our business may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable to us as an investment bank  but also by regulations of general application  including existing and proposed tax legislation and other governmental regulations and policies including the interest rate and monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other central banks and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities 
exposure to reputational risks could impact the value of our brand 
our reputation is critical in maintaining our relationships with clients  investors  regulators and the general public  and is a key focus in our risk management efforts 
in recent years there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud  conflicts of interest or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry  and we run the risk that misconduct by our employees could occur 
misconduct by employees could include binding lehman brothers to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks  or hiding from lehman brothers unauthorized or unsuccessful activities  which  in either case  may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm 
it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
in addition  in certain circumstances our reputation could be damaged by activities of our clients in which we participate  over which we have little or no control 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
competitive environment all aspects of our business are highly competitive 
our competitive success depends on many factors  including our reputation  the quality of our services and advice  intellectual capital  product innovation  execution ability  pricing  sales efforts  and the talent of our personnel 
we face increased competition due to a trend toward consolidation 
in recent years  there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry 
in particular  a number of large commercial banks  insurance companies and other broad based financial services firms have established or acquired broker dealers or have merged with other financial institutions 
many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products  from loans  deposit taking and insurance to brokerage  asset management and investment banking services  which may enhance their competitive position 
they also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking  insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share  which has resulted in pricing pressure in our businesses 
we have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years 
for example  equity and debt underwriting and trading spreads and fees for lending and other activities have been under competitive pressures for a number of years 
our revenues may decline due to competition from alternative trading systems 
securities and futures transactions are now being conducted through the internet and other alternative  non traditional trading systems  and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate 
a dramatic increase in computer based or other electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues 
our ability to retain our key employees is critical to the success of our business 
our people are our most important resource 
our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract top talent and retain and motivate our existing employees while managing compensation costs 
risk management we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk  including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated 
some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior 
as a result  these methods may not predict future risk exposures  which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate 
management of operational  legal and regulatory risk requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events  and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management  for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify  monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses

in re fleming securities litigation in february  a lawsuit captioned massachusetts state carpenters pension fund v 
fleming companies  inc  et al 
was filed in the th district court of dallas county  texas  asserting claims arising under sections  a  and of the securities act 
the action was brought on behalf of a purported class of investors who purchased in two simultaneous fleming securities offerings in june that raised approximately million 
lbi s share of these offerings as underwriter was 
the complaint alleged that the prospectus and registration statement for the offerings contained false and misleading statements or omitted material facts concerning  among other things  deductions fleming took on vendor invoices  its accounting for recognition of income  amortization of long term assets and use of capitalized interest and the performance of fleming s retail operations 
the complaint sought unspecified damages and costs 
in addition to fleming  the suit named as defendants ten officers and or directors of fleming  fleming s auditor  and the underwriters of the offerings  including lbi 
the case was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of texas 
the underwriters were contractually entitled to customary indemnification from fleming  but in april  fleming filed for bankruptcy protection 
also in april  plaintiffs filed a virtually identical second lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
in june  the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the securities litigations concerning fleming to which lbi was not a party in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
subsequently  in september  plaintiffs in the two massachusetts state carpenters pension fund cases to which lbi is a party  and plaintiffs in the consolidated actions  jointly filed a third consolidated amended class action complaint  which  as to lbi  in substance re alleged the claims set forth in the original massachusetts state carpenters pension fund cases 
thereafter  in june  plaintiffs filed a fourth consolidated amended class action complaint adding details to the allegations in the prior complaint concerning lead plaintiffs purchases in the offerings  and a fifth complaint was filed in december  which added no new allegations or claims against lbi 
the parties agreed to a settlement of this action as to which the court granted final approval on november  ipo allocation cases lbi was named as a defendant in approximately purported securities class actions that were filed between march and december in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the new york district court 
the actions  which allege improper ipo allocation practices  were brought by persons who  either directly or in the aftermarket  purchased ipo securities during the period between march and december the plaintiffs allege that lehman and other ipo underwriters required persons receiving allocations of ipo shares to pay excessive commissions on unrelated trades and to purchase shares in the aftermarket at specified escalating prices 
the plaintiffs  who seek unspecified compensatory damages  claim that these alleged practices violated various provisions of the federal securities laws  specifically sections  a and of the securities act  sections b and a of the exchange act 
the actions in which lbi was named a defendant have been consolidated into cases  each involving a distinct offering 
those consolidated cases  and approximately others in which lbi is not named as a defendant  have been coordinated for pretrial purposes before a single judge

unlike the delaware action  which breakaway purports to bring on behalf of a class of issuers  the new york action concerns claims brought only on behalf of breakaway

we believe net assets is a measure more useful to investors than total assets when comparing companies in the securities industry because it excludes certain assets considered to have a low risk profile and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
net assets as presented are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies in the securities industry because of different methods of calculation

further  we do not view the amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and goodwill as available to support our remaining net assets

gross leverage ratio is defined as total assets divided by total stockholders equity 
net leverage ratio is defined as net assets see note above divided by tangible equity capital see note above 
we believe net leverage is a more meaningful measure of leverage to evaluate companies in the securities industry

business environment as a global investment bank  our results of operations can vary in response to global economic and market trends and geopolitical events 
a favorable business environment is characterized by many factors  including a stable geopolitical climate  transparent financial markets  low inflation  low unemployment  strong business profitability and high business and investor confidence 
these factors can influence i levels of debt and equity security issuance and m a activity  which can affect our investment banking business  ii trading volumes  financial instrument and real estate valuations and client activity in secondary financial markets  which can affect our capital markets businesses and iii wealth creation  which can affect both our capital markets and investment management businesses 
the global market environment during was generally favorable for our businesses due to a combination of factors positive economic growth  improved corporate profitability  strong equity markets  and low long term interest rates by historical standards 
the global equity markets rose  driven by strong earnings reports and positive economic data  notwithstanding record high oil prices and continued geopolitical and inflationary concerns 
global yield curves continued to flatten and corporate credit spreads remained generally tight 
the economies of asia excluding japan continued their strong growth in  while the european and japanese economies grew more slowly 
at various points in  market conditions became more challenging due to higher energy prices  the aftermath of the hurricanes in the southeast us and concerns that these factors could translate into higher core inflation 
oil prices reaching a barrel and higher than expected producer and consumer price indices also added uncertainty  volatility and a higher risk premium to the capital markets 
however  both the consumer and the markets generally proved to be remarkably resilient 
equity markets 
the global equity markets reported broad gains during  due primarily to positive economic data and strong earnings reports

japan continued on its recovery path  with the bank of japan providing favorable monetary policies which continued to support liquidity and growth

economic outlook the financial services industry is significantly influenced by worldwide economic conditions in both banking and capital markets 
we expect global gdp growth of for  a level that continues to provide a favorable underpinning for lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this industry 
we expect the fed to continue raising rates to by mid and then keeping interest rates steady 
the end of the fed s rising interest rate cycle in the past has been positive for our sector 
we expect that corporate profitability will remain resilient  and we are looking for corporate earnings to increase by to in additionally  us corporate balance sheets remain strong and operating cash flows solid  with cash on hand amounting to approximately of total balance sheets  giving corporations a higher degree of flexibility for mergers and acquisitions  buybacks and dividends 
although we remain wary of geopolitical risk  the growing deficits in the us  and china s efforts to rein in growth  we see resiliency in the global economy as a whole 
equity markets 
the environment for the equity markets became more positive in compared with liquidity remained available and industry wide equity offering pipelines continued to grow 
we expect the equity offering calendar to remain robust through  as reasonably strong corporate profitability and a low inflation outlook are expected to increase confidence in the marketplace 
fixed income markets 
we see a continued constructive environment for fixed income origination  given low absolute interest rates  credit spreads remaining in line with historical averages  refinancings of debt maturing in calendar and the expected increase in m a and financial sponsor related financings 
we expect both fixed income related products and the fixed income investor base to continue to grow with a continuing global trend of more liquidity requirements being sourced from the capital markets 
we also believe a reasonably strong primary debt market should have a positive impact on secondary market flows 
fixed income activity is driven in part by the absolute level of interest rates  but also is highly correlated with the degree of volatility  the shape of the yield curve and credit quality  which in the aggregate  impact the overall business environment 
the fixed income investor base has changed dramatically from long only investors of a few years ago to a rapidly growing hedge fund and an expanding international investor base 
investors now employ far more developed risk mitigation tools to manage their portfolios 
in addition  in recent years the fed has become more transparent in communicating its intentions  as evidenced by the market s ability to successfully absorb twelve consecutive basis point fed funds rate hikes from june  through november   to bring the fed funds rate to 
we believe that the fed will continue its pattern of raising rates until it reaches in in addition  the size and diversity of the global fixed income marketplace has become significantly larger and broader over the last several years 
we expect approximately trillion of global fixed income origination in calendar  staying constant with issuance levels  but almost double the trillion issued in calendar mergers and acquisitions 
during fiscal  m a activity increased significantly  and we expect this to continue 
companies are still looking to grow  and strategic m a is an increasingly viable option to achieve these growth objectives  particularly for companies with liquid and strong balance sheets and stronger stock valuations 
during fiscal and  activity from strategic buyers increased  and we expect the m a fee pool in fiscal to continue to grow compared with fiscal financial sponsor m a also has been an important factor driving the increase in activity 
asset management and high net worth 
capital markets continued to be resilient in  and growing economies translate into wealth 
we aspire to be a provider of choice among the high net worth client base  given our growing product breadth and strong performance 
our outlook for asset management and services to high net worth individuals is positive  given favorable demographics  higher savings rates globally and intergenerational wealth transfer 
the high net worth client increasingly seeks multiple providers and greater asset diversification along with a high service component 
we believe the significant expansion of our asset management business and the strong investment return performance of our asset managers  coupled with our cross selling initiatives  position us well for continued growth in consolidated results of operations overview we achieved record net revenues  net income and diluted earnings per share in for the second consecutive fiscal year

principal transactions  commissions and net interest revenues in both the capital markets and investment management business segments  we evaluate net revenue performance based on the aggregate of principal transactions  commissions and interest and dividends revenue net of interest expense net interest revenue 
these revenue categories include realized and unrealized gains and losses  commissions associated with client transactions and the interest and dividend revenue or interest expense associated with financing or hedging positions 
caution should be used when analyzing these revenue categories individually because they may not be indicative of the overall performance of the capital markets and investment management business segments 
principal transactions  commissions and net interest revenue in the aggregate rose in compared with and in compared with principal transactions revenue improved in compared with  driven by improvements across both fixed income and equity products  including a higher contribution from non us regions 
in fixed income capital markets the notable increases were in commercial mortgages and real estate  residential mortgages and interest rate products 
the return on average common stockholders equity and return on average tangible common stockholders equity are computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock for the period by average common stockholders equity and average tangible common stockholders equity  respectively 
we believe average tangible common stockholders equity is a meaningful measure because it reflects the common stockholders equity deployed in our businesses 
average tangible common stockholders equity equals average common stockholders equity less average identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and is computed as follows year ended november in millions average common stockholders equity    average identifiable intangible assets and goodwill   average tangible common stockholders equity    lehman brothers holdings inc

these improvements were partially offset by lower results in real estate attributable to the further softening of certain sectors within the commercial real estate market and lower results in convertibles as the rising interest rate environment in the second half of negatively affected the convertible market 
investment banking revenues were up significantly as we continued to gain market share in both equity and debt origination  although m a market share declined 
net revenues in asia pacific and other rose in compared with  reflecting strong investment banking and capital markets net revenues 
investment banking benefited from several non public structured equity transactions for clients in capital markets net revenues increased in primarily from strong performances in high yield and equity derivatives

liquidity  funding and capital resources management s finance committee is responsible for developing  implementing and enforcing our liquidity  funding and capital policies 
these policies include recommendations for capital and balance sheet size as well as the allocation of capital and balance sheet to the business units 
management s finance committee oversees compliance with policies and limits with the goal of ensuring we are not exposed to undue liquidity  funding or capital risk 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk management we view liquidity and liquidity management as critically important to the company 
our liquidity strategy seeks to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all of our funding obligations in all market environments 
our liquidity strategy is centered on five principles we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that is of sufficient size to cover expected cash outflows over the next twelve months in a stressed liquidity environment 
we rely on secured funding only to the extent that we believe it would be available in all market environments 
we aim to diversify our funding sources to minimize reliance on any given providers 
liquidity is assessed at the entity level 
for example  because our legal entity structure can constrain liquidity available to holdings  our liquidity pool excludes liquidity that is restricted from availability to holdings 
we maintain a comprehensive funding action plan that represents a detailed action plan to manage a stress liquidity event  including a communication plan for regulators  creditors  investors and clients 
liquidity pool 
we maintain a liquidity pool available to holdings that covers expected cash outflows for twelve months in a stressed liquidity environment 
in assessing the required size of our liquidity pool  we assume that assets outside the liquidity pool cannot be sold to generate cash  unsecured debt cannot be issued  and any cash and unencumbered liquid collateral outside of the liquidity pool cannot be used to support the liquidity of holdings 
our liquidity pool is sized to cover expected cash outflows associated with the following items the repayment of all unsecured debt maturing in the next twelve months billion at november  
the funding of commitments to extend credit made by holdings and its unregulated subsidiaries based on a probabilistic analysis of these drawdowns 
the funding of commitments to extend credit made by our regulated subsidiaries is covered by the liquidity pools maintained by these subsidiaries 
see summary of contractual obligations and commitments lending related commitments in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of adverse changes on secured funding either in the form of wider haircuts the difference between the market and pledge value of assets or in the form of reduced borrowing availability 
the anticipated funding requirements of equity repurchases as we manage our equity base including offsetting the dilutive effect of our employee incentive plans see liquidity  funding and capital resources equity management in this md a 
in addition  the liquidity pool is sized to cover the impact of a one notch downgrade of holdings long term debt ratings  including the additional collateral required for our derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit ratings in this md a 
the liquidity pool is primarily invested in highly liquid instruments including money market funds  bank deposits  us  european and japanese government bonds  and us agency securities  with the balance invested in liquid securities that we believe have a highly reliable pledge value 
we calculate our liquidity pool on a daily basis 
at november   the estimated pledge value of the liquidity pool available to holdings was billion  which is in excess of the items discussed above 
additionally  our regulated subsidiaries  such as our broker dealers and bank institutions maintain their own liquidity pools to cover their stand alone one year expected cash funding needs in a stressed liquidity environment 
the estimated pledge value of the liquidity pools held by our regulated subsidiaries totaled an additional billion at november  lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding of assets 
we fund assets based on their liquidity characteristics  and utilize cash capital for our long term funding needs 
our funding strategy incorporates the following factors liquid assets ie  assets for which a reliable secured funding market exists across all market environments including government bonds  us agency securities  corporate bonds  asset backed securities and high quality equity securities are primarily funded on a secured basis 
secured funding haircuts are funded with cash capital illiquid assets eg  fixed assets  intangible assets  and margin postings and less liquid inventory positions eg  derivatives  private equity investments  certain corporate loans  certain commercial mortgages and real estate positions are funded with cash capital 
unencumbered assets  irrespective of asset quality  that are not part of the liquidity pool are also funded with cash capital 
these assets are typically unencumbered because of operational and asset specific factors eg  securities moving between depots 
we do not assume a change in these factors during a stressed liquidity event 
as part of our funding strategy  we also take steps to mitigate our main sources of contingent liquidity risk as follows commitments to extend credit cash capital is utilized to cover expected funding of commitments to extend credit 
see summary of contractual obligations and commitments lending related commitments in this md a 
ratings downgrade cash capital is utilized to cover the liquidity impact of a one notch downgrade on holdings 
a rating downgrade would increase the amount of collateral to be posted against our derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
see liquidity  funding and capital resources credit ratings in this md a 
customer financing we provide secured financing to our clients typically through repurchase and prime broker agreements 
these financing activities can create liquidity risk if the availability and terms of our secured borrowing agreements adversely change during a stressed liquidity event and we are unable to reflect these changes in our customer financing agreements 
we mitigate this risk by entering into term secured borrowing agreements  in which we can fund different types of collateral at pre determined collateralization levels  and by the liquidity pools maintained at our broker dealers 
our policy is to operate with an excess of long term funding sources over our long term funding requirements 
we seek to maintain a cash capital surplus at holdings of at least billion 
as of november  and november   our cash capital surplus at holdings totaled billion and billion  respectively 
additionally  cash capital surpluses in regulated entities at november  and amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
diversification of funding sources 
we seek to diversify our funding sources 
we issue long term debt in multiple currencies and across a wide range of maturities to tap many investor bases  thereby reducing our reliance on any one source 
during  we issued billion of long term borrowings 
long term borrowings increased to billion at november  from billion at november   with weighted average maturities of years and years  respectively above our targeted minimum weighted average maturity of four years 
we diversify our issuances geographically to minimize refinancing risk and broaden our debt holder base 
as of november   of our long term debt was issued outside the united states 
we typically issue in a single maturity in sufficient size to create a liquid benchmark issuance ie  sufficient size to be included in the lehman bond index  a widely used index for fixed income asset managers 
in order to minimize refinancing risk  we set limits for the amount of long term borrowings maturing over any three  six and twelve month horizon at  and of outstanding long term borrowings  respectively cash capital consists of stockholders equity  core deposit liabilities at our bank subsidiaries  the undrawn portion of committed credit facilities with greater than one year remaining life and liabilities with remaining terms of over one year 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that is  billion  billion and billion  respectively  at november  if we were to operate with debt above these levels  we would not include the additional amount as a source of cash capital 
extendible issuances in which  unless debt holders instruct us to redeem their debt instruments at least one year prior to stated maturity  the maturity date of these instruments is automatically extended are included in these limits at their earliest maturity date 
based on experience  we expect the majority of these extendibles to remain outstanding beyond their earliest maturity date in a normal market environment and roll through the long term borrowings maturity profile 
the quarterly long term borrowings maturity schedule over the next five years at november  is as follows long term borrowings maturity profile chart graphic we use both committed and uncommitted bilateral and syndicated long term bank facilities to complement our long term debt issuance 
in particular  holdings maintains an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks under which the banks have committed to provide up to billion to holdings through april we also maintain a billion multi currency unsecured committed revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for lehman brothers bankhaus the facility 
the facility has a term of three and a half years expiring in april there were no borrowings outstanding under either the credit agreement or the facility at november  bank facilities provide us with further diversification and flexibility 
for example  we draw on our committed syndicated credit facilities described above on a regular basis typically to of the time on a weighted average basis to provide us with additional sources of cash capital on an as needed basis 
we own three bank entities lehman brothers bank  a us based thrift institution  lehman brothers commercial bank  a us based industrial bank  and lehman brothers bankhaus  a german bank 
these regulated bank entities operate in a deposit protected environment and are able to source low cost unsecured funds that are primarily term deposits 
these are generally insulated from a company specific or market liquidity event  thereby providing a reliable funding source for our mortgage products and selected loan assets and increasing our funding diversification 
overall  these bank institutions have raised billion and billion of customer deposit liabilities as of november  and  respectively 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legal entity structure 
our legal entity structure can constrain liquidity available to holdings 
some of our legal entities  particularly our regulated broker dealers and bank institutions  are restricted in the amount of funds that they can distribute or lend to holdings 
as of november   holdings total equity capital defined as total stockholders equity of billion plus billion of junior subordinated notes amounted to billion 
we believe total equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of our equity than stockholders equity because junior subordinated notes are deeply subordinated and have maturities of at least years at issuance 
leading rating agencies view these securities as equity capital for purposes of calculating net leverage 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we aim to maintain a primary equity double leverage ratio the ratio of equity investments in holdings subsidiaries to its total equity capital of x or below 
our primary equity double leverage ratio was x as of november  and certain regulated subsidiaries are funded with subordinated debt issuances and or subordinated loans from holdings  which are counted as regulatory capital for those subsidiaries 
our policy is to fund subordinated debt advances by holdings to subsidiaries for use as regulatory capital with long term debt issued by holdings having a maturity at least one year greater than the maturity of the subordinated debt advance 
funding action plan 
we have developed and regularly update a funding action plan  which represents a detailed action plan to manage a stress liquidity event  including a communication plan for regulators  creditors  investors and clients 
the funding action plan considers two types of liquidity stress events a company specific event  where there are no issues with the overall market liquidity  and a broader market wide event  which affects not just our company but the entire market 
in a company specific event  we assume we would lose access to the unsecured funding market for a full year and have to rely on the liquidity pool available to holdings to continue to fund our balance sheet 
in a market liquidity event  in addition to the pressure of a company specific event  we also assume that  because the event is market wide  some counterparties to whom we have extended liquidity facilities draw on these facilities 
to mitigate the effect of a market liquidity event  we have developed access to additional liquidity sources beyond the liquidity pool at holdings 
these sources include unutilized funding capacity in our bank entities  a conduit pre funded with short term liquid instruments  and unutilized capacity in our bank facilities 
see liquidity risk management funding of assets in this md a 
we perform regular assessments of our funding requirements in stress liquidity scenarios to best ensure we can meet all our funding obligations in all market environments 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents declined billion at november  compared with november   as net cash used in operating activities of billion attributable primarily to growth in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned coupled with net cash used in investing activities of million exceeded net cash provided by financing activities of billion 
cash and cash equivalents declined billion at november  compared with november   as net cash used in operating activities of billion attributable primarily to growth in secured financing activities coupled with net cash used in investing activities of million exceeded net cash provided by financing activities of billion 
balance sheet and financial leverage assets 
our balance sheet consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and collateralized financing agreements 
the liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business 
the majority of these assets are funded on a secured basis through collateralized financing agreements 
our total assets at november  increased to billion at november  compared with billion at november   primarily due to an increase in secured financing transactions and net assets 
net assets at november  increased billion primarily due to increases in mortgages and mortgage backed inventory positions  equities and corporate debt 
we believe net assets is a more useful measure than total assets when comparing companies in the securities industry because it excludes certain assets considered to have a low risk profile including lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes  securities received as collateral  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
this definition of net assets is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency to evaluate companies in the securities industry 
under this definition  net assets were billion and billion at november  and november   respectively  as follows net assets in millions november total assets   cash and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes   securities received as collateral   securities purchased under agreements to resell   securities borrowed   identifiable intangible assets and goodwill   net assets   our net assets consist of inventory necessary to facilitate client flow activities and  to a lesser degree  proprietary activities 
as such  our mix of net assets is subject to change depending primarily on client demand 
in addition  due to the nature of our client flow activities and based on our business outlook  the overall size of our balance sheet will fluctuate from time to time and  at specific points in time  may be higher than the year end or quarter end amounts 
our total assets at quarter ends were  on average  approximately lower than amounts based on a monthly average over both the four and eight quarters ended november  our net assets at quarter ends were  on average  approximately lower than amounts based on a monthly average over both the four and eight quarters ended november  leverage ratios 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one measure used to evaluate the capital adequacy of a company 
the gross leverage ratio is calculated as total assets divided by total stockholders equity 
our gross leverage ratios were x and x at november  and  respectively 
however  we believe net leverage based on net assets as defined above which excludes certain assets considered to have a low risk profile and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill divided by tangible equity capital total stockholders equity plus junior subordinated notes less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  to be a more meaningful measure of leverage in evaluating companies in the securities industry 
our net leverage ratio of x at november  declined from x at november  as we increased our tangible equity capital proportionately more than we increased our net assets 
we believe tangible equity capital to be a more representative measure of our equity for purposes of calculating net leverage because junior subordinated notes are subordinated and have maturities at issuance from to years and we do not view the amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and goodwill as available to support our remaining net assets 
this definition of net leverage is used by many of our creditors and a leading rating agency 
tangible equity capital and net leverage are computed as follows at november  and tangible equity capital and net leverage in millions november total stockholders equity   junior subordinated notes   identifiable intangible assets and goodwill   tangible equity capital   gross leverage x x net leverage x x see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net assets  tangible equity capital and net leverage as presented above are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies in the securities industry because of different methods of calculation 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations equity management the management of equity is a critical aspect of our capital management 
the determination of the appropriate amount of equity is affected by a number of factors  including the amount of risk equity needed  the capital required by our regulators  balance sheet leverage and the dilutive effects of equity based employee awards 
equity requirements constantly are changing  and we actively monitor risk requirements and potential investment opportunities 
we continuously look at investment alternatives for our equity with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
in addition  in managing our capital  returning capital to shareholders by repurchasing shares is among the alternatives considered 
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital 
our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases  as well as through employee transactions where employees tender shares of common stock to pay for the exercise price of stock options  and the required tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of restricted stock units to freely tradable common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock through open market purchases at an aggregate cost of billion  or per share 
in addition  we withheld approximately million shares of common stock from employees at an equivalent cost of billion  principally done in the last quarter of for  our board of directors has authorized the repurchase  subject to market conditions  of up to million shares of holdings common stock for the management of our equity capital  including offsetting dilution due to equity based award plans 
our board also authorized the repurchase in  subject to market conditions  of up to an additional million shares  for the possible acceleration of repurchases to offset a portion of dilution due to equity based award plans 
this authorization supersedes the stock repurchase program authorized in january included below are the changes in our tangible equity capital during the years ended november  and november  tangible equity capital in millions year ended november beginning tangible equity capital   net income   dividends on common stock dividends on preferred stock common stock open market repurchases   common stock withheld from employees  equity based award plans   net change in preferred stock net change in junior subordinated notes included in tangible equity other  net ending tangible equity capital   represents shares of common stock withheld in satisfaction of the exercise price of stock options and tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of restricted stock units 
this represents the sum of i proceeds received from employees upon the exercise of stock options  ii the incremental tax benefits from the issuance of stock based awards and iii the value of employee services received as represented by the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
junior subordinated notes are subordinated and have maturities at issuance from to years and are utilized in calculating equity capital by a leading rating agency 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit ratings like other companies in the securities industry  we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are affected by our short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that may be significant to the determination of our credit ratings or otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing include our profit margin  our earnings trend and volatility  our cash liquidity and liquidity management  our capital structure  our risk level and risk management  our geographic and business diversification  and our relative positions in the markets in which we operate 
a deterioration in any of these factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings 
this may increase the cost of  or possibly limit our access to  certain types of unsecured financings and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements 
in addition  our debt ratings can affect certain capital markets revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
in october  standard poor s ratings services s p raised its long term counterparty credit rating on holdings to a with a stable outlook from a with a positive outlook  and also raised lehman brothers inc s lbi short and long term ratings by one notch 
in july  fitch ratings upgraded holdings and lbi s short term debt ratings from f to f  fitch s highest short term rating 
at november   the short and long term borrowings ratings of holdings and lbi were as follows credit ratings holdings lbi short term long term short term long term standard poor s ratings services a a a aa moody s investors service p a p aa fitch ratings f a f a dominion bond rating service limited r middle a high r middle aa low a high senior subordinated 
at november   counterparties had the right to require us to post additional collateral pursuant to derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements of approximately billion 
additionally  at that date we would have been required to post additional collateral pursuant to such arrangements of approximately billion in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of one notch and billion in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of two notches 
summary of contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  we enter into various commitments and guarantees  including lending commitments to high grade and high yield borrowers  private equity investment commitments  liquidity commitments and other guarantees 
in all instances  we mark to market these commitments and guarantees  with changes in fair value recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
lending related commitments through our high grade and high yield sales  trading  underwriting and mortgage origination activities  we make commitments to extend credit in loan syndication transactions 
we use various hedging and funding strategies to actively manage our market  credit and liquidity exposures on these commitments 
we do not believe total commitments necessarily are indicative of actual risk or funding requirements because the commitments may not be drawn or fully used and such amounts are reported before consideration of hedges 
these commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower 
we define high yield non investment grade exposures as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
in addition  our residential and commercial mortgage platforms in our capital markets business make commitments to extend mortgage loans 
from lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations time to time  we may also provide contingent commitments to investment and non investment grade counterparties related to acquisition financing 
our expectation is  and our past practice has been  to distribute through loan syndications to investors substantially all the credit risk associated with these acquisition financing loans  if closed  consistent with our credit facilitation framework 
we do not believe these commitments are necessarily indicative of our actual risk because the borrower may not complete a contemplated acquisition or  if the borrower completes the acquisition  often will raise funds in the capital markets instead of drawing on our commitment 
in addition  our capital markets businesses enter into secured financing commitments 
lending related commitments at november  and were as follows amount of commitment expiration per period total contractual amount in millions and later november november high grade      high yield     mortgage commitments   investment grade contingent acquisition facilities   non investment grade contingent acquisition facilities   secured lending transactions  including forward starting resale and repurchase agreements    we view our net credit exposure for high grade commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we view our net credit exposure for high yield commitments  after consideration of hedges  to be billion and billion at november  and  respectively

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase obligations contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including securities financing transactions  trading liabilities  deposits  commercial paper and other short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we engage in a variety of off balance sheet arrangements  including derivative contracts 
derivatives derivatives often are referred to as off balance sheet instruments because neither their notional amounts nor the underlying instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities in our consolidated statement of financial condition 
instead  the market or fair values related to the derivative transactions are reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition as assets or liabilities in derivatives and other contractual agreements  as applicable 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and as an end user 
we use derivative products in a trading capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients and to manage our own exposure to market and credit risks resulting from our trading activities collectively  trading related derivative activities 
in this capacity  we transact extensively in derivatives including interest rate  credit both single name and portfolio  foreign exchange and equity derivatives 
additionally  in the company began trading in commodity derivatives 
the use of derivative products in our trading businesses is combined with transactions in cash instruments to allow for the execution of various trading strategies 
derivatives are recorded at market or fair value in the consolidated statement of financial condition on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of set off exists and are netted across products when such provisions are stated in the master netting agreement 
as an end user  we use derivative products to adjust the interest rate nature of our funding sources from fixed to floating interest rates and to change the index on which floating interest rates are based eg  prime to libor 
we conduct our derivative activities through a number of wholly owned subsidiaries 
our fixed income derivative products business is principally conducted through our subsidiary lehman brothers special financing inc  and separately capitalized aaa rated subsidiaries  lehman brothers financial products inc and lehman brothers derivative products inc 
our equity derivative products business is conducted through lehman brothers finance sa and lehman brothers otc derivatives inc in addition  as a global investment bank  we also are a market maker in a number of foreign currencies 
counterparties to our derivative product transactions primarily are us and foreign banks  securities firms  corporations  governments and their agencies  finance companies  insurance companies  investment companies and pension funds 
we manage the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis  along with the risks associated with our non derivative trading and market making activities in cash instruments  as part of our firmwide risk management policies 
we use industry standard derivative contracts whenever appropriate 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our accounting policies and our trading related derivative activities 
special purpose entities in the normal course of business  we establish special purpose entities spes  sell assets to spes  transact derivatives with spes  own securities or residual interests in spes and provide liquidity or other guarantees for spes 
spes are corporations  trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose 
there are two types of spes qualifying special purpose entities qspes and variable interest entities vies 
spes  by their nature  generally are not controlled by their equity owners  because the establishing documents govern all material decisions 
our primary involvement with spes relates to securitization transactions through qspes  in which transferred assets are sold to an spe that issues securities supported by the cash flows generated by the assets ie  securitized 
a qspe can generally be described as an entity with significantly limited powers that are intended to limit it to passively holding financial assets and distributing cash flows to investors on pre set terms 
under sfas  we are not required to  and do not  consolidate qspes 
rather  we account for our involvement with qspes under a financial components approach in which we recognize any interest we retain after securitization at fair value  with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
we are a market leader in mortgage both residential and commercial  municipal and other asset backed securitizations that are principally transacted through qspes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our securitization activities 
in addition  we transact extensively with vies which do not meet the qspe criteria due to their permitted activities not being sufficiently limited  or because the assets are not deemed qualifying financial instruments eg  real estate 
under lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fin r  we consolidate such vies if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has either a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of such entity  as defined 
examples of our involvement with vies include collateralized debt obligations  synthetic credit transactions  real estate investments through vies  and other structured financing transactions 
for additional information about our involvement with vies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other commitments and guarantees other commitments and guarantees at november  and were as follows amount of commitment expiration per period notional maximum amount in millions and later november november derivative contracts     municipal securities related commitments    other commitments with special purpose entities    standby letters of credit   private equity and other principal investment commitments we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional amount overstates the expected payout 
at november  and the fair value of these derivative contracts approximated billion and billion  respectively

risk management as a leading global investment bank  risk is an inherent part of our business 
global markets  by their nature  are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks 
the principal risks we face are credit  market  liquidity  legal  reputation and operational risks 
risk management is considered to be of paramount importance in our day to day operations 
consequently  we devote significant resources including investments in employees and technology to the measurement  analysis and management of risk 
while risk cannot be eliminated  it can be mitigated to the greatest extent possible through a strong internal control environment 
essential in our approach to risk management is a strong internal control environment with multiple overlapping and reinforcing elements 
we have developed policies and procedures to identify  measure and monitor the risks involved in our global trading  brokerage and investment banking activities 
our approach applies analytical procedures overlaid with sound practical judgment working proactively with the business areas before transactions occur to ensure that appropriate risk mitigants are in place 
we also seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses  counterparties and activities in geographic regions 
we accomplish this objective by allocating the usage of capital to each of our businesses  establishing trading limits and setting credit limits for individual counterparties 
our focus is balancing risk versus return 
we seek to achieve adequate returns from each of our businesses commensurate with the risks they assume 
nonetheless  the effectiveness of our approach to managing risks can never be completely assured 
for example  unexpected large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in inventory values  decreases in the liquidity of trading positions  increases in our credit exposure to clients and counterparties and increases in general systemic risk 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our overall risk limits and risk management policies are established by the executive committee 
on a weekly basis  our risk committee  which consists of the executive committee  the chief risk officer and the chief financial officer  reviews all risk exposures  position concentrations and risk taking activities 
the global risk management division the division is independent of the trading areas and reports directly to the firm s chief administrative officer 
the division includes credit risk management  market risk management  quantitative risk management  sovereign risk management and operational risk management 
combining these disciplines facilitates a fully integrated approach to risk management 
the division maintains staff in each of our regional trading centers as well as in key sales offices 
risk management personnel have multiple levels of daily contact with trading staff and senior management at all levels within the company 
these discussions include reviews of trading positions and risk exposures 
credit risk credit risk represents the possibility that a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other financial instruments we hold will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk management is therefore an integral component of our overall risk management framework 
the credit risk management department the crm department has global responsibility for implementing our overall credit risk management framework 
the crm department manages the credit exposure related to trading activities by giving credit approval for counterparties  assigning internal risk ratings  establishing credit limits by counterparty  country and industry group and requiring master netting agreements and collateral in appropriate circumstances 
the crm department considers the transaction size  the duration of a transaction and the potential credit exposure for complex derivative transactions in making our credit decisions 
the crm department is responsible for the continuous monitoring and review of counterparty risk ratings  current credit exposures and potential credit exposures across all products and recommending valuation adjustments  when appropriate 
credit limits are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain appropriate in light of market events or the counterparty s financial condition 
the crm department also has responsibility for portfolio management of counterparty credit risks 
this includes monitoring and reporting large exposures current credit exposure and maximum potential exposure and concentrations across countries  industries and products  as well as ensuring risk ratings are current and performing asset quality portfolio trend analyses 
our chief risk officer is a member of the investment banking commitment  investment and bridge loan approval committees 
members of credit and market risk management participate in committee meetings  vetting and reviewing transactions 
decisions on approving transactions not only take into account the creditworthiness of the transaction on a stand alone basis  but they also consider our aggregate obligor risk  portfolio concentrations  reputation risk and  importantly  the impact any particular transaction under consideration would have on our overall risk appetite 
exceptional transactions and or situations are addressed and discussed with senior management including  when appropriate  the executive committee 
see critical accounting policies and estimates derivatives and other contractual agreements in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about net credit exposure on otc derivative contracts 
market risk market risk represents the potential change in value of a portfolio of financial instruments due to changes in market rates  prices and volatilities 
market risk management also is an essential component of our overall risk management framework 
the market risk management department the mrm department has global responsibility for developing and implementing our overall market risk management framework 
to that end  it is responsible for developing the policies and procedures of the market risk management process  determining the market risk measurement methodology in conjunction with the quantitative risk management department the qrm department  monitoring  reporting and analyzing the aggregate market risk of trading exposures  administering market risk limits and the escalation process  and communicating large or unusual risks as appropriate 
market risks inherent in positions include  but are not limited to  interest rate  equity and foreign exchange exposures 
the mrm department uses qualitative as well as quantitative information in managing trading risk  believing a combination of the two approaches results in a more robust and complete approach to the management of trading risk 
quantitative information is developed from a variety of risk methodologies based on established statistical principles

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ensure high standards of analysis  the mrm department has retained seasoned risk managers with the requisite experience and academic and professional credentials 
market risk is present in cash products  derivatives and contingent claim structures that exhibit linear as well as non linear price behavior 
our exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the volume of client driven market making transactions  the size of our proprietary positions and the volatility of financial instruments traded 
we seek to mitigate  whenever possible  excess market risk exposures through appropriate hedging strategies 
we participate globally in interest rate  equity and foreign exchange markets and  beginning in  commodity markets 
our fixed income division has a broadly diversified market presence in us and foreign government bond trading  emerging market securities  corporate debt investment and non investment grade  money market instruments  mortgages and mortgage and asset backed securities  real estate  municipal bonds and interest rate derivatives 
our equities division facilitates domestic and foreign trading in equity instruments  indices and related derivatives 
our foreign exchange businesses are involved in trading currencies on a spot and forward basis as well as through derivative products and contracts 
we incur short term interest rate risk in the course of facilitating the orderly flow of client transactions through the maintenance of government and other bond inventories 
market making in high grade corporate bonds and high yield instruments exposes us to additional risk due to potential variations in credit spreads 
trading in international markets exposes us to spread risk between the term structure of interest rates in different countries 
mortgages and mortgage related securities are subject to prepayment risk 
trading in derivatives and structured products exposes us to changes in the volatility of interest rates 
we actively manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate futures  options  swaps  forwards and offsetting cash market instruments 
inventory holdings  concentrations and agings are monitored closely and used by management to selectively hedge or liquidate undesirable exposures 
we are a significant intermediary in the global equity markets through our market making in us and us equity securities and derivatives  including common stock  convertible debt  exchange traded and otc equity options  equity swaps and warrants 
these activities expose us to market risk as a result of equity price and volatility changes 
inventory holdings also are subject to market risk resulting from concentrations and changes in liquidity conditions that may adversely affect market valuations 
equity market risk is actively managed through the use of index futures  exchange traded and otc options  swaps and cash instruments 
we enter into foreign exchange transactions through our market making activities 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk on our holdings of non dollar assets and liabilities 
we are active in many foreign exchange markets and have exposure to the euro  japanese yen  british pound  swiss franc and canadian dollar  as well as a variety of developed and emerging market currencies 
we hedge our risk exposures primarily through the use of currency forwards  swaps  futures and options 
if any of the strategies used to hedge or otherwise mitigate exposures to the various types of risks described above are not effective  we could incur losses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our use of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate  currency  equity and other market risks 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
we face operational risk arising from mistakes made in the execution  confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted for 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies  and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
consequently  we rely heavily on our financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
in recent years  we have substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other operating technology  and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade and expand in the future to avoid disruption of  or constraints on  our operations 
operational risk management the orm department is responsible for implementing and maintaining our overall global operational risk management framework  which seeks to minimize these risks through assessing  reporting  monitoring and mitigating operational risks 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have a company wide business continuity plan bcp plan 
the bcp plan objective is to ensure that we can continue critical operations with limited processing interruption in the event of a business disruption 
the bcp group manages our internal incident response process and develops and maintains continuity plans for critical business functions and infrastructure 
this includes determining how vital business activities will be performed until normal processing capabilities can be restored 
the bcp group is also responsible for facilitating disaster recovery and business continuity training and preparedness for our employees 
reputational risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
potential clients are screened through a multi step process that begins with the individual business units and product groups 
in screening clients  these groups undertake a comprehensive review of the client and its background and the potential transaction to determine  among other things  whether they pose any risks to our reputation 
potential transactions are screened by independent committees in the firm  which are composed of senior members from various corporate divisions of the company including members of the global risk management division 
these committees review the nature of the client and its business  the due diligence conducted by the business units and product groups and the proposed terms of the transaction to determine overall acceptability of the proposed transaction 
in doing so  the committees evaluate the appropriateness of the transaction  including a consideration of ethical and social responsibility issues and the potential effect of the transaction on our reputation 
value at risk value at risk var measures the potential mark to market loss over a specified time horizon and is expressed at a given confidence level 
we report an empirical var calculated based upon the distribution of actual trading revenue 
we consider var based on net revenue volatility to be a comprehensive risk measurement tool because it incorporates virtually all of our trading activities and types of risk including market  credit and event risks 
the table below presents var for each component of risk using historical daily net trading revenues 
under this method  we estimate a reporting daily var using actual daily net trading revenues over the previous trading days 
such var is measured as the loss  relative to the median daily trading net revenue  at a confidence level 
this means there is a in chance that such loss on a particular day could exceed the reported var number 
value at risk revenue volatility year ended november var at november in millions average high low average high low interest rate risk equity price risk foreign exchange risk diversification benefit average var for of million increased from million for the comparable period reflecting the increased scale of our fixed income and equity capital markets businesses  as well as a lower diversification benefit across these businesses 
var based on net revenue volatility is just one tool we use in evaluating firmwide risk 
another risk measurement tool is a model based approach  using end of day positions  and modeling market risk  counterparty credit risk and event risk 
using this model based approach  our average firmwide risk for declined compared with  primarily due to reduced event risk  partially offset by slightly higher market risk 
the market risk component of the model based risk measurement approach is based on a historical simulation var using end of day positions to determine the revenue loss at a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
specifically  the historical simulation approach involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations value of our financial instruments based on risk factors embedded in the current portfolio and historical observations of daily changes in these risk factors 
our method uses four years of historical data weighted to give greater impact to more recent time periods in simulating potential changes in market risk factors 
it is implicit in a historical simulation var methodology that positions will have offsetting risk characteristics  referred to as diversification benefit 
we measure the diversification benefit within our portfolio of financial instruments by historically simulating how the positions in our current portfolio would have behaved in relation to each other as opposed to using a static estimate of a diversification benefit  which remains relatively constant from period to period 
thus  from time to time there will be changes in our historical simulation var due to changes in the diversification benefit across our portfolio of financial instruments 
historical simulation var was million at november   up from million at november  primarily attributable to higher equity price risk and a lower diversification benefit 
average historical simulation var was million for  up from million in reflecting the increased scale of our fixed income and equity capital markets businesses as well as a lower diversification benefit in relative terms 
as with any predictive model  var measures have inherent limitations  and we could incur losses greater than the var reported above 
these limitations include historical market conditions and historical changes in market risk factors may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions or future market risk factors and var measurements are based on current positions  while future risk depends on future positions 
in addition  a one day historical simulation var does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day 
in addition  because there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  different assumptions and methodologies could produce materially different results and therefore caution should be used when comparing such risk measures across firms 
we believe our methods and assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable and prudent 
distribution of daily net revenues substantially all of the company s inventory positions are marked to market daily with changes recorded in net revenues 
the following chart sets forth the frequency distribution for daily net revenues for our capital markets and investment management business segments excluding asset management fees for the years ended november  and as discussed throughout this md a  we seek to reduce risk through the diversification of our businesses and a focus on client flow activities 
this diversification and focus  combined with our risk management controls and processes  helps mitigate the net revenue volatility inherent in our trading activities 
although historical performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance  we believe our focus on business diversification and client flow activities should continue to reduce the volatility of future net trading revenues

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations daily trading net revenues graphic in both and  daily trading net revenues did not exceed losses of million on any single day 
critical accounting policies and estimates generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management estimates are required in determining the valuation of inventory positions  particularly over the counter otc derivatives  certain commercial mortgage loans and investments in real estate  certain high yield positions  private equity and other principal investments  and non investment grade retained interests 
additionally  significant management estimates are required in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business acquisition  the accounting treatment of qspes and vies  the outcome of litigation  the fair value of equity based compensation awards and determining the allocation of the cost of acquired businesses to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and determining the amount of the real estate reconfiguration charges 
management believes the estimates used in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of these and other accounting policies 
fair value the determination of fair value is a critical accounting policy that is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations 
we record financial instruments classified as financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased at market or fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
in all instances  we believe we have established rigorous internal control processes to ensure we use reasonable and prudent measurements of fair value on a consistent basis 
when evaluating the extent to which estimates may be required in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities reflected in our financial statements  we believe it is useful to analyze the balance sheet as shown in the following table lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary balance sheet in millions november  assets financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  securities received as collateral  collateralized agreements  cash  receivables and pp e  other assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  total assets  liabilities and equity financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased  obligation to return securities received as collateral  collateralized financing  payables and other accrued liabilities  total capital  total liabilities and equity  total capital includes long term borrowings including junior subordinated notes and total stockholders equity  and at november  and prior year ends  preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
we adopted fin r effective february   which required us to deconsolidate trusts that issue preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
accordingly  at february  and subsequent period ends  long term borrowings include junior subordinated notes that at november  and prior period ends  were classified as preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption 
we believe total capital is useful to investors as a measure of our financial strength because it aggregates our long term funding sources 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are recorded at amounts for which significant management estimates are not used 
the following balance sheet categories  comprising of total assets and of total liabilities and equity  are valued either at historical cost or at contract value including accrued interest which  by their nature  do not require the use of significant estimates collateralized agreements  cash  receivables and pp e  collateralized financing  payables and other accrued liabilities and total capital 
securities received as collateral and obligation to return securities received as collateral are recorded at fair value  but due to their offsetting nature do not result in fair value estimates affecting the consolidated statement of income 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased long and short inventory positions  respectively  are recorded at market or fair value  the components of which may require  to varying degrees  the use of estimates in determining fair value 
when evaluating the extent to which management estimates may be used in determining the fair value for long and short inventory  we believe it is useful to consider separately derivatives and cash instruments 
derivatives and other contractual agreements 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included within these amounts were exchange traded derivative assets and liabilities of billion and billion  respectively  for which fair value is determined based on quoted market prices 
the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities at november  were billion and billion  respectively 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth the fair value of otc derivatives by contract type and by remaining contractual maturity fair value of otc derivative contracts by maturity in millions november  less than year to years to years greater than years cross maturity and cash collateral netting otc derivatives net credit exposure assets interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options  foreign exchange forward contracts and options   other fixed income securities contracts  equity contracts     liabilities interest rate  currency and credit default swaps and options  foreign exchange forward contracts and options   other fixed income securities contracts  equity contracts     cross maturity netting represents the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across maturity and product categories 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same maturity category are netted within the maturity category when appropriate 
cash collateral received or paid is netted on a counterparty basis  provided legal right of offset exists 
assets and liabilities at november  were netted down for cash collateral of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
presented below is an analysis of net credit exposure at november  for otc contracts based on actual ratings made by external rating agencies or by equivalent ratings established and used by our credit risk management department 
net credit exposure counterparty risk rating less than year greater than years total s p moody s equivalent to years to years iaaa aaa aaa iaa aa aa ia a a ibbb bbb baa ibb bb ba ib or lower b b or lower the majority of our otc derivatives are transacted in liquid trading markets for which fair value is determined using pricing models with readily observable market inputs 
examples of such derivatives include interest rate swap contracts  tbas  foreign exchange forward and option contracts in g currencies and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities 
however  the determination of fair value of certain less liquid derivatives required the use of significant estimates 
such derivatives include certain credit derivatives  equity option contracts with terms greater than five years  and certain other complex derivatives we provide to clients 
we strive to limit the use of significant estimates by using lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consistent pricing assumptions between reporting periods and using observed market data for model inputs whenever possible 
as the market for complex products develops  we refine our pricing models based on market experience to use the most current indicators of fair value 
cash instruments 
the majority of our non derivative long and short inventory ie  cash instruments is recorded at market value based on listed market prices or using third party broker quotes and therefore does not incorporate significant estimates 
examples of inventory valued in this manner include government securities  agency mortgage backed securities  listed equities  money market instruments  municipal securities and corporate bonds 
however  in certain instances we may deem such quotations to be unrealizable eg  when the instruments are thinly traded or when we hold a substantial block of a particular security such that the listed price is not deemed to be readily realizable 
in such instances  we determine fair value based on  among other factors  management s best estimate giving appropriate consideration to reported prices and the extent of public trading in similar securities  the discount from the listed price associated with the cost at date of acquisition and the size of the position held in relation to the liquidity in the market 
when the size of our holding of a listed security is likely to impair our ability to realize the quoted market price  we record the position at a discount to the quoted price reflecting our best estimate of fair value 
when quoted prices are not available  fair value is determined based on pricing models or other valuation techniques  including the use of implied pricing from similar instruments 
pricing models typically are used to derive fair value based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows including adjustments  when appropriate  for liquidity  credit and or other factors 
for the vast majority of instruments valued through pricing models  significant estimates are not required because the market inputs to such models are readily observable and liquid trading markets provide clear evidence to support the valuations derived from such pricing models 
examples of inventory valued using pricing models or other valuation techniques for which the use of management estimates are necessary include certain mortgages and mortgage backed positions  real estate inventory  non investment grade retained interests  certain derivative and other contractual agreements  as well as certain high yield and certain private equity and other principal investments 
mortgages  mortgage backed and real estate inventory positions 
mortgages and mortgage backed positions include mortgage loans both residential and commercial  non agency mortgage backed securities and real estate investments 
we are a market leader in mortgage backed securities trading 
we originate residential and commercial mortgage loans as part of our mortgage trading and securitization activities 
we originated approximately billion and billion of residential mortgage loans in and  respectively 
we securitized approximately billion and billion of residential mortgage loans in and  respectively  including both originated loans and those we acquired in the secondary market 
in addition  we originated approximately billion and billion of commercial mortgage loans in and  respectively  the majority of which has been sold through securitization or syndicate activities during both and see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our securitization activities 
we record mortgage loans at fair value  with related mark to market gains and losses recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
management estimates are generally not required in determining the fair value of residential mortgage loans because these positions are securitized frequently 
certain commercial mortgage loans and investments  due to their less liquid nature  may require management estimates in determining fair value 
fair value for these positions is generally based on analyses of both cash flow projections and underlying property values 
we use independent appraisals to support our assessment of the property in determining fair value for these positions 
fair value for approximately billion and billion at november  and  respectively  of our total mortgage loan inventory is determined using the above valuation methodologies  which may involve the use of significant estimates 
because a portion of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position is limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
we invest in real estate through direct investments in equity and debt 
we record real estate held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value 
the assessment of fair value generally requires the use of management estimates and generally is based on property appraisals provided by third parties and also incorporates an analysis of the related property cash flow projections 
we had real estate investments of approximately billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
because significant portions of these assets have been financed on a non recourse basis  our net investment position was limited to billion and billion at november  and  respectively 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations high yield 
we underwrite  invest and make markets in high yield corporate debt securities 
we also syndicate  trade and invest in loans to below investment grade rated companies 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield debt instruments are defined as securities of or loans to companies rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies  as well as non rated securities or loans that  in management s opinion  are non investment grade 
non investment grade securities generally involve greater risks than investment grade securities due to the issuer s creditworthiness and the lower liquidity of the market for such securities 
in addition  these issuers generally have relatively higher levels of indebtedness resulting in an increased sensitivity to adverse economic conditions 
we recognize these risks and seek to reduce market and credit risk through the diversification of our products and counterparties 
high yield debt instruments are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income 
such instruments at november  and included long positions with an aggregate fair value of approximately billion at both periods 
at november  and  the largest industry concentrations were and  respectively  categorized within the finance and insurance and manufacturing industrial classifications  respectively 
the largest geographic concentrations at november  and were and  respectively  in the united states 
the majority of these positions are valued using broker quotes or listed market prices 
however  at november  and november   approximately million and million  respectively  of these positions were valued using other valuation techniques because there was little or no trading activity 
in such instances  we use prudent judgment in determining fair value  which may involve using analyses of credit spreads associated with pricing of similar instruments  or other valuation techniques 
we mitigate our aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives  non recourse financing and other financial instruments 
private equity and other principal investments 
our private equity business operates in five major asset classes merchant banking  real estate  venture capital  fixed income related investments and private funds investments 
we have raised privately placed funds in all of these classes  for which we act as general partner and in which we have general and in some cases limited partner interests 
in addition  we generally co invest in the investments made by the funds or may make other non fund related direct investments 
we carry our private equity investments  including our partnership interests  at fair value based on our assessment of each underlying investment 
at november  and  our private equity related investments totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the real estate industry represented the highest concentrations at and at november  and november   respectively  and the largest single investment exposures were million and million  at those respective dates 
the determination of fair value for these investments often requires the use of estimates and assumptions because these investments generally are less liquid and often contain trading restrictions 
at november  and november   we estimate that approximately million and million  respectively  of these investments have readily determinable fair values because they are publicly traded securities with limited remaining trading restrictions 
for the remainder of these positions  fair value is based on our assessment of the underlying investments incorporating valuations that consider expected cash flows  earnings multiples and or comparisons to similar market transactions 
valuation adjustments  which may involve the use of significant management estimates  are an integral part of pricing these instruments  reflecting consideration of credit quality  concentration risk  sale restrictions and other liquidity factors 
additional information about our private equity and other principal investment activities  including related commitments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
non investment grade retained interests 
we held approximately million and million of non investment grade retained interests at november  and  respectively 
because these interests primarily represent the junior interests in securitizations for which there are not active trading markets  estimates generally are required in determining fair value 
we value these instruments using prudent estimates of expected cash flows and consider the valuation of similar transactions in the market 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adverse changes in assumptions on the fair value of these interests 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in october we acquired neuberger for a net purchase price of approximately billion  including equity consideration of billion and cash consideration and incremental costs of billion  and excluding cash and short term investments acquired of approximately million 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired which included certain intangible assets was recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair values and useful lives of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed associated with business acquisitions intangible assets in particular requires significant judgment 
in addition  we are required to assess for lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually using fair value measurement techniques 
periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible assets with indefinite lives involves significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such a charge 
we completed our last goodwill impairment test as of august   and no impairment was identified 
spes the company is a market leader in securitization transactions  including securitizations of residential and commercial loans  municipal bonds and other asset backed transactions 
the vast majority of such securitization transactions are designed to be in conformity with the sfas requirements of a qspe 
securitization transactions meeting the requirements of a qspe are deemed to be off balance sheet 
the assessment of whether a securitization vehicle meets the accounting requirements of a qspe requires significant judgment  particularly in evaluating whether servicing agreements meet the conditions of a permitted activities under sfas and whether or not derivatives are considered to be passive 
in addition  the evaluation of whether an entity is subject to the requirements of finr as a variable interest entity vie and the determination of whether the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such vie is a critical accounting policy that requires significant management judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company s accounting policies 
real estate reconfiguration charges in connection with our decision to reconfigure certain of our global real estate facilities  we recognized real estate reconfiguration charges in and the recognition of these charges required significant management estimates including estimates of the vacancy periods prior to subleasing  the anticipated rates of subleases and the amounts of incentives eg  free rent periods that may be required to induce sub lessees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the real estate reconfiguration charges 
legal reserves in the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings 
such proceedings include actions brought against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor  actions arising out of our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and commodities and actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants against many securities firms  including us 
in addition  our business activities are reviewed by various taxing authorities around the world with regard to corporate income tax rules and regulations 
we provide for potential losses that may arise out of legal  regulatory and tax proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated 
accounting and regulatory developments fsp fas in december  the fasb issued fsp fas accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  fsp fas which provides guidance on the accounting implications of the american jobs creation act of the act related to the one time tax benefit for the repatriation of foreign earnings 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we have reviewed the act to determine the implications of repatriating all or a portion of our accumulated non us retained earnings pool and determined that we would not generate any material tax benefits associated with the act  as any amounts able to be repatriated under the act would not be material 
sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  which we will adopt on december  sfas r requires public companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments granted to employees 
expense is to be recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
lehman brothers holdings inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sfas r also clarifies and expands the guidance in sfas in several areas  including measuring fair value and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods 
under the modified prospective transition method applied in the adoption of sfas r  compensation cost will be recognized for the unamortized portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas upon adoption of sfas r on december   we will recognize an after tax gain of approximately million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  primarily attributable to the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred 
we do not expect adoption of sfas r otherwise will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r generally requires equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees  and those employees with non substantive non compete agreements to be expensed immediately 
for stock based awards granted prior to our adoption of sfas r compensation cost for retirement eligible employees and employees subject to non compete agreements  is recognized over the service period specified in the award 
we accelerate the recognition of compensation cost if and when a retirement eligible employee or an employee subject to a non compete agreement leaves the company 
the following table sets forth the pro forma net income that would have been reported for the years ended november   and if equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees  and those with non substantive non compete agreements had been expensed immediately as required by sfas r pro forma net income in millions year ended november net income  as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income  net of related tax effect deduct stock based employee compensation expense  net of related tax effect  determined under sfas r pro forma net income    eitf issue no

as the general partner of numerous private equity  merchant banking and asset management partnerships  we adopted eitf immediately for partnerships formed or modified after june  for partnerships formed on or before june  that have not been modified  we are required to adopt eitf on december  in a manner similar to a cumulative effect type adjustment or by retrospective application 
we do not expect adoption of eitf for partnerships formed on or before june  that have not been modified will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated supervised entity 
in june  the sec approved a rule establishing a voluntary framework for comprehensive  group wide risk management procedures and consolidated supervision of certain financial services holding companies 
the framework is designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory burdens on us securities firms resulting from the european union the eu directive ec concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the eu 
the rule also allows companies to use an alternative method  based on internal risk models  to calculate net capital charges for market and derivative related credit risk 
under this rule  the sec will regulate the holding company and any unregulated affiliated registered broker dealer pursuant to an undertaking to be provided by the holding company  including subjecting the holding company to capital requirements generally consistent with the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards published by the basel committee on banking supervision 
on november  the sec approved our application to become a consolidated supervised entity cse effective december  as of december   holdings became regulated by the sec as a cse
