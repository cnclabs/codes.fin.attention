item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global specialty pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products 
we focus our greatest resources and attention principally in the therapeutic areas of neurology  infectious disease and dermatology 
our marketing and promotion efforts focus on our promoted products  which are seven marketed global brands and a portfolio of selected promoted regional and local products with annual sales in excess of million 
our products are currently sold in more than markets around the world  with our primary focus on ten key geographic regions the united states  canada  mexico  the united kingdom  france  italy  poland  germany  spain and china 
our two primary value drivers are a specialty pharmaceutical business with a global platform  and a research and development infrastructure with strong discovery  clinical development and regulatory capabilities 
we believe that our global reach and fully integrated research and development capability make us unique among specialty pharmaceutical companies  and provide us with the ability to take compounds from discovery through the clinical stage and commercialize them in major markets around the world 
in addition  we receive royalties from the sale of ribavirin by schering plough and roche  although such royalties currently represent a much smaller contribution to our revenues than they have in the past 
specialty pharmaceuticals product sales from our specialty pharmaceuticals segment accounted for of our total revenues from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  and increased million in the year ended december  compared to the increase in specialty pharmaceutical product sales was due to an increase in volume of approximately  an approximate increase due to changes in selling prices and an approximate favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
sales of new products that we acquired in the xcel acquisition in march contributed million to the increase 
excluding the products acquired from xcel  specialty pharmaceutical sales grew in our current product portfolio comprises approximately branded products  with approximately  stock keeping units 
we market our products globally through a marketing and sales force consisting of approximately  employees 
we focus our sales  marketing and promotion efforts on the promoted products within our product portfolio 
we have identified these promoted products as offering the best potential return on investment 
the majority of our promoted products are in our three targeted therapeutic areas 
promoted products in other therapeutic areas have characteristics and regional or local market positions that also offer superior growth and returns on marketing investments 
our future growth is expected to be driven primarily by the commercialization of new products  growth of our existing products  and business development 
our promoted products accounted for and of our specialty pharmaceutical product sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our promoted products increased million in the year ended december  compared to this increase includes million from two new products which we added in as a result of our acquisition of xcel 
excluding these acquired products  sales of promoted products increased million or in the year ended december  compared to our increased sales of promoted products were partially offset by declines in non promoted products 
we have experienced generic challenges and other competition to our products  as well as pricing challenges through government imposed price controls and reductions  and expect these challenges to continue in and beyond 
ribavirin royalties ribavirin royalty revenues increased million in over the increase in royalties relates to sales in japan where the ministry of health  labor and welfare approved the prescribing of ribavirin in combination with pegylated interferon for hepatitis c patients in december ribavirin royalties 
table of contents accounted for of our total revenues from continuing operations in both and ribavirin royalty revenues decreased million in as compared to the decline in ribavirin royalty revenues since  and the decreasing contribution of royalties to our revenues  had been expected with the entry of generic ribavirin in the united states 
we expect future ribavirin royalties to be somewhat stable for several years since generics are unlikely to enter the major european countries and japanese markets due to certain protections in those markets through and  respectively 
however  we would expect to see declines as a result of the introduction viramidine taribavirin when and if approved or from the introduction of other alternative therapies 
research and development valeant s scientific innovations are defined and supported by an international r d staff of approximately professionals 
our efforts focused on antiviral development have resulted in significant accomplishments since we have advanced two compounds taribavirin and remofovir into clinical development and created significant value to our company 
over the past five years  our company has invested significant capital and resources to modernize our laboratories and establish a world class state of the art r d capability 
a cross functional and fully integrated drug discovery infrastructure has been established among multi disciplinary scientists to ensure that relevant targets are selected and tractable drug candidates with sound mechanisms of action are moved rapidly through the pipeline 
we have created a multi parametric system to evaluate efficacy  safety  drug metabolism and compound enabling formulation 
our current research and development emphasis is to discover and develop novel compounds with best in class potential for the treatment of viral diseases and cancers 
we possess one of the largest nucleoside analog compound libraries in the world with more than  nucleosides 
additionally  we have amassed a library of more than  non nucleoside and diverse compounds 
our drug discovery programs are highly competitive and cover the therapeutic areas discussed below  encompassing three of the most significant viral diseases in man 
we are developing a pipeline of product candidates  including three clinical stage programs  viramidine taribavirin  pradefovir formerly called remofovir and retigabine  which target large market opportunities 
taribavirin is a pro drug of ribavirin  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c in treatment naive patients in conjunction with a pegylated interferon 
we are developing pradefovir as an oral once a day monotherapy for patients with chronic hepatitis b infection 
with the acquisition of xcel in march  another product candidate  retigabine  has been added to our pipeline 
retigabine is being developed as an adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in chronic hepatitis b currently  nearly million people  approximately six percent of the world s population  suffer from chronic hepatitis b infection and face a significant likelihood of developing cirrhotic liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma 
the current nucleoside nucleotide analog and interferon treatments rarely achieve complete eradication of the virus and a cure of the disease 
better therapeutics and treatment strategies are needed to increase potency  provide activity against treatment refractory viruses and improve efficacy in all chronic hepatitis b populations 
to meet these challenges  our hepatitis b discovery program focuses on the development of non nucleoside  small molecule inhibitors of hepatitis b virus hbv 
we hope to complement the current nucleoside nucleotide analog and immunomodulatory therapies with an antiviral drug that will greatly improve the clinical outcome of treatment for chronic hepatitis b patients as well as shorten the duration of treatment 
using a high throughput cell based screening system  we have identified lead compounds which are potent inhibitors of hbv replication in vitro 
these compounds are effective against the lm mv and 
table of contents mi drug resistant viruses in cell culture 
medicinal chemistry structure activity relationship sar studies are ongoing to optimize these leads for potency  selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties 
based on lessons learned from hiv aids therapies  we envision that these non nucleoside inhibitors may further improve the efficacy of those nucleoside inhibitors such as pradefovir  our anti hbv compound currently under phase clinical development by valeant 
chronic hepatitis c worldwide  approximately million individuals are infected with hcv 
in the united states alone  million individuals are infected 
current therapies consist of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin with a sustained virological response ranging as high as to 
the goal of the hcv research program at valeant is to identify and develop novel drug candidates against hcv 
our approach is to utilize an in house proprietary compound collection  a high throughput screening hts program and our expertise in virology and nucleoside chemistry  coupled with an antiviral drug development capability  to identify and optimize potent inhibitors of hcv replication 
both nucleoside and non nucleoside based small molecule inhibitors are being pursued 
we are selecting candidates that may have the potential to offer clear therapeutic advantages over the currently approved treatments for chronic hepatitis c 
to date  lead compounds with the potential for potent anti hcv activity have been identified through parallel antiviral screening 
we are currently optimizing these compounds for potency and selectivity as well as pharmacokinetic properties 
we believe that these novel compounds in combination with the current standard of care therapies have the potential to achieve curative responses in a greater proportion of hcv patients 
hiv aids an important aspect of the fight against hiv aids is to offer physicians a large variety of medicines  thus allowing them to individualize their patient s treatment 
there are currently more than products approved by the fda for the treatment of hiv aids in the united states nine protease inhibitors pis  eight nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis  three non nucleoside inhibitors nnrtis and one fusion inhibitor 
combination therapies are used to treat hiv infected patients with drugs from several categories concurrently  giving them a better chance of survival 
however  many patients have developed resistance to the current hiv treatments  resulting in a lack of efficacy of multiple drug regimens  including highly active antiretroviral therapy haart 
factors that contribute to incomplete suppression of viral replication and the development of resistance include sub optimal potency of the treatment regimens  drug drug interactions or poor pharmacokinetics  and non adherence to the hiv treatment due to side effects 
valeant s hiv drug discovery program seeks to address the issues related to drug resistance and complex treatment regimens 
scientists have discovered that one key to improving the antiviral activities of nnrtis on viruses with a mutated reverse transcriptase rt is to build flexible molecules that adapt to the changes in the nnrti binding pocket of the enzyme 
by designing compounds that are adaptive to these conformational changes  we are able to obtain a high degree of antiviral potency against most clinical isolates resistant to current nnrtis 
our program has produced several developmental candidates with these novel characteristics 
in january of  we successfully submitted an ind to fda on one of the lead compounds  vrx kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancers and immune disorders in the us alone  cancer causes more than  deaths each year 
in addition  millions of people around the world suffer from diseases caused by inflammation  including rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  asthma and various other life altering diseases 
current therapies for both of these diseases have dramatic side effects due to cytotoxic or immunosuppressive characteristics of the drugs 

table of contents recently  the pathways involved in cancer progression and inflammatory diseases have become clearer 
it is now known that kinases play an important role in the control of many cellular functions 
the key reaction catalyzed by kinases is the addition of phosphate groups at specific sites on selected proteins 
this single event  which is activated by the kinase  can be propagated via signal transduction pathways into major changes in the overall behavior of the cell 
alterations in kinase activity have been implicated in most major diseases  including cancer and inflammatory  autoimmune  cardiovascular  metabolic  and neurological diseases 
in particular  specific kinases are critically involved in the cellular processes that mediate  exacerbate or maintain the inflammatory responses and that promote cancer cell survival 
by targeting specific kinases involved at key points in these pathways  several small molecules have been developed by a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as therapeutics in the past few years 
the control of selective pathways by this class of therapeutics alleviates some of the side effects of previous less or non selective therapies 
at valeant  we have initiated several projects targeting specific kinases using our cutting edge structure based drug design platform to identify potential drug candidates for treating cancer or inflammatory diseases 
our in house signal transduction expertise allows valeant to effectively identify at a very early stage selective  potent  novel drug candidates with desirable cellular disease modifying responses 
several lead candidates are under preclinical development 
company strategy following a change in management leadership in  a three part plan was initiated to restructure our company  transform the business and grow through innovation 
we have made significant progress in the execution of this plan  including completion of our restructuring phase that entailed a divestiture program  the restructuring of our management team  the implementation of strong governance protocols and the strengthening of our research and development capability 
the key elements of our strategy include the following targeted growth of existing products 
we focus our business on ten key geographic regions  across three core therapeutic areas 
we believe that our core therapeutic areas are positioned for further growth and that it is possible for a mid sized company to attain a leadership position within these categories 
furthermore  we believe that our global brands and promoted products have the potential for penetration and above industry average growth rates 
in addition  we intend to continue to market and sell  and selectively pursue life cycle management strategies for  our regional and local brands 
efficient manufacturing and supply chain organization 
under our global manufacturing strategy  we have reduced the number of manufacturing facilities in order to increase capacity utilization and improve efficiencies 
we have also undertaken a major process improvement initiative  affecting all phases of our operations  from raw material and supply logistics  to manufacturing  warehousing and distribution 
we have made significant progress towards our plans of disposing of certain manufacturing sites 
as of december  we have disposed of eight facilities 
we are marketing other sites to prospective buyers 
the sites scheduled for disposition were tested for impairment  resulting in impairment of asset value on four of the sites 
accordingly  we wrote these sites down to their fair value and recorded impairment charges of million in and million in in addition  to the impairment charge  we recorded million in restructuring and impairment charges related to severance for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the manufacturing restructuring plan 
in january  the parent company of one of our toll manufacturers in europe filed for bankruptcy 
sales of products obtained from this manufacturer are estimated to be approximately million in the supplier has developed a business plan to continue to successfully operate and we have developed plans to respond to a disruption should it occur 
to date this bankruptcy filing has had no affect on our operations and the supplier continues to operate and meet its commitments to supply us with products 
development of new products via internal research and development activities 
we seek to discover  develop and commercialize innovative products for the treatment of medical needs which are significantly under addressed  principally in the areas of infectious disease and cancer 
we intend to 
table of contents combine our scientific expertise with advanced drug screening techniques in order to discover and develop new product candidates 
product acquisitions 
we plan to selectively license or acquire product candidates  technologies and businesses from third parties which complement our existing business and provide for effective life cycle management of key products 
we believe that our drug development expertise will allow us to recognize licensing opportunities and to capitalize on research initially conducted and funded by others 
acquisitions we made the following acquisitions in on march   we acquired xcel  a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system  for million in cash  plus expenses of approximately million 
xcel s portfolio consists of four products that are sold within the united states  and retigabine  a late stage clinical product candidate that is an adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures for patients with epilepsy  which is being developed for commercialization in all major markets 
we recently filed a claim for indemnification from the former xcel stockholders with respect to certain breaches of representation and warranties made by xcel under the xcel purchase agreement and certain third party claims 
as of december   approximately million of the xcel purchase price remained in an escrow fund to pay indemnification claims 
in the third quarter of we acquired product rights to melleril in brazil and acurenal in poland for cash consideration of million 
we recorded sales of million for these two products in on december   we acquired the us and canadian rights to infergen from intermune 
infergen is indicated for the treatment of hepatitis c when patients have not responded to other treatments primarily the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin or have relapsed after such treatment 
in connection with this transaction we acquired patent rights and rights to a clinical trial underway to expand applications of infergen 
we also employed intermune s marketing and research staffs who were dedicated to the infergen product and projects 
we paid intermune consideration of million in cash at the closing 
we have also agreed to pay intermune up to an additional million  million of which is dependent on reaching certain milestones 
additionally  as part of the acquisition transaction we assumed a contract for the transfer of the manufacturing process for infergen from one third party supplier to another 
under the contract we are obligated to pay the new third party supplier up to million upon the attainment of separate milestones tied to the manufacturing process transfer 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these acquisitions 
results of operations we have four reportable specialty pharmaceutical segments comprising our pharmaceuticals operations in north america  latin america  europe and asia  africa and australia aaa 
in addition  we have a research and development division 
certain financial information for our business segments is set forth below 
this discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document

approximately of our total pharmaceutical revenues resulted from sales of promoted products in we define promoted products as being those that we promote with annual sales of greater than million 
worldwide sales of promoted products totaled million in  an increase of million or over approximately million of this increase in promoted product sales consisted of two new products acquired in the xcel transaction 
sales of other promoted products in increased million or 
table of contents over sales levels 
the increased sales in promoted products and those resulting from the acquisition of xcel were partially offset by declines in sales of non promoted products 
in our north america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  increased million over the increase reflects the inclusion of sales of products acquired from xcel in march million 
the increase also reflects higher sales of promoted products other than those acquired in the xcel transaction which totaled million in an increase of million over sales levels 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of non promoted products 
in our latin america pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  increased million 
the increase was primarily due to a reduction in discounts offered to distributors in the region aggregating million 
revenues from bedoyecta  which is our highest revenue product in mexico  were million in  an increase of million over reflecting a successful direct to consumer marketing campaign 
sales of other promoted products in the region totaled million in an increase of million over those in the increases in revenues were partially offset by volume decreases in sales of non promoted products 
in our european pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million 
the increase in the value of currencies in the region relative to the us dollar contributed million to the increase in revenues in the region in sales of promoted products in were million compared to million in an increase of million 
the increases in revenues from higher promoted product sales and exchange rate fluctuations were offset by reductions in sales of non promoted products 
sales in many parts of europe were also negatively affected by pricing policies imposed by governmental authorities 
in our asia  africa and australia aaa pharmaceuticals segment  revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase reflects higher sales volumes across most products sold in the region 
sales of promoted products in this region totaled million in  an increase of million over sales in ribavirin royalties ribavirin royalties from schering plough and roche for the year ended december  were million compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase primarily resulted from increased sales in japan where the ministry of health  labor and welfare approved the marketing of ribavirin in combination with peg intron for the treatment of hepatitis c 
the and royalty amounts are significantly less than amounts received in and prior years 
the decrease in ribavirin royalties reflect the effects of the launch of generic ribavirin in the united states and competition between schering plough and roche 
approval of a generic form of oral ribavirin by the fda in the united states was announced in april competition from generic pharmaceutical companies has had  and continues to have  a material negative impact on our royalty revenue 
with respect to schering plough  in some markets royalty rates increase in tiers based on increased sales levels in the united states 
upon the entry of generics into the united states in april  pursuant to the terms of their contract  roche ceased paying royalties on sales in the united states 
schering plough has also launched a generic version of ribavirin 
under the license and supply agreement  schering plough is obligated to pay us royalties for sales of their generic ribavirin 
gross profit margin the increase in gross profit margin in is largely due to an increase in sales in the north america region  which generates higher profit margins  and to greater efficiencies in our global 
table of contents manufacturing and supply chain operations 
gross profit calculations exclude amortization which is discussed below 
gross profits by segment are as follows increase year ended december  decrease dollar amounts in thousands gross profits speciality pharmaceutucals only north america of product sales latin america of product sales europe of product sales asia  africa  australia of product sales consolidated gross profits of product sales selling expenses selling expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of million 
as a percent of product sales  selling expenses were for the years ended december  and included in selling expenses for the year ended december  and were severance charges of million and million  respectively  related to a sales force restructuring in europe 
the increase in selling expenses reflects our increased promotional efforts primarily in north america and latin america and includes costs related to new product launches and unified promotional materials and campaigns for our global products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of million 
as a percent of product sales  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared million for  an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the progression of clinical trials for taribavirin  retigabine and pradefovir and costs associated with the completion of safety studies for zelapar 
we completed enrollment of two phase studies for taribavirin and a phase study for pradefovir 
we also advanced the clinical trials for retigabine acquired in march with the initiation of two phase trials 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase again in as progress continues with our major clinical trials 
amortization amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired with the acquisition of xcel  offset in part by a decrease in the amortization of a royalty intangible which was acquired in the ribapharm acquisition and is being amortized on an accelerated basis 
additionally  in  we recorded impairment charges on certain products sold in the uk  germany and spain in the amount of million 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million primarily related to products sold in italy for which the patent life was reduced by a decree by the italian government 
restructuring and impairment charges in we incurred an expense of million related to the manufacturing rationalization plan 
our manufacturing sites were tested for impairment resulting in an impairment of asset value on three of the sites 
accordingly  we wrote these sites down to their fair value and 
table of contents recorded impairment charges of million and severance charges of million in the year ended december  in we made the decision to dispose of another manufacturing plant in china which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
in we also recorded net gains of approximately million resulting from the sale of the manufacturing plants in the us  argentina and mexico 
acquired in process research and development ipr d in  we expensed million as ipr d in connection with the acquisition of xcel million and with the infergen business acquired from intermune million 
in  we incurred an expense of million associated with ipr d related to the acquisition of amarin that occurred in february the amounts expensed as ipr d represent our estimate of fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
other income  net  including translation and exchange other income  net  including translation and exchange was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net gain of million in in both and the amounts represent primarily the effects of translation gains and losses in europe and latin america 
translation and exchange gains are primarily related to us dollar denominated assets and liabilities at our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
loss on early extinguishment of debt the loss on early extinguishment of debt in million related to the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due we did not have a similar transaction in interest expense and income interest expense decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the decrease was due to repurchases of our convertible subordinated notes due in july  which eliminated the associated interest expense 
interest income increased million during the year ended december  compared to due primarily to higher cash balances in our interest bearing accounts and higher interest rates during the period 
income taxes despite reporting losses from continuing operations  we recorded tax expense of million in and million in this occurs primarily because  due to valuation allowances  no tax benefits are recorded for the us operating losses 
the valuation allowance also has the effect of deferring certain amounts that would normally impact the effective tax rate 
in addition  the xcel ipr d charge of million is not deductible for tax purposes resulting in higher effective tax rates for the year 
tax expense in was also impacted by a charge of million resulting from an internal revenue service examination of our us tax returns for the years to and taxes imposed on the repatriation of foreign earnings of million 
in and we recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with the us tax benefits we will receive as income tax loss carryforwards are offset against us taxable income in future years 
the reserve was recorded since we cannot assure that the products currently undergoing clinical trials will receive final approvals for marketing from regulatory authorities 
as a result we cannot be certain that sufficient us taxable income will be generated to utilize the tax benefits of the loss and credit carryforwards before they expire 
as of december  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets totaled million 
the tax provision was also negatively impacted by restructuring and impairment charges relating to facilities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we recorded minimal tax benefits in connection with these charges due to uncertainties about our ability to realize the benefits as reductions of our foreign tax liabilities 
some of these tax benefits were  however  recorded in as the likelihood of realizing the benefits increased 
income loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations was million in compared to million for the year ended december  the losses in primarily relate to our former raw materials businesses and manufacturing operations in central europe 
in the loss also includes environmental charges of million related to a former operating site of our biomedicals division  for which we retained the liability when we sold this business 

table of contents year ended december  compared to specialty pharmaceutical revenues specialty pharmaceutical product sales increased million for the year ended december  over the increases were led by continued improvements in sales of our global brands  which contributed million to the increase in product sales for the year ended december  in addition  favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed million on a net basis to the increase in overall product sales for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in the value of the euro over the us dollar

income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was a provision of compared to a provision of for our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was affected significantly by an increase of million in the valuation allowance to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the united states net operating losses and research credits 
it was also affected by pre tax losses resulting from restructuring and impairment charges of million and from a 
table of contents work force reduction in europe of million for which we recorded a minimal tax benefit of million 
this minimal tax benefit reflects the uncertainty of the realization of tax benefits in some of the jurisdictions in which these charges were incurred 
additionally  we recorded a tax provision of million related to the settlement of a tax dispute with puerto rico in the year ended december  our effective tax rate for was affected by pre tax losses resulting from the write off of acquired ipr d expenses in connection with the ribapharm acquisition  which were not deductible for tax purposes

cash flows provided by financing activities were million in and primarily consisted of the proceeds of a common stock offering in connection with the xcel acquisition  which raised net proceeds of approximately million offset by dividend payments of million 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   including payments on long term debt and notes payable of million  principally for the repurchase of the remaining portion of the convertible subordinated notes due  and cash dividends paid on common stock of million  partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of million 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to million principal amount of our senior notes due the interest rate on the swap is variable at libor plus 
the effect of this transaction was to initially lower our effective interest rate by exchanging fixed rate payments for floating rate payments 
on a prospective basis  the effective rate will float and correlate to the variable interest earned on our cash held 
at december  the effective rate on the million of debt under the swap agreement was 
we have collateral requirements on the interest rate swap agreement 
the amount of collateral varies monthly depending on the fair value of the underlying swap contracts 
as of december   we have collateral of million included in marketable securities and other assets related to these instruments 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through december   and to provide cash needed to fund capital expenditures and our research and development program 
we may seek additional debt financing or issue additional equity securities to finance future acquisitions or for other purposes 
we fund our cash requirements primarily from cash provided by our operating activities 
our sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash flow from operations 
we have historically paid quarterly cash dividends  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than more than total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations senior notes due convertible subordinated notes due convertible subordinate notes due other long term debt interest payments lease obligations total cash obligations we have initiated a project to install an enterprise resource planning information system which we expect to complete in approximately million is scheduled to be expended for this project in we have no material commitments for purchases of property  plant and equipment and we expect that for  such expenditures will approximate to million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques except for operating leases disclosed in our table contained in the contractual obligations section above 
our and notes include conversion features that are considered as off balance sheet arrangements under sec requirements 
products in development we expect our research and development expenses to increase in a large percentage of these expenditures will support the continuing product development programs for the late stage development projects of taribavirin  pradefovir and retigabine 
we expect that for  we will spend approximately million on external research and development costs related to these product development programs 
viramidine taribavirin is a nucleoside guanisine analog that is converted into ribavirin by adenosine deaminase in the liver 
we intend to develop taribavirin in oral form for the treatment of hepatitis c 
preclinical studies indicate that taribavirin  a liver targeting analog of ribavirin  has antiviral and immunological activities or properties similar to ribavirin 
in an animal model of acute hepatitis  taribavirin showed biologic activity similar to ribavirin 
the liver targeting properties of taribavirin were also confirmed in two animal models 
short term toxicology studies show that taribavirin may be safer than ribavirin at the same dosage levels 
this data suggests that taribavirin  as a liver targeting analog of ribavirin  may potentially be as 
table of contents effective and have a lower incidence of anemia than ribavirin 
on january   we announced a phase trial for taribavirin  as well as an initial analysis of the sustained viral response svr information for the taribavirin phase proof of concept study compared to ribavirin 
the results validated the study design by continuing to show that taribavirin demonstrates statistical comparable efficacy to ribavirin in svr and a significantly reduced incidence of anemia 
the taribavirin phase study  conducted entirely in the united states  consisted of treatment na ve subjects with chronic hepatitis c 
the study was an open label  randomized  active control trial  with patients stratified by genotype only 
the study consisted of four comparable treatment groups taribavirin mg bid mg daily  taribavirin mg bid mg daily  taribavirin mg bid mg daily and ribavirin mg daily  all in combination with peginterferon alfa a 
treatment duration was based on genotype  with genotypes two and three receiving weeks of treatment and genotype one receiving weeks of treatment  with a post treatment follow up period of weeks 
the week follow up period is considered the medically therapeutic standard evaluation for determining efficacy 
analyses of the final taribavirin phase study data were presented at the european association for the study of the liver conference easl in april the phase trial met its design objective by confirming the selection of the mg bid dose used in the two pivotal phase trials  viser and viser the results validated the study design by continuing to show that taribavirin demonstrates statistical comparable efficacy to ribavirin in sustained viral response svr and a significantly reduced incidence of anemia 
the viser phase trial was completed in december  and the company plans to report the viser results sometime in the first half of the viser trial is about six months behind viser at the end of december  all of the viser patients had completed treatment and entered follow up 
the last patient will complete follow up in june treatments in seven nda enabling phase studies for taribavirin were completed in  including a hepatic impairment study  a renal impairment study  and a drug drug interaction study 
post study activities  including sample analyses  will continue into the first part of a clinical development program to support marketing approval in japan has been developed  and a pharmacokinetics bridging study is planned to start in march our external research and development expenses for taribavirin were million for the year ended december  and million from inception through december  for pradefovir  which is being developed for the treatment of hepatitis b  we have completed two single dose phase clinical trials in healthy volunteers and two multiple dose studies in hepatitis b patients 
a week dose ranging phase study in asia and the united states began enrollment in july and completed enrollment in november on july  we announced our analysis of the week interim data from the phase trial 
the results demonstrated that pradefovir caused a significant decline in hbv dna  showed no evidence of nephrotoxicity  and no serious adverse events related to treatment 
the last patient visit in the phase trial was completed in january post study activities are proceeding  and we expect to know the final results in march we plan to submit an abstract to easl for presentation at the april meeting  which will summarize our phase data 
approximately patients have rolled over into a phase extension trial 
four phase studies  including an absorption metabolism excretion study and three drug drug interaction studies  were initiated in to support a future phase program with pradefovir  and end of study activities for those studies are continuing into we expect phase trials to be initiated later in our external research and development expenses for pradefovir were million for year ended december   and million including a milestone payment of million from inception through december  we acquired the rights to retigabine  an adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy  as part of the march acquisition of xcel pharmaceuticals  inc retigabine is believed to have a unique  dual acting mechanism and has undergone several phase clinical trials 
the phase trials included more than patients in several dose ranging studies compared to placebo 
retigabine  successfully completed an end of phase meeting with the fda in november the results of the key phase study indicate that the compound is potentially efficacious with a demonstrated reduction in monthly seizure rates of to as adjunctive therapy in patients with partial seizures 
response rates in the two higher doses were statistically significant compared to placebo p 
two phase trials were initiated in one phase trial restore is being conducted at approximately sites mainly in the americas us  central south america  the second phase trial restore is being performed at sites in the rest of 
table of contents the world  mainly in europe 
on september   the first patient in the restore trial was enrolled 
enrollment of the first patient in the restore trial occurred in december the enrollment period in epilepsy studies can be lengthy  frequently requiring a year to a year and a half to enroll  but it is too early to predict the length of enrollment due to a the time needed to set up investigative sites and b competing trials 
a phase cardiology qtc study in healthy volunteers  a hepatic impairment study and a renal impairment study are being planned to start in mid assuming successful completion of the phase trials  availability of the trials results in the second half of  and approval by the fda  we would be able to launch retigabine in late our external research and development expenses for retigabine were million for the year ended december  we acquired the rights to zelapar  a late stage candidate being developed as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of parkinson s disease  in the amarin acquisition in february prior to the acquisition  amarin had received an approvable letter from the fda for zelapar  subject to the completion of two safety studies 
in late  following our completion of two safety studies  we submitted a response to the approvable letter 
we received a response to its submission from the fda that required the us to provide the fda with additional information 
a revised submission for zelapar was sent to the fda in march on september   an additional approvable letter was received from the fda with a request for additional data 
we filed the requested information with the fda in the fourth quarter of  and its filing was accepted as complete 
we received a new pdufa date in mid additionally  we are conducting preclinical and clinical studies that were originally part of amarin s agreed upon phase commitment with the fda  which include a renal impairment study that started in november and a hepatic impairment study that started in january both of the phase studies will continue into assuming we receive approval from the fda  we expect to launch zelapar in our external research and development expenses for zelapar were  for the year ended december  and million from inception through december  on december   we completed the acquisition of the united states and canadian rights to the hepatitis c drug infergen interferon alfacon from intermune  inc infergen  or consensus interferon  is a bio optimized  selective and highly potent type interferon alpha originally developed by amgen and launched in the united states in it is currently indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients suffering from chronic hepatitis c viral infections with compensated liver disease who have not responded to other treatments primarily the combination of peg interferon and ribavirin or have relapsed after such treatment 
infergen is the only interferon with data in the label regarding use in patients following relapse or non response to certain previous treatments 
in connection with this transaction  the company acquired patent rights and rights to a clinical trial underway to expand applications of infergen 
in the direct trial that started in the second quarter of  patients were enrolled and treatment will be completed in the first quarter of the direct trial is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of daily infergen injections in combination with ribavirin in refractory patients 
at the end of january  approximately patients were still active in the direct trial  and approximately had rolled over into an extension trial 
post treatment follow up for the direct and extension trials are expected to be completed ie  last patient visit in the first and third quarters  respectively  of we expect to report and publish the results from these studies sometime in late we plan to use the results from the study to request approval from the fda to expand the product s label 
foreign operations approximately and of our revenues from continuing operations  which includes royalties  for the years ended december  and  respectively  were generated from operations or otherwise earned outside the united states 
all of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad 
see item a 
risk factors 
inflation and changing prices we experience the effects of inflation through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
we are subject to price control restriction on our pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in 
table of contents which we operate 
while we attempt to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  we operate in some markets which have price controls that may limit our ability to raise prices in a timely fashion 
future sales and gross profit will be impacted if we are unable to obtain price increases commensurate with the levels of inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards or fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revision is referred to as fas r share based payment fas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock plans 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective basis effective january  our adoption of fas r is expected to result in compensation expense of approximately million for however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of stock based awards our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  rebates  collectibility of receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales when title and risk of ownership transfers to the customer 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for rebates  discounts and returns  which are estimated and recorded at the time of sale 
allowances for future returns of products sold to our direct and indirect customers  who include wholesalers  retail pharmacies and hospitals  are calculated as a percent of sales based on historical return percentages taking into account additional available information on competitive products and contract changes 
our product sales are subject to a variety of deductions  primarily representing rebates and discounts to government agencies  wholesalers and managed care organizations 
these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and  as such  judgment is required when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on revenues for a reporting period 
in the united states we record provisions for medicaid and contract rebates based upon our actual experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior quarters 
we apply the experience ratio to the respective period s sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense 
this experience ratio is evaluated regularly and adjusted if necessary to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable 
we adjust the ratio to better match our current experience or our expected future experience  as appropriate 
in developing this ratio  we consider current contract terms  such as changes in formulary status and discount rates 
because our revenues in the united states include newly acquired products and have increased significantly in the last few years  ratios based on our historical experience may not be indicative of future experience 
if our ratio is not indicative of future experience  our results could be materially affected 

table of contents outside of the united states  the majority of our rebates are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period  both of these elements help to reduce the risk of variations in the estimation process 
some european countries base their rebates on the government s unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending and we use an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement 
we obtain third party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals 
if our estimates are not indicative of actual unbudgeted spending  our results could be materially affected 
historically  our adjustments to actual have not been material  on a quarterly basis  they generally have been less than of product sales 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program  type of customer and geographic location 
however  estimates associated with us medicaid and contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement 
this interval can range up to one year 
because of this time lag  in any given quarter  our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters 
we record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered  whichever is later 
we estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs 
we use third party data to estimate the level of product inventories  expiration dating  and product demand at our major wholesalers 
actual results could be materially different from our estimates  resulting in future adjustments to revenue 
for the years ended december  and  the provision for sales returns was less than of product sales 
we conduct a review of the current methodology and assess the adequacy of the allowance for returns on a quarterly basis  adjusting for changes in assumptions  historical results and business practices  as necessary 
we earn ribavirin royalties as a result of sales of products by third party licensees  schering plough and roche 
ribavirin royalties are earned at the time the products subject to the royalty are sold by the third party and are reduced by an estimate for discounts and rebates that will be paid in subsequent periods for those products sold during the current period 
we rely on a limited amount of financial information provided by schering plough and roche to estimate the amounts due to us under the royalty agreements 
sales incentives in the us market  our current practice is to offer sales incentives primarily in connection with launches of new products or changes of existing products where demand has not yet been established 
we monitor and restrict sales in the us market in order to limit wholesaler purchases in excess of their ordinary course of business inventory levels 
we operate inventory management agreements imas with major wholesalers in the united states 
however  specific events such as the case of sales incentives described above or seasonal demand eg antivirals during an outbreak may justify larger purchases by wholesalers 
we may offer sales incentives primarily in international markets  where typically no right of return exists except for goods damaged in transit  product recalls or replacement of existing products due to packaging or labeling changes 
our revenue recognition policy on these types of purchases and on incentives in international markets is consistent with the policies described above 
income taxes our income tax returns are subject to audit in various jurisdictions 
existing and future audits by  or other disputes with  tax authorities may not be resolved favorably for us and could have a material adverse effect on our reported effective tax rate and after tax cash flows 
we record liabilities for potential tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure 
new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities may affect the liability for potential tax assessments 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues  actual payments or assessments may differ from our estimates 
to the extent that our estimates differ from amounts eventually assessed and paid our income and cash flows can be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents the internal revenue service has completed an examination of our tax returns for the years through and has proposed adjustments to our tax liabilities for those years plus associated interest and penalties 
while we have written a formal protest in response to the proposed adjustments  we have recorded an additional tax provision of million should we not prevail in our position 
the provision consists of million as the estimated additional taxes  interest and penalties associated with the period to this amount is offset by million that would reduce net operating loss and other carryforwards resulting in no net expense or cash payment 
while we have substantial net operating loss and other carryforwards available to offset our us tax liabilities  the additional tax provision we recorded results from annual utilization limitations on those carryforwards that would result if the internal revenue service adjustments are upheld 
we assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefits associated with our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance for assets that are not expected to result in a realized tax benefit 
a significant amount of judgment is used in this process  including preparation of forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
if we revise these forecasts or determine that certain planning events will not occur  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made to tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we increased the valuation allowance significantly in and to recognize the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the us net operating losses and research credits 
impairment of property  plant and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment when conditions indicate a potential impairment 
we determine whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the property  plant and equipment with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  is then determined by comparing the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis  independent appraisals or preliminary offers from prospective buyers 
valuation of intangible assets we periodically review intangible assets for impairment using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
we determine whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating cash flows of the products associated with the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset impairment estimation process include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the assessment of the asset s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal or regulatory 
purchase price allocation including acquired in process research and development the purchase price for the xcel  infergen  amarin and ribapharm acquisitions were allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not 
table of contents limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocations may change as subsequent information becomes available 
we value ipr d acquired in a business combination based on an approach consistent with the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in business combinations to be used in research and development activities a focus in software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
the amounts expensed as acquired ipr d represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the data used to determine fair value requires significant judgment 
the estimated fair values were based on our use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take account of the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
the assumed tax rates are our estimate of the effective tax rates that will apply to the expected cash flows 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using discount rates between and 
the discount rates represent our weighted average cost of capital for each of the acquisitions 
in addition  solely for the purposes of estimating the fair value of ipr d projects acquired  we estimated that future research and development costs would be incurred in the amount of million for retigabine acquired from xcel  million for infergen and million for the projects held by ribapharm 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of acquisitions 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects include the uncertainty of our ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of product candidates based on the data from clinical trials and of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions we used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of these projects will materialize as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
contingencies we are exposed to contingencies in the ordinary course of business  such as legal proceedings and business related claims  which range from product and environmental liabilities to tax matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets 
we evaluate our exposure to such risks on an ongoing basis  and seek ways to manage these risks to an acceptable level  based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and cost 
we do not hold any significant amount of market risk sensitive instruments whose value is subject to market price risk 
our significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro  the mexican peso  the polish zloty  the swiss franc and the canadian dollar 
in march and june  we entered into foreign currency hedge transactions to reduce our exposure to variability in the euro 
these hedge agreements were terminated in december in may and november we entered hedge transactions to reduce our net investment exposure to the polish zloty 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analysis 
at december  the fair value of our financial instruments was in thousands assets liabilities notional contract carrying fair description amount value value currrency exchange contracts interest rate swaps outstanding public debt we currently do not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our financial assets are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short duration 
at december  we had million 
of foreign denominated variable rate debt that would subject us to both interest rate and currency risks 
in we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to million principal amount of our senior notes 
a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would not have had a material effect on our pretax earnings 
in addition  we had million of fixed rate debt as of december  that requires us dollar repayment 
to the extent that we require  as a source of debt repayment  earnings and cash flow from some of our units located in foreign countries  we are subject to risk of changes in the value of certain currencies relative to the us dollar
