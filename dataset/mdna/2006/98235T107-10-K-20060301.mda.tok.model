executive overview company description 
we are a global orthopaedic medical device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
reconstructive joint devices are used to replace knee  hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease or injury 
biologics are used to replace damaged or diseased bone  to stimulate bone growth  and to provide other biological solutions for surgeons and their patients 
we have been in business for over years and have built a well known and respected brand name and strong relationships with orthopaedic surgeons 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in arlington  tennessee  where we conduct our domestic research and development  manufacturing  warehousing  and administrative activities 
outside the us  we have research and development  manufacturing  and administrative facilities in toulon  france  research  distribution and administrative facilities in milan  italy  and sales and distribution offices in canada  japan and throughout europe 
we market our products in over countries through a global distribution system that consists of a sales force of approximately individuals who promote our products to orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals 
at the end of  we have approximately exclusive independent distributors and sales associates in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally who are employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 
company history 
we were incorporated in november as a delaware corporation  and had no operations until december   when we were reorganized by an investment group through the acquisition of our predecessor company  wright medical technology  inc this transaction represented a recapitalization of our predecessor company 
on december   we acquired cremascoli ortho holding  sa  an orthopaedic medical device company headquartered in toulon  france 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
principal products 
we primarily sell reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
our reconstructive joint device sales are derived from three primary product lines knees and hips  collectively referred to as our reconstructive large joint business  and extremities 
our biologics sales are derived from a broad portfolio of products designed to stimulate and augment the natural regenerative capabilities of the human body 
we also sell orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or biologics product lines 

table of contents our hip joint reconstruction product portfolio provides offerings in the areas of bone conserving implants  total hip reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation 
our hip joint products include the conserve family of products  the profemur hip system  the lineage acetabular system  the anca fit hip system  and the perfecta hip system 
our biologics products focus on biological musculoskeletal repair and include synthetic and human tissue based materials 
our principal biologics products include the graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes  the allomatrix line of injectable tissue based bone graft substitutes  the osteoset synthetic bone graft substitute  the miig family of minimally invasive injectable synthetic bone grafts  and in certain of our international markets  the adcon gel anti adhesion product 
we offer extremity products for the hand  wrist  elbow  shoulder  foot and ankle in a number of markets worldwide 
our principal extremity products include the evolve modular radial head device  the charlotte foot and ankle system  the locon t and locon vls distal radius plating systems  and the micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system 
we also sell the swanson line of finger and toe joint replacement products and the orthosphere carpometacarpal implant for repair of the basal thumb joint 
our knee reconstruction products position us well in the areas of total knee reconstruction  revision replacement implants  and limb preservation products 
our principal knee products include the advance knee system and the advance unicompartmental knee system 
significant business developments 
net sales grew in  totaling million  compared to million in our success is attributable to our focus on the high growth sectors of the orthopaedic industry  such as advanced bearing surfaces  modular necks and bone conserving implants within the hip market 
our hip  knee and extremity product lines contributed significantly to our performance in  achieving   and growth rates  respectively 
during  our domestic biologics business declined by approximately year over year 
this decline was driven by the continued downward trend in sales of our dbm containing allomatrix family of products due to competitive pressures in the mature market for dbm containing products 
we anticipate that domestic sales of these products will continue to decline in  however  we expect that these declines will be offset by sales growth of our graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes 
during  our international sales increased by approximately as compared to this slower rate of growth is attributable to our markets in france and italy  both of which declined year over year 
these declines began in the fourth quarter of as a result of the transition of certain management and distribution personnel in southern europe 
we anticipate that sales in france and italy will continue to decline year over year in the first half of however  we believe that sales in these markets will grow in the latter half of as the personnel now in place successfully complete this transitional period 
sales in our other international markets increased by in total during as compared to prior year 
in mid february  we launched our internally developed charlotte foot and ankle system and transitioned our foot and ankle business from a line of products supplied by a third party vendor pursuant to a distribution agreement that expired in the first quarter of the charlotte foot and ankle system offers a complete range of options for the most common foot and ankle surgical needs and includes six products that feature advanced design elements for simplicity  versatility  and high performance 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred approximately million of costs as a result of this transition to write down our distributed foot and ankle implant inventory to its estimated net realizable value and accelerated depreciation on the related surgical instrumentation 
the success of our charlotte foot and ankle system contributed significantly to the success of our extremity product line in in june  our premarket approval pma application with the united states food and drug administration fda for our adcon gel product was withdrawn by management 
based on the progress of the review to date  management determined that in order to adequately address all of the requests made by the fda in connection with their review of this application  withdrawal of the filing at this time was appropriate 
management is evaluating whether to continue to pursue re submission for this product 
if re submitted  there can be no assurance that the fda will accept another submission for filing in a timely manner or at all 

table of contents in november  we received marketing clearance from the fda for our ignite bone void filler kits 
this clearance was obtained based on satisfaction of the fda s requirements pursuant to a k premarket notification process that began with our submission of a k 
this submission was in response to the fda s clarification to all known manufacturers of dbm containing products including us  that such products should be regulated under the medical device premarket notification provisions of the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
as of december   all of the company s dbm containing products currently produced and sold in the us have received regulatory clearance 
significant industry factors 
our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and has recently experienced increased pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joints and biologic bone repair products 
we devote significant resources to assessing and analyzing competitive  regulatory and economic risks and opportunities 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in item a of this report 
net sales and expense components net sales 
we derive our net sales primarily from the sale of reconstructive joint devices and biologics products 
an overview of our principal product lines is provided in executive overview 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventories  royalty expenses associated with licensing technologies used in our products or processes  and certain other period expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  royalty and consulting expenses associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs  facility costs  legal costs  other general business and administrative expenses  and depreciation expense associated with surgical instruments required by surgeons to use when implanting our products 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
amortization of intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of purchased intangibles related to completed technology  distribution channels and trademarks primarily resulting from our acquisition of cremascoli  as well as distribution and product licenses  and non compete agreements 
we amortize intangible assets over periods ranging from to years 
stock based expense 
we incur non cash stock based expenses as a result of the amortization of non cash deferred compensation that is recorded in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this deferred compensation resulted following the issuance of stock options to employees and the sale of equity securities prior to the completion of our ipo when the estimated fair value of the securities was deemed  for financial reporting purposes  to have exceeded their respective exercise or sales price 
additionally  for stock based incentives granted to consultants  we defer and amortize the fair value of such grants 
table of contents as calculated pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods of the stock based incentives  which is generally four years  and we immediately expense all non cash stock based compensation associated with the issuance of equity where no vesting restrictions apply 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of share based transactions 
the fair value must be determined as of the date of grant using a valuation model such as black scholes or a lattice model 
the resulting compensation will be recognized over the service period 
in april  the sec amended rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for sfas no 
r 
this amendment modified the effective date of sfas no 
r  requiring adoption of this standard on the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  although management s evaluation of sfas no 
r is not complete  we estimate that the amount of non cash stock based compensation that we will record in pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
r will be significant 
the effect on our historical results of operations of expensing the fair value of stock options using the black scholes model and the provisions of sfas no 
is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  consists primarily of interest on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility  capital lease agreements  and certain of our factoring agreements  as well as non cash expenses associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facility 
these expenses are offset by income generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
provision for income taxes 
we record provisions for income taxes on earnings generated by both our domestic and international operations 
historically  our effective tax rates have varied from our statutory tax rates primarily due to research and development credits and changes in estimates related to our valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets stock based expense total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended year ended december  december  change hip products knee products biologics products extremity products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart pie chart net sales 
our net sales growth in was primarily attributable to the success of our domestic reconstructive joint business  as our domestic hip  extremity and knee product lines grew by   and  respectively 
domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately and of total net sales in and  respectively  and growth of 
international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in this increase in international sales is attributable to continued growth in our asian markets  which was partially offset by declines in our italian and french markets due to the transition of management and distribution personnel in southern europe 
our hip product sales totaled million in  representing a increase 
growth in our hip business in was primarily driven by our domestic markets  where total hip unit sales grew as compared to  reflecting the success of our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
additionally  we have continued to note favorable shifts in our sales mix to premium priced hard bearing procedures  which include our ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal products  which further contributed to our domestic growth 
in our international markets  hips sales increased by to million  as increased sales  primarily in japan  were mostly offset by declines in italy 
our extremity product sales increased to million in  representing growth of over  which is mainly attributable to increased unit sales of our evolve modular radial head system and the successful mid february launch of our charlotte foot and ankle system 
further contributing to our year over year growth were increased unit sales of our micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system and our locon t and locon vls distal radius plating systems 
sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of as compared to this increase was primarily driven by increased unit sales of our advance knee systems due to enhanced minimally invasive surgery mis instrumentation and broader acceptance of our advance double high tibial insert 
international knee sales growth in asia and certain european markets was partially offset by declines in france and italy 
sales of our biologics products in totaled million  and were relatively flat compared to prior year 
the continued growth of our graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes in the us  as well as increased sales in asia  were offset by declines of our dbm containing products in our domestic markets 
as we look ahead in  we anticipate continued growth within our reconstructive joint business 
in our knee business  we look forward to continuing success as our minimally invasive surgical instrumentation continues to gain acceptance in the us in our hip business  we anticipate that the strength of our hip product portfolio  which consists of our innovative bone conserving implants  advanced bearing surfaces and modular neck technology  will lead to continued success in the market 
our extremity business should continue to strengthen  driven mostly by our charlotte foot and ankle system  our evolve modular radial head system and our wrist fracture repair products 
within biologics  we expect sales of our graftjacket tissue repair and containment membranes to continue to expand 

table of contents cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to as compared to in cost of sales in included charges of approximately million to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal products in europe 
cost of sales in included charges of approximately million to write down certain foot and ankle inventory to its net realizable value as a result of the transition to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is attributable to increased levels of fixed manufacturing costs and distribution costs  as well as shifts in our product line sales 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled in  a percentage point increase from in this increase is primarily attributable to severance charges of approximately million incurred during related to the transition of management in our us and european operations  charges of approximately million related to a european distributor transition and the related legal dispute  increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives  and higher levels of legal fees 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable resolution in the second quarter of of two liabilities assumed as part of our december acquisition of cremascoli  lower expenses related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  reduced insurance costs  and the expenses related to our limited market withdrawal of certain conserve hip components and our foot and ankle product line transition 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to the extent that any additional growth in net sales results in increases in sales commissions and royalty expense associated with those sales and requires us to expand our infrastructure 
further  in the near term  we anticipate that these expenses will increase as a percentage of net sales as we make strategic investments in order to grow our business  and as we record non cash stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented approximately of net sales in  as compared to in the increase was driven by elevated levels of investments in product development initiatives and increases in clinical and regulatory spending 
our key product launches in included our charlotte foot and ankle system and our conserve bfh advance metal 
for  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives and clinical studies to support regulatory approvals and provide expanded proof of the efficacy of our products  and as we record non cash stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
amortization of intangible assets 
non cash charges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled million in versus million in based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and  in stock based expense 
we recognized  and million of non cash stock based expense during and  respectively 
this decrease is due to lower levels of amortization of deferred compensation related to options issued prior to our initial public offering in interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  consists of interest expense of approximately million during both and  primarily from borrowings under our senior credit facility  capital lease agreements  and certain of our factoring agreements  offset by interest income of approximately million and  during and  respectively  generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the increase in interest income is attributable to our investments in marketable securities during these investments are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for and was approximately and  respectively  which reflects the impact of research and development credits  changes in estimates related to the valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets and  in  the impact of the domestic manufacturers deduction included within the american jobs creation act of we expect our effective tax rate to be significantly higher than our historical effective tax rates as a result of the expense we will be required to record under the provisions of sfas r 
a significant portion of the non cash stock based compensation that we will recognize may not be deductible under us and foreign tax regulations 
we cannot reasonably estimate our overall effective tax rate for  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of future stock option grants and the related expense that will ultimately be deductible for tax purposes 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollar amounts in thousands and as percentages of net sales year ended december  of of amount sales amount sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets stock based expense acquired in process research and development costs total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for the periods indicated in thousands and the percentage of year over year change year ended year ended december  december  change hip products knee products biologics products extremity products other total net sales 
table of contents the following graphs illustrate our product line sales as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and pie chart pie chart net sales 
net sales growth in was attributable to increased sales across all of our principal product lines  with significant contributions from hips and biologics which grew by and  respectively  and solid growth in our extremity and knee business which grew by and  respectively 
geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in both years and growth of 
our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included a favorable currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  principally resulting from the performance of the euro against the us dollar 
our international growth was primarily driven by increased sales in our european and asian markets  with expansion across all product lines 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across all of our principal product lines 
for  we experienced growth of   and  in our hip  biologics  extremity  and knee product lines  respectively 
our most significant growth drivers in were our hip and biologics product lines 
during  our hip sales growth was attributable primarily to success in domestic markets  specifically driven by our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
in our international markets  unit sales growth of our conserve plus resurfacing implant and a favorable currency impact of million both impacted the year over year sales increase 
the growth of our biologics business in was primarily attributable to the continued favorable performance  in domestic markets  of our graftjacket soft tissue repair and containment membranes combined with the performance of our adcon gel product in international markets 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in approximately percentage points of this increase was attributable to million of costs incurred during the fourth quarter of to write down certain foot and ankle implant inventory to its net realizable value as a result of the transition of this product line to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
the remaining increase as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to higher levels of charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventories 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses decreased  as a percentage of net sales  by percentage points to in operating expenses include selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles  stock based expenses and  in  acquired in process research and development costs 
the decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by the charge of million for in process research and development 
further  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points  driven by lower royalty and commission expenses as a percentage of sales due to shifts in our geographic sales mix  which were partially offset by incremental corporate governance costs as well as charges associated with our limited market withdrawal of certain conserve hip components and our foot and ankle product line transition 
lower levels of stock based expense also contributed to our year over year decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 

table of contents in process research and development cost 
upon consummation of our acquisition of certain adcon gel technology assets from gliatech inc in march  we immediately recognized as expense approximately million in costs representing the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we engaged an independent third party to conduct a valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from this project  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
an additional discount was applied to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the acquired iprd 
the resulting net cash flows from the project were based on management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
a summary of the estimates used to calculate the net cash flows for the project is as follows year net cash in flows discount rate including expected to factor to account for project begin uncertainty of success acquired iprd adcon gel adcon gel products are designed to reduce adhesion formation following lumbar spine adcon l gel and peripheral tendon nerve adcon t n gel procedures  thus reducing or eliminating post operative pain 
both adcon l gel and adcon t n gel are commercially available internationally  but are currently not available for sale in the us adcon l gel had previously received regulatory clearance from the fda in in  the fda determined that the provisions of its application integrity policy aip would be applied to gliatech due to violations of good clinical practices in the conduct  analysis  and reporting of data specific to the us clinical study of adcon l gel 
in  the fda lifted the aip status of gliatech  which subsequently allowed us  as the new owner of the technology  to present the fda with clinical data intended to support the return of adcon l gel to the us market 
however  in  our pma application with the fda for our adcon gel product was withdrawn by management 
management is considering whether to continue to pursue re submission for this product 
if re submitted  there can be no assurance that the fda will accept another submission for filing in a timely manner or at all 
we may use portions of our existing cash to continue to develop the acquired iprd into commercially viable products 
this development would consist primarily of the completion of all clinical evaluation testing activities and regulatory approvals that are necessary to establish the safety and efficacy of the products and to market them in the us bringing the acquired iprd to market could also include testing the products for compatibility and interoperability with commercially viable products 
due to the history of the adcon gel products with the fda  we are unable to estimate the extent of research and development activities that will be necessary to develop these products into commercially viable products 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for both and was approximately  which reflects the impact of research and development credits and changes in estimates related to the valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets 
seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter months than throughout the rest of the year as a result of the european holiday schedule 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this day event  we display our most recent and innovative products for these surgeons 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain liquidity measures in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities working capital line of credit availability during  we invested million of our excess cash balance in short term marketable debt securities in order to increase our rate of return  resulting in a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents 
specifically  our investments in marketable securities at december   are available for redemption through an auction process every or days from initial purchase 
while these investments are not considered cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that these investments will have an impact on our overall liquidity position 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in the  as compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to million of cash invested in marketable securities and increased payments for estimated income taxes of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities in benefited from the profitability of our business and working capital management  which resulted primarily from improved collection of our outstanding receivables during  which was offset by increased investments in new product inventory in order to prepare for anticipated product launches  as well as an increase of approximately million for estimated tax payments 
investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in the increase in is primarily related to investments in minimally invasive surgical instrumentation for our hip and knee businesses 
our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment  and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in total for for routine capital expenditures 
in  in addition to our routine capital expenditures  we paid million to complete the purchase of iprd  tangible assets  and intangible assets from gliatech  which were primarily related to the adcon gel technology 
we are continuously evaluating opportunities to purchase technology and other forms of intellectual property and are  therefore  unable to predict the timing of future purchases 
financing activities 
during  we made million in scheduled payments related to borrowings under our senior credit facility and approximately million in payments related to our long term capital leases 
these payments were offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our stock based compensation plans 
in addition  our operating subsidiary in italy continues to factor portions of its accounts receivable balances under factoring agreements  which are considered financing transactions for financial reporting purposes 
the cash proceeds received from these factoring agreements  net of the amount of factored receivables collected  are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the proceeds received under these agreements in   and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these proceeds were offset by payments for factored receivables collected of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we recorded obligations of million and million for the amount of receivables factored under these agreements as of december  and  respectively  which are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in  our debt payments will total million based on the terms of our senior credit facility 
additionally  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of approximately million in we anticipate that our factoring program in italy will continue  however  the level and extent of the amounts factored under the agreement and the ultimate amount of proceeds received under the program cannot be predicted 

table of contents therefore  we are unable to predict the ultimate amount of proceeds that will be received in related to these factoring agreements 
contractual cash obligations 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by periods after total amounts reflected in balance sheet notes payable capital lease obligations amounts not reflected in balance sheet operating leases purchase obligations royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest our senior credit facility  which we entered into in august  has a five year term and consists of million in term loans  with an unpaid balance of approximately million at december   and a revolving loan facility of up to million 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and are collateralized by all of the assets of wright medical technology  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
the credit facility contains customary covenants including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  prepay debt  incur additional debt and sell assets 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants  including a specified consolidated leverage or debt to equity ratio and a specified consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
in the event that we violate any covenants  we could be required to repay the remaining balance of the debt 
additionally  should we be required to repay the loan before its scheduled maturity  we would incur a charge to operating income for unamortized financing costs 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest either at a rate equal to a fixed base rate plus a spread of to or at a rate equal to an adjusted libor plus a spread of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  with a current annual rate of 
the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments to consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 

table of contents in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our domestic sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales  and a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to other royalties earned based on product sales 
further  under our factoring agreement in italy  our liability for cash proceeds received of million discussed in financing activities may be subject to repayment upon days notice 
none of these amounts are included in the table above 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock which generated million in net proceeds 
in  our senior credit facility will expire and it is our current intent to replace this credit facility with a new facility including a credit line equal to or greater than our current million credit line 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to replace our current credit facility with a new facility which includes a credit line of this level 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balance of million  and our expected cash flow from our operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  meet our contractual cash obligations in  and fund any potential expansion of our current facilities or the construction of new facilities 
critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
however  certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are generated through two types of customers  hospitals and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives  and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals when the hospital takes title to the product  which is when the product is surgically implanted in a patient and a purchase order is received from the hospital 
we view the receipt of a purchase order as the evidence of customer acceptance of the product 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 

table of contents approximately  and  of deferred revenue related to these types of agreements was recorded at december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience some credit loss on our accounts receivable and accordingly we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of the company s receivables are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  the company s collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  the company has experienced minimal bad debts from its hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
the company writes off receivables when it determines that the receivables are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically accurate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly and as such  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
our accounts receivable balance for both and was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory included million recorded to write down certain foot and ankle implant inventory to its net realizable value as a result of our transition to our charlotte foot and ankle system 
in  we incurred approximately million in charges within cost of sales to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal products in europe 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning  and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of 
table of contents evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
our estimates of future sales growth rates and operating margin can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on its fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
during  we recorded  in product liability reserves for probable losses following our announcement of a voluntary market withdrawal of a limited number of metal acetabular hip cups intended for use in our conserve hip systems 
management developed this estimate and believes that the amount recorded is appropriate based on assumptions with respect to estimated patient claims related to the market withdrawal and the acceptance of such claims by our insurer 
the nature of a market withdrawal and the associated claims are such that the claims will occur over an extended period of time 
our estimate includes an assumption for unasserted claims based on management s industry experience with similar circumstances 
while we believe that the amount recorded related to the market withdrawal is appropriate  it is possible that changes in assumptions related to potential claims or insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our estimate 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately  and million at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carry forward of certain net operating losses and general business tax credits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in 
table of contents establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility which are subject to a variable annual interest rate  which is currently per year 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the variable rate 
based on this debt level  a increase in the interest rate of all such borrowings would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries and are denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the japanese yen 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds  and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
