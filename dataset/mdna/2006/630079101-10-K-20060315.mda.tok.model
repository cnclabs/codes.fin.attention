item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the case of rohm and haas electronic materials cmp  inc rhem  formerly known as rodel  the company has collaborated in selling current generation ceria based chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
table of contents materials to rhem s customers 
in june of  rhem and nanophase entered into a supply agreement which requires rhem to purchase of its annual requirements for  and specified minimum dollar amounts of  nanocrystalline ceria for use in cmp of semiconductors in order for rhem to retain its exclusive worldwide rights to the company s nanocrystalline ceria products in this field of use 
in february of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem 
this amendment allowed rhem to maintain exclusivity by purchasing lower dollar amounts of nanocrystalline materials  while extending the agreement through this amendment did not require rhem to purchase any materials from the company in  but it did require an aggregate of  be paid to nanophase in four equal quarterly installments in to support ongoing efforts in joint slurry product development during this  was fully earned in in october of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem a second time 
this amendment reduced the minimum purchase requirements necessary to maintain the company s exclusivity obligations to rhem by approximately during the reduction reflects the parties recognition of the difficulty in precisely estimating the timing of product development and sales in the semiconductor polishing market 
pursuant to the october amendment  rhem is now obliged to purchase a guaranteed quantity of material in to maintain exclusivity  this schedule was agreed upon in accordance with the terms of the amendment 
the company leverages its resources through relationships with organizations focused on market specific eg  basf  rhem or geography specific areas 
these relationships enhance nanophase s ability to quickly develop lead customers and applications for its products 
another of these relationships is with c 
i 
kasei  a division of itochu corporation cik 
cik develops  engineers and manufactures products under license from the company specifically for the company s pvs technology for use in multiple industrial markets 
the company s agreement  originating in  with cik stipulates a minimum royalty every twelve months of the greater of  or of cik s sales of licensed product  payable to the company until  to guarantee cik an exclusive license in designated parts of asia 
after that time  the agreement calls for a royalty of of cik s sales of licensed product  at which time cik s license of nanophase s pvs technology in designated parts of asia would become non exclusive 
cik may terminate its agreement with the company at any time upon days prior written notice 
while cik continues to sell materials in designated parts of asia on a regular basis  management does not believe that revenue related to the cik agreement will contribute significantly  beyond the levels it has in the past  to the near term growth of the company 
on march   the company received  in gross proceeds in the form of an equity investment from altana  a large german chemical company 
altana received  shares of nanophase common stock 
altana and nanophase have agreed that the shares will remain unregistered  and therefore not freely saleable  until march   at which point the company will register such shares for resale as soon as practicable in accordance with the terms of the company s registration rights agreement with altana 
simultaneous with this transaction  the company executed a joint development agreement with altana in order to explore new product applications in fields that are mutually beneficial to both companies 
pursuant to the agreement  the company and altana have granted each other  subject to limited exceptions  exclusive rights for the development and purchase of nanomaterials for use in paints  coatings  inks  polymers and plastics  varnishes and other related applications 
management believes that these agreements with altana will be beneficial to the company in several ways 
altana is a prominent ingredient supplier to many industries that the company has had limited success in approaching in the past including paint and industrial coatings companies 
by approaching these companies at the ingredient supplier level  with the company s materials already compounded into altana s ingredient products  the company expects a higher likelihood of success in various applications and in these industries 

table of contents secondly  altana has global sales  technical support  capabilities for basic research  additional application development capability to incorporate nanomaterials  and an existing customer base and market relationships 
nanophase expects that this new partnership will help nanophase address markets at an entry point that should allow for quicker and broader adoption of nanomaterials in composite coatings and plastics 
this mutually exclusive agreement is separate and distinct from the company s existing agreements with basf and rhem  as the fields of application do not intersect 
management expects altana to continue to develop new products and market them on an ongoing basis 
altana should become a significant customer of nanophase during the agreement with altana has an initial term of eight years  with one year renewal provisions 
on november   byk chemie usa  a customer of nanophase  lent  to nanophase pursuant to the terms of a promissory note received effective october  this loan was for the purchase and installation of additional dispersion capacity and an additional nanoarc synthesis reactor to allow both for quicker material and application development  which should help to speed market penetration  and the ability to fulfill orders on a commercial scale for additional materials in varying media 
the company  from time to time  employs marketing representatives or sales agents focused in specific application areas 
nanophase also markets itself and its capabilities by sponsoring  attending and presenting at advanced materials symposia and industry trade shows for its target markets  and by publishing articles in a variety of scientific and trade journals 
the company also markets itself and its capabilities through its web site  by advertising in selected industry and trade journals and by providing specification sheets and other marketing materials to prospective customers 
in addition  nanophase networks with certain fortune companies to display its technology and uncover potential applications 
the company often makes technical presentations at various events where the company s scientists and business development people meet with their counterparts at other companies and explore potential technical relationships and collaborative applications research 
technology and engineering the company s technology and engineering group includes the research and development  process engineering and advanced engineering functions 
consistent with the company s goal to remain at the forefront of nanomaterials technologies  the objective of nanophase s research and process development activities is to gather core technologies that have the capability to serve multiple commercial markets  continue to improve and evolve the company s manufacturing technologies and develop new nanomaterials and associated applications  usually working directly with potential and current customers 
nanophase s total research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  during the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
this represents the company s share of these expenses only and does not take into account amounts spent by our largest customers in support of our partnerships 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to keep pace with evolving advanced materials technologies and industry standards 
through the five year period ended december   the company has had cumulative research and development expenses of approximately million and cumulative expenditures on equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million 
these investments in technology and production capacity and capability have helped to take nanophase from a development stage company to commercialization 
manufacturing operations the company s manufacturing operations include the production of nanomaterials in the form of nanoparticles  utilizing two different methods pvs and nanoarc synthesis 
the company also has a large quantity nanoparticle coating operation to support its sunscreen business  as well as dispersion equipment to support its cmp and polishing initiatives and other product and market areas 

table of contents the company has manufacturing capacity based in two locations in the chicago area 
at each of these facilities  nanophase is able to develop and supply its nanomaterials in quantities ranging from grams to metric tons 
nanophase s facilities are certified to iso international standards and are current good manufacturing practices cgmp compliant for applicable bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing 
the company s facilities are also certified to the international standard for environmental management  iso all processes are controlled under six sigma discipline with the capability to manufacture precisely to application requirements 
unlike traditional quality control  six sigma provides methods to reengineer processes to eliminate non value added steps and create a system that minimizes errors and defects 
nanophase s operations employ a cellular team based manufacturing approach  where workers operate in work cells  under a lean manufacturing environment to continuously advance production capabilities 
management is committed to a lean manufacturing approach where  to the extent possible given a certain measure of irregular demand  the company is able to avoid excess labor  inventory and supply levels in order to minimize working capital demands 
this approach complements two of the company s major production goals which are to increase nanomaterials output without adding to existing equipment and to reduce production costs 
intellectual property and proprietary rights nanophase relies primarily on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect its intellectual property 
in addition to obtaining patent and trademarks based on the company s inventions and products  nanophase also licenses certain third party patents to expand its technology base 
during  nanophase continued to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio by adding to its patents  pending patents  and proprietary knowledge 
as of the date of this report  nanophase owns or licenses us patents and patent applications consisting of owned us patents  pending us patent applications  license to pending us patent applications and licensed us patents 
the owned us patents consist of for its nanoparticle synthesis technologies  for its surface treatment technologies and for its nanoparticle applications in coatings 
the company s pending us patents and license to a pending us patent consist of in nanoparticle synthesis  in nanoparticle surface treatments  including dispersion of nanoparticles in various media and in nanoparticle applications 
correspondingly  the company has foreign patents and pending patent applications consisting of owned foreign patents and pending foreign patents 
all of the pending and owned foreign patents are counterparts to domestic filings covering its platform of nanotechnologies 
in addition  the company s management believes that  based on its past experience  up to of its currently pending patent applications will be issued in the company s oldest patents will begin to expire in see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
competition within each of its targeted markets and product applications  nanophase faces current and potential competition from many advanced materials and chemical companies  suppliers of traditional materials and the in house capabilities of several of its current and potential customers 
in many markets  the company s competitors are larger and more diversified than the company  although management believes its materials and related technologies are superior to those of its competitors in terms of their ability to be readily engineered to meet specific performance requirements 
with respect to traditional suppliers  however  the company competes against lower priced traditional materials where the benefits 
table of contents of using nanomaterials do not always outweigh their typically higher costs 
with respect to larger producers of nanomaterials  while many of these producers do not currently offer competitive products  these companies have greater financial and technical resources  larger research and development staffs and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities and could soon begin to compete directly against nanophase 
in addition  the number of development stage companies involved in nanocrystalline materials continues to grow on a global basis  posing significant and increasing competitive risks 
many of these companies are associated with university or national laboratories and use chemical and physical methods to produce nanocrystalline materials 
management believes that most of these companies are engaged primarily in funded research and is not aware that any of them have commercial production capabilities  however  they may represent competitive risks in the future 
some development stage companies  especially in other countries  receive significant local government assistance 
management anticipates that foreign competition may play a greater role in the nanomaterials arena in the future 
governmental regulations the manufacture and use of certain of the products that contain the company s nanocrystalline materials are subject to governmental regulations 
as a result  the company is required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements of the us food and drug administration fda and similar regulations that include testing  control and documentation requirements enforced by periodic inspections 
in addition  the company s facilities and all of its operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various environmental and occupational safety and health laws 
to date  other than creating additional expense due to their reach and complexity  those regulations have not materially restricted or impeded operations 
employees on december   the company had a total of full time employees  of whom hold advanced degrees 
nanophase has no collective bargaining arrangements 
backlog nanophase does not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 
the company s sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of nanomaterials 
nanophase has some agreements that give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of nanomaterials during a specified time period 
these agreements  however  often do not obligate the customers either to purchase any particular quantity of such nanomaterials at all  or in the case where an obligation exists  the risk to the customer for not purchasing nanomaterials is the loss of exclusivity 
the quantity actually purchased by the customer  as well as the shipment schedules  are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
the company does not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts 
business segment and geographical information see note to the financial statements for additional information 
key customers a limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of the company s commercial revenue 
in particular  revenue from basf  rhem and cik constituted approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company s customers are significantly larger than the company and are able to exert a high degree of influence over the 
table of contents company 
while the company s agreements with these three customers are long term agreements  they may be terminated by the customer with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that these customers will continue to buy the company s products 
the loss of one of these key customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

item a 
risk factors the following risks  uncertainties  and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and growth prospects 

table of contents we have a limited operating history and may not be able to address difficulties encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we have only a limited operating history 
we were formed in november and began our commercial nanocrystalline materials operations in january we have not yet generated a significant amount of revenue from our nanocrystalline materials operations 
because of our limited operating history and the early stage of development of our rapidly evolving market  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and adversely affect our business and cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address these risks 
in addition  our efforts to address any of these risks may distract personnel or divert resources from other more important initiatives  such as attracting and retaining customers and responding to competitive market conditions 
we have a history of losses that may continue in the future 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception with net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and presently expect to continue to incur losses on an annual basis through at least the end of we believe that our business depends  among other things  on our ability to significantly increase revenue 
if revenue fails to grow at anticipated rates or if operating expenses increase without a commensurate increase in revenue  or if we fail to adjust operating expense levels accordingly  then the imbalance between revenue and operating expenses will negatively impact our cash balances and our ability to achieve profitability in future periods 
we depend on a small number of customers for a high percentage of our sales  and the loss of orders from a significant customer could cause a decline in revenue and or increases in the level of losses incurred 
sales to our customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and annual supply contracts  however  customers can cease doing business with us at any time with limited advance notice 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
we may not be able to retain our strategic customers  such customers may cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  such orders may not be replaced by other sales or by sales that are on as favorable terms 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  which could affect our ability to achieve anticipated revenues on a quarterly basis 
revenue from basf corporation  rohm and haas electronic materials cmp inc formerly known as rodel and ci kasei  a division of itochu corporation  accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   and revenue from the same three customers accounted for approximately of total revenue in for the years ended december  and  basf accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
if we were to lose  or receive significantly decreased orders from  any of these three customers  then our results of operations would be materially harmed 
while our agreements with our two largest customers are long term agreements  they may be terminated by the customer with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that these customers will continue to buy our products 
in addition  while our agreements with our two largest customers contain minimum order requirements  the only repercussion under the agreements for missing the minimum order requirement is that we would be freed from the exclusivity obligations under these contracts 
we have been consistently expanding both our marketing and business development efforts and our production efficiency in order to address the issues of our dependence upon a limited amount of customers  enhancement of gross profit and operating cash flows  and the achievement of profitability 
we currently have customers that may grow to the point where they generate significant revenues and 
table of contents margins as relationships expand 
given the special nature of our products  and the fact that markets for them are not yet fully developed  it is difficult to accurately predict when additional large customers will materialize 
going forward  the company s margins  as a percentage of revenue  will be dependent upon revenue mix  revenue volume and the company s ability to continue to cut costs 
the extent of the growth in revenue volume and the related gross profit that this revenue generates  will be the main drivers in generating positive operating cash flows and  ultimately  net income 
any downturn in the markets served by us would harm our business 
a majority of our products are incorporated into products such as sunscreens  polishing slurries  personal care  and to a lesser extent  medical diagnostics  abrasion resistant coatings for flooring  and other products 
these markets have from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
these industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
our business would be harmed by any future downturns in the markets that we serve 
our products often have long adoption cycles  which could make it difficult to achieve market acceptance and makes it difficult to forecast revenues 
due to their often novel characteristics and the unfamiliarity with them that exists in the marketplace  our nanocrystalline materials often require longer adoption cycles than existing materials technologies 
our nanomaterials have to receive appropriate attention within any potential customer s organization  then they must be tested to prove a performance advantage over existing materials  typically on a systems cost basis 
once we have proven initial commercial viability  pilot scale production runs must be completed by the customer  followed by further testing 
once production level commercial viability is established  then our nanomaterials can be introduced  often to a downstream marketplace that needs to be familiarized with them 
if we are unable to convince our potential customers of the performance advantages and economic value of our nanocrystalline materials over existing and competing materials and technologies  we will be unable to generate significant sales 
our long adoption cycle makes it difficult to predict when sales will occur 
we depend on collaborative development relationships with our customers and do not have a substantial direct sales force or an established distribution network apart from the distribution networks of our strategic partners 
if we are unable to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships or if the terms of these relationships limit the distribution of our products or if our strategic partners are unable to distribute our products efficiently  then we may be unable to independently develop  manufacture or market our current and future nanocrystalline materials or applications 
we have established  and will continue to pursue  strategic relationships with many of our customers and do not have a substantial direct sales force or an established distribution network other than distribution arrangements for research samples 
through these relationships  we seek to develop new applications for our nanocrystalline materials and share development and manufacturing resources 
we also seek to coordinate the development  manufacture and marketing of our nanocrystalline products 
future success will depend  in part  on our continued relationships with these customers and our ability to enter into similar strategic relationships with other customers 
our customers may not continue in these collaborative development relationships  may not devote sufficient resources to the development or sale of our materials or may enter into strategic development relationships with our competitors 
these customers may also require a share of control of these collaborative programs 
some of our agreements with these customers limit our ability to license our technology to others and or limit our ability to engage in certain product development or marketing activities 
these relationships generally can be terminated unilaterally by customers 
additionally and except for our research quantities distribution agreement with alfa aesar  these 
table of contents customers generally require exclusive distribution arrangements within the field of application covered by our agreement with these customers  and the very nature of these strategic relationships limits the distribution of our products to the distribution networks available to our strategic relationship partners 
in addition  the development agreements with some of our larger customers contain provisions that require us to license our intellectual property to these customers on disadvantaged terms and or transfer equipment to these customers in the event that we materially breach these agreements or fail to satisfy certain financial covenants 
for example  see risk factors we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unable to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships or if the terms of these relationships materially limit our access to distribution channels for our products  then we may be unable to independently develop  manufacture or market our current and future nanocrystalline materials or applications 
if commodity metal prices increased at such a rate that we are unable to recover lost margins on a timely basis or that our products became uncompetitive in their current marketplaces  our financial and liquidity position and results of operations would be substantially harmed 
many of our significant raw materials come from commodity metal markets that may be subject to rapid price increases 
while we generally pass commodity price increases on to our customers  it is possible that  given our limited customer base and the limited control we have over it  commodity metal prices could increase at such a rate that could hinder our ability to recover lost margins from our customers on a timely basis 
it is also possible that such drastic cost increases could render some of our materials uncompetitive in their current marketplaces when considered relative to other materials on a cost benefit basis 
if either of these potential results occurred  our financial and liquidity position and results of operations would be substantially harmed 
if a catastrophe strikes either of our manufacturing facilities or if we were to lose our lease for either facility due to non renewal or other unforeseen events  we may be unable to manufacture our materials to meet customers demands 
our manufacturing facilities are located in romeoville and burr ridge  illinois 
these facilities and some of our manufacturing and testing equipment would be difficult to replace in a timely manner 
therefore  any material disruption at one of our facilities due to a natural or man made disaster or a loss of lease due to non renewal or other unforeseen events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products to meet customers demands 
while we maintain customary property insurance  this insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur and would not compensate us for any interruption in our business 
if we are unable to expand our production capabilities to meet unexpected demand  we may be unable to manage our growth and our business would suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture nanocrystalline materials in significant quantities  with consistent quality and in an efficient and timely manner 
we expect to continue to expand our current facilities or obtain additional facilities in the future in order to respond to unexpected demand for existing materials or for new materials that we do not currently make in quantity 
such unplanned demand  if it resulted in rapid expansion  could create a situation where growth could become difficult to manage  which could cause us to lose potential revenue 
protection of our intellectual property is limited and uncertain 
our intellectual property is important to our business 
we seek to protect our intellectual property through patent  trademark  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our 
table of contents employees  customers  suppliers and others 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others  including our competitors  may use our proprietary technology without our consent 
we may not receive the necessary patent protection for any applications pending with the us patent and trademark office uspto and any of the patents that we currently own or license may not be sufficient to keep competitors from using our materials or processes 
in addition  patents that we currently own or license may not be held valid if subsequently challenged by others and others may claim rights in the patents and other proprietary technology that we own or license 
additionally  others may have already developed or may subsequently develop similar products or technologies without violating any of our proprietary rights 
if we fail to obtain patent protection or preserve our trade secrets  we may be unable to effectively compete against others offering similar products and services 
in addition  if we fail to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others or lose any license to technology that we currently have or will acquire in the future  we may be unable to continue making the products that we currently make 
moreover  at times  attempts may be made to challenge the prior issuance of our patents 
for example  the uspto has granted a third party request for re examination with respect to one patent relating to one of our nanoparticle manufacturing processes 
on september   our representatives conducted an interview with the examiner assigned to the re examination at the uspto  resulting in the examiner preparing an interview summary indicating that the examiner agreed that all the issued claims were patentable 
however  prior to the uspto issuing a formal notice confirming patentability  the same third party filed a second request for re examination of the patent which second request  the uspto has since denied 
nonetheless  a second interview was conducted  resulting in an amendment to all patent claims 
while we will continue to vigorously defend our patent position  we may not be successful in maintaining the scope of the claims of this patent during re examination 
if our patent claims are narrowed substantially by the uspto  the patent coverage afforded our nanoparticle manufacturing process could be impaired 
while we would not expect such impairment to affect the value of our manufacturing trade secrets that have not been disclosed in the patent  it could impede the extent of our legal protection of the invention that is subject to this patent and potentially harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if others assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights  resolving the dispute could divert our management team and financial resources 
in the future  we may license certain of our intellectual property  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to third parties 
while we would attempt to ensure that any licensees maintain the quality and value of our brand  these licenses might diminish this quality and value 
we may be subject to claims that one or more of the business methods used by us infringe upon patents held by others 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time and other resources from our business operations 
either of these consequences of an infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  we may be forced to obtain licenses or pay royalties to continue to use our technology 
we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  our operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenue through our inability to serve clients or from increases in costs to license third party technology 

table of contents our industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with these changes  our business will not grow 
rapid changes have occurred  and are likely to continue to occur  in the development of advanced materials and processes 
our success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to keep pace with advanced materials technologies  industry standards and market trends and to develop and introduce new and improved products on a timely basis 
we expect to commit substantial resources to develop our technologies and product applications and  in the future  to expand our commercial manufacturing capacity as volume grows 
our development efforts may be rendered obsolete by the research efforts and technological advances of others and other advanced materials may prove more advantageous than those we produce 
our market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  then our business will not grow 
the advanced materials industry is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the market for materials having the characteristics and potential uses of our nanocrystalline materials is the subject of intensive research and development efforts by both governmental entities and private enterprises around the world 
we believe that the level of competition will increase further as more product applications with significant commercial potential are developed 
the nanocrystalline product applications that we are developing will compete directly with products incorporating both conventional and advanced materials and technologies 
while we are not currently aware of the existence of commercially available competitive products with the same attributes as those we offer  other companies may develop and introduce new or competitive products 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing materials  technologies and better or less expensive products than the ones we offer 
in addition  many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
if we fail to improve our current and potential nanocrystalline product applications at an acceptable price  or otherwise compete with producers of conventional materials  we will lose market share and revenue to our competitors 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our manufacturing and marketing operations or we may need to obtain funds through arrangements on less favorable terms or we may be required to transfer equipment to our largest customer 
we expect to expend significant resources on research  development and product testing  and in expanding current capacity or capability for new business 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights 
if necessary  we may seek funding through public or private financing and through contracts with government or other companies 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our manufacturing and marketing operations or we may need to obtain funds through arrangements on less favorable terms 
if we obtain funding on unfavorable terms  we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our intellectual property 
to raise additional funds in the future  we would likely sell our equity or debt securities or enter into loan agreements 
to the extent that we issue debt securities or enter into loan agreements  we may become subject to financial  operational and other covenants that we must observe 
in the event that we were to breach any of these covenants  then the amounts due under such loans or debt securities could become immediately payable by us  which could significantly harm us 
to the extent that we sell additional shares of our equity securities  our stockholders may face economic dilution and dilution of their percentage of ownership 

table of contents we currently have a supply agreement with basf that contains provisions which could potentially result in a mandatory license of technology and sale of production equipment to basf providing capacity sufficient to meet basf s production needs 
the license and related sale would be triggered only in the event that we breach certain of our obligations under the supply agreement or one of the following occurs our earnings for a twelve month period ending with our most recently published quarterly financial statements are less than zero and our cash  cash equivalents and investments are less than  or the acceleration of any debt maturity having a principal amount of more than  or we become insolvent as defined in the supply agreement 
in the event of a triggering event where we are required to sell to basf production equipment providing capacity sufficient to meet basf s production needs  the equipment would be sold at of the equipment s net book value 
we believe that we have sufficient cash balances to avoid the first triggering event through if a triggering event were to occur and basf elected to proceed with the license and related sale mentioned above  we would lose both significant revenue and the ability to generate significant revenue to replace that which was lost in the near term 
replacement of necessary equipment that would be purchased and removed by basf pursuant to this triggering event could take six months to a year 
any additional capital outlays required to rebuild capacity would probably be greater than the proceeds from the purchase of the assets pursuant to our agreement with basf 
this shortfall might put us in a position where it would be difficult to secure additional funding given what would then be an already tenuous cash position 
such an event would also result in the loss of many of our key staff and line employees due to economic realities 
we believe that our employees are a critical component of our success and would be difficult to quickly replace and train 
given the occurrence of such an event  we might not be able to hire and retrain skilled employees given the stigma relating to such an event and its impact on us 
we might elect to effectively reduce our size and staffing to a point where we could remain a going concern in the near term 
we depend on key personnel  and their unplanned departure could harm our business 
our success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified research and development  management  manufacturing  marketing and sales personnel on favorable terms 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we may have difficulty locating  hiring and retaining qualified personnel on favorable terms 
if we were to lose the services of any of our key executive officers or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract and retain other skilled and experienced personnel on acceptable terms in the future  or if we are unable to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to assume key roles upon any loss of our key personnel  then our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 
in addition  we do not currently have key man life insurance policies covering all of our executive officers or key employees  nor do we presently have any plans to purchase such policies 
we face potential product liability risks which could result in significant costs that exceed our insurance coverage  damage our reputation and harm our business 
we may be subject to product liability claims in the event that any of our nanocrystalline product applications are alleged to be defective or cause harmful effects to humans or physical environments 
because our nanocrystalline materials are used in other companies products  to the extent our customers become subject to suits relating to their products  such as cosmetic  skin care and personal care products  
table of contents these claims may also be asserted against us 
we may incur significant costs including payment of significant damages  in defending or settling product liability claims 
we currently maintain insurance coverage in the amount of million for product liability claims  which may prove not to be sufficient 
even if a suit is without merit and regardless of the outcome  claims can divert management time and attention  injure our reputation and adversely affect demand for our nanocrystalline materials 
we are subject to governmental regulations 
the costs of compliance and liability for noncompliance with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
current and future laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures for preventive or remedial action 
our operations  business or assets may be materially and adversely affected by governmental interpretation and enforcement of current or future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in addition  our coating operations pose a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
the damages in the event of an accident or the costs to prevent or remediate a related event could exceed both the amount of our liability insurance and our resources or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  both of our facilities and all of our operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various occupational safety and health laws 
we believe we have complied in all material respects with regard to governmental regulations applicable to us 
however  we may have to incur significant costs in defending or settling future claims of alleged violations of governmental regulations and these regulations may materially restrict or impede our operations in the future 
in addition  our efforts to comply with or contest any regulatory actions may distract personnel or divert resources from other more important initiatives 
the manufacture and use of certain products that contain our nanocrystalline materials are subject to extensive governmental regulation  including regulations promulgated by the us food and drug administration  the us environmental protection agency and the us occupational safety and health administration 
as a result  we are required to adhere to the requirements of the regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
these regulations could increase our cost of doing business and may render some potential markets prohibitively expensive 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders 
in october  we entered into a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the provisions of this agreement and some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock less any outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our common stock  without the consent of the holders of the common stock  including up to  shares of series a junior participating preferred stock issuable under the rights agreement 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporations law relating to business combinations with related stockholders and the terms of our stock option plans relating to changes of control may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

table of contents future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could negatively affect the market price of our stock and make it more difficult for us to sell stock in the future 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to complete future equity financings 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock and shares of common stock subject to outstanding warrants and options may be resold pursuant to currently effective registration statements 
as of march   there are  shares of common stock that have been issued in registered offerings  upon the exercise of options under our equity incentive plan or in private placements and are freely tradable in the public markets   shares of common stock that may be issued on the exercise of stock options outstanding and exercisable under our equity incentive plan   shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to our september  private placement and the related warrant which was exercised on september  the resale of these shares has been registered pursuant to a registration statement on form s which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on august   and  shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to our march  private placement and may be registered for resale after march  pursuant the terms of the registration rights agreement executed in connection with this private placement 
we cannot estimate the number of shares of common stock that may actually be resold in the public market because this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers  and other factors 
if stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
bradford t

we have been involved in litigation 
if we are involved in similar litigation in the future  the expense of defending such litigation and the potential costs of judgments against us and the costs of maintaining insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
we have been involved in three securities class action lawsuits  one of which was a consolidation of several related lawsuits 
while all of these lawsuits have been settled and dismissed with all settlements funded by our directors and officers liability insurance  we may be the target of additional securities lawsuits in the future 
if we are involved in similar litigation in the future  the expense of defending such litigation  the potential costs of judgments against us  the costs of maintaining insurance coverage and the diversion of management s attention could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock markets in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well 
our future financial performance and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues in any given period relative to the levels expected by investors could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
dilutive effect of private placements 
on september  we sold  shares of our common stock to grace brothers  ltd 
at a purchase price of per share together with a warrant to purchase a like number of shares of common stock during the next twelve months also at a price of per share 
this warrant was exercised on september  to acquire  newly issued shares of common stock 
the share price for the common stock was determined based on the fifteen day market closing average for our stock ending september  on september  and september  the closing sale price of our common stock as reported on nasdaq  was and respectively  per share 
on march  we sold  shares of our common stock to altana at a purchase price of per share 
on march  the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on nasdaq  was per share 
each of these issuances of stock at below the then current market price had a dilutive effect on existing common stockholders 
we have never paid dividends 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  to support our growth strategy 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future

when used in the following discussions  the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  plans  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and contingencies that could cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such statements 
see the forward looking statements section in part i  item overview nanophase technologies is a nanocrystalline materials developer and commercial manufacturer with an integrated family of nanomaterial technologies 
nanophase produces engineered nanomaterials for use in a variety of diverse markets sunscreens  personal care  abrasion resistant applications  antimicrobial products and a variety of polishing applications  including semiconductors and optics 
the company targets markets in which it feels practical solutions may be found using nanoengineered products 
the company works closely with leaders in these target markets to identify their material and performance requirements 
newer developed technologies have made certain new products possible and opened potential new markets 
with the commercialization of the company s nanoarc synthesis and new dispersion technologies in  and the expansion of these capabilities in and  nanophase is focusing on penetrating the chemical mechanical planarization cmp and fine polishing markets 
cmp is the process of polishing various types of integrated circuits or chips to be used in various commercial electronics applications 
management believes that the company s inroads in the cmp and fine polishing markets would have been very difficult without the company being able to produce its materials to exacting specifications verified by in house and customer based testing 
management expects growth in end user customers of nanophase s customers adoption in and revenue growth to continue in in both of these areas 
additionally  the company feels that its exclusive relationship with altana chemie altana  a global ingredients supplier to various coatings industries  will lead to growth in several of its abrasion resistant applications in the marketplace 
nanophase shipped initial quantities of material to altana in the second  third and fourth quarters of  and also throughout management expects this relationship to continue to develop in in may of  basf announced the introduction of a new coated sunscreen material 
this material incorporated a new coating developed by nanophase which  management believes  should help to expand sales in the european and asian markets beginning in on november   byk chemie usa  a subsidiary of altana and a customer of nanophase  lent  to nanophase pursuant to the terms of a promissory note received effective october  this loan was for the purchase and installation of additional dispersion capacity and an additional nanoarc synthesis reactor to allow both for quicker material and application development  which should help to speed market penetration  and the ability to fulfill orders on a commercial scale for additional materials in varying media 

table of contents from its inception in november through december   the company was in the development stage 
during that period  the company primarily focused on the development of its manufacturing processes in order to transition from laboratory scale to commercial scale production 
as a result  the company developed an operating capacity to produce significant quantities of its nanocrystalline materials for commercial sale 
the company was also engaged in the development of commercial applications and formulations and the recruiting of marketing  technical and administrative personnel 
since january   the company has been engaged in commercial production and sales of its nanocrystalline materials  and the company no longer considers itself in the development stage 
from inception through december   the company was primarily capitalized through the private offering of approximately million of equity securities prior to its initial public offering  its initial public offering of million of common stock in november of  its private offering of million of common stock in may of  its private offering of million of common stock in september of  its equity investment of million in march and its private offering of million of common stock in september of through the conversion of warrants that were attached to its september offering  each net of issuance costs 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception through december  critical accounting policies nanophase utilizes certain accounting measurements under applicable generally accepted accounting principles that involve the exercise of management s judgment about subjective factors and estimates about the effect of matters which are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of those accounting measurements that involve business judgments which we believe are most critical to our reported results of operations and financial condition 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements 
trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables  typically based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
inventory valuation 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  maintained on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company has recorded allowances to reduce inventory relating to excess quantities of certain materials 
write downs of inventories establish a new cost basis  which is not increased for future increases in market value of inventories or changes in estimated excess quantities 
if expected demand were either to unexpectedly accelerate or diminish for materials currently in inventory  this could cause management s estimates to become inaccurate resulting in potential increases in inventory allowances in the case of diminished demand  reducing gross margins or potential enhancements to gross margins caused by demand for items previously thought to have reduced near term marketability 
deferred other revenue 
in connection with its promissory note to byk chemie see note  the company recorded  of deferred other revenue 
the note requires that the company give byk chemie first preference in use of the new equipment commissioned under this note and the company has also agreed to provide experimental product made using this equipment 
the company s performance and delivery of its commitments under the equipment use obligations are not expected to arise until the equipment is commissioned and  accordingly the company has not recognized any of the deferred revenue as of december  as a result of a lack of further specificity with regards to the equipment use obligations  the company intends to recognize the deferred revenue ratably  on a straight line basis over a period beginning with the expected commissioning of the equipment at some point in the second or third quarter of the year ended december  and ending on july   the expected date of the company s final payment under the note 

table of contents asset retirement obligations 
the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation which was recognized in the period it was incurred 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as a component of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated 
the company assesses the recoverability of its assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
if assets are determined to be recoverable  but the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated  the net book value of the assets is depreciable over the newly determined remaining useful lives 
revenue recognition 
product revenue consists of sales of product that are recognized when realized and earned 
this occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
other revenue consists of revenue from product development see rhem discussion in note  technology license fees and the sale of production equipment that is designed and built by the company 
such sale of equipment last occurred in the first quarter of these types of equipment sales are treated as other revenue 
this transaction is discussed in further detail below 
technology license fees are recognized when earned pursuant to the contractual arrangement 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenue increased to  in  compared to  in a substantial majority of the company s revenue for the year ended december  is from the company s three largest customers 
see note to the financial statements for additional information regarding the revenue the company derived from these three customers for the year ended december  product revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in product revenue was primarily attributed to increased sales of sunscreen and personal care materials to basf  the company s largest customer  increased sales of cmp materials to rohm and haas electronic materials cmp  inc rhem  formerly known as rodel  inc and a new customer for application in medical devices in the second quarter of the company and its largest customer currently have a technology agreement in place that has led to the joint development of the second generation of sunscreen nanomaterials for other potential personal care applications 
management anticipates the launch of one or more new sunscreen or personal care applications in the near future  with related revenue to begin building in other revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in this decrease was primarily attributed to no technology payments being received in  compared to  in from rhem 
these payments from rhem were part of its  commitment in as described below which was amended for in february of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem 
this amendment allows rhem to maintain exclusivity based upon it purchasing lower dollar amounts of nanocrystalline materials  while extending the agreement through this amendment did not require rhem to purchase any materials from the company in  but it did require an aggregate of  be paid to 
table of contents nanophase in four equal quarterly installments in to support on going efforts in joint slurry product development with rhem during this  was fully earned in in october of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem a second time 
this amendment reduced the minimum purchase requirements necessary to maintain the company s exclusivity obligations to rhem by approximately during the reduction reflects the parties recognition of the difficulty in precisely estimating the timing of product development and sales in the semiconductor polishing market 
pursuant to the october amendment  rhem is now obliged to purchase a guaranteed quantity of material in to maintain exclusively  this schedule was agreed upon in accordance with the terms of the amendment 
the majority of the total revenue generated during the year ended december  was from the company s largest customers in the healthcare sunscreens and cmp markets and its new customer second largest customer in the second quarter of for application in medical devices as described above 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements 
cost of revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in cost of revenue was generally attributed to increased revenue volume somewhat offset by decreases in depreciation and the company s continued efficiencies in reducing its variable manufacturing costs on nanomaterials 
improvements to gross margins were primarily due to increased revenue volume  favorable product mix and the completion of a series of process improvements that increased pvs reactor output by in conjunction with a re engineering program that had reduced the expected operational labor cost by on high volume pvs produced nanomaterials 
nanophase expects to maintain an aggressive schedule for new nanomaterial development  primarily using its nanoarc synthesis and dispersion technologies  for targeted applications and new markets throughout at current revenue levels the company has generated a modest positive gross margin 
the company s margins have been impeded by not having enough revenue to absorb the manufacturing overhead that is required to work with current customers and the new ones the company expects to have 
management believes that the current fixed manufacturing cost structure is sufficient to support significantly higher levels of production and resultant product revenue 
the extent to which the company s margins remain positive  as a percentage of total revenue  will be dependent upon revenue mix  revenue volume and the company s ability to continue to cut costs 
as product revenue volume increases  this will result in more of the company s fixed manufacturing costs being absorbed  leading to increased margins 
the company expects to continue reducing its variable product manufacturing costs in but may or may not continue to operate at a positive gross margin in  dependent upon the factors discussed above 
research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  primarily consists of costs associated with the company s development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing the company s manufacturing processes 
the may roll out of basf s new sunscreen was an example of this work 
in another example  the company has been and continues to be engaged in research to enhance its ability to disperse its material in a variety of organic and inorganic media for use as coatings and polishing materials 
much of this work has led to new potential products for use by altana 
now that the company has demonstrated the capability to produce pilot quantities of mixed metal oxides in a single crystal phase  the company does not expect development of further variations on these materials to present material technological challenges 
many of these materials exhibit performance characteristics that can enable them to serve in various catalytic applications 
this development has been driven largely by customer demand 
management is now working on several related commercial applications 
the company expects that this technique should not be difficult to scale to large quantity commercial volumes once application viability and firm demand are established 
the company also has an ongoing advanced engineering effort that is primarily focused on the development of new nanomaterials as well as the refinement of existing nanomaterials 
the company is not certain when or if any significant revenue will be generated from the production of the materials described above 
research and development expense 
table of contents increased to  in  compared to  in this modest increase in research and development expense was mainly attributed to salary expenses 
the company does not expect research and development expense to increase significantly in selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in this modest net increase was primarily attributed to increases in compensation  consulting expenses and audit fees 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in directors and officers and business insurance expenses and legal fees 
a lease accounting adjustment of  was made in the third quarter of this charge was due to the company correcting an error in its prior accounting practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the useful lives used to amortize improvements on leased property 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
interest income increased to  in  compared to  in these increases were primarily due to increased investment yields in  along with an increase of funds available for investment  largely composed of the march  equity investment from altana  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
other income increased to  in  compared to  of other expenses in this net increase was primarily due to the company taking a one time charge in the amount of  for accounting and legal costs associated with the withdrawal of the company s universal shelf registration in august years ended december  and total revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in a substantial majority of the company s revenue for the year ended december  was from the company s three largest customers 
see note to the financial statements for additional information regarding the revenue the company derived from these three customers for the year ended december  product revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in product revenue was primarily attributed to decreased sales of cmp materials to rohm and haas electronic materials cmp  inc rhem  formerly known as rodel  inc  the company s second largest customer in the decrease was partially offset by increased product sales to the company s largest customer and to a lesser extent its new customer  altana chemie ag 
the company and its largest customer currently have a technology agreement in place to jointly develop the second generation of sunscreen nanomaterials and for other potential personal care applications 
other revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase was largely due to revenue in the amount of  for the year ended december  in technology development from rhem 
this technology development from rhem was part of its  commitment in described below 
this increase in revenue was offset in part by  from the sale of a physical vapor synthesis pvs reactor in march of to ci kasei  the company s japanese licensee and third largest customer in that was not repeated in these types of equipment sales occur on occasion not on a regular basis and are treated as other revenue 
in february of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem

the majority of the total revenue generated during the year ended december  was from customers and development partners in the healthcare sunscreens and cmp markets  including the technology development discussed in the preceding paragraph  and came principally from the company s current two largest customers described above 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements 
cost of revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in cost of revenue was generally attributed to lower product revenue volume  decreased depreciation expense and the company s continued efficiencies in reducing its variable manufacturing costs on nanomaterials
