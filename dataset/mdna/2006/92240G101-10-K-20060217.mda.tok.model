item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive summary of consolidated results of operations year ended december  in millions  except per share data net income attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other basic earnings per share attributed to utility group nonregulated group corporate other results for the year ended december   reported earnings were million  or per share compared to million  or per share  in and million  or per share  in of the per share growth over results  the utility group contributed per share  and the nonregulated group contributed per share 
the corporate and other group results of loss per share in reflects an additional contribution to the vectren foundation of million  or million after tax  to sustain its giving program over the next several years 
the contribution is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
utility group results reflect the impact of a regulatory strategy that includes gas utility base rate increases  the recovery of pollution control investments  and a normal temperature adjustment mechanism implemented in its indiana gas territories in october  among other initiatives 
gas utility base rate increases added revenues of approximately million  or million after tax  in compared to and million  or million after tax  in compared to increased revenues associated with recovery of pollution control investments  net of related operating and depreciation expenses  increased operating income million  or million after tax  in compared to and million  or million after tax  in compared to results for the year ended december  also reflect increased margins from generation asset optimization activities 
in addition to higher operating costs  depreciation expense  and unfavorable weather  utility group results were impacted by a million million after tax charge recorded pursuant to the disallowance of ohio gas costs in in  million million after tax was recorded related to this matter 
management estimates that the after tax impact of weather on the electric and gas utility businesses  including the effects of the recently implemented normal temperature adjustment mechanism  was unfavorable million after tax in  unfavorable million after tax in  and unfavorable million after tax in the company experienced significant earnings growth from its primary nonregulated businesses during and earnings from energy marketing and services  coal mining  and utility infrastructure services were million in  million in  and million in the primary business growth was primarily due to increased earnings proliance energy  llc and improved coal mining operations 
synfuel related earnings included in primary business results were million in  million in and million in 
table of contents nonregulated group results for also reflect earnings of million from the company s investment in the haddington energy partnerships  an increase of million compared to results for the year ended december   reflect million in after tax charges related to the write down of the company s broadband businesses 
earnings in reflect after tax gains from the divesture of businesses and investments totaling million after tax 
while consolidated earnings decreased slightly in compared to  earnings per share was further affected by an equity offering of million shares in august of the equity offering generated net proceeds after issuance expenses of approximately million 
the utility group generates revenue primarily from the delivery of natural gas and electric service to its customers 
its primary source of cash flow results from the collection of customer bills and the payment for goods and services procured for the delivery of gas and electric services 
the utility group s results are impacted by weather patterns in its service territory and general economic conditions both in its indiana and ohio service territories as well as nationally 
the nonregulated group generates revenue or earnings from the provision of services to customers 
the activities of the nonregulated group are closely linked to the utility industry  and the results of those operations are generally impacted by factors similar to those impacting the overall utility industry 
in this discussion and analysis of results of operations  the results of the utility group and nonregulated group are presented on a per share basis 
such per share amounts are based on the earnings contribution of each group included in vectren s consolidated results divided by vectren s average shares outstanding during the period 
the earnings per share of the groups do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to either group but rather represent a direct equity interest in vectren corporation s assets and liabilities as a whole 
the company has in place a disclosure committee that consists of senior management as well as financial management 
the committee is actively involved in the preparation and review of the company s sec filings 
dividends dividends declared for the year ended december   were per share compared to per share in and per share in in october  the company s board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to per share from per share 
detailed discussion of results of operations following is a more detailed discussion of the results of operations of the company s utility group and nonregulated group 
the detailed results of operations for the utility group and nonregulated group are presented and analyzed before the reclassification and elimination of certain intersegment transactions necessary to consolidate those results into the company s consolidated statements of income 
other than the million contribution made in to the vectren foundation discussed above  corporate and other operations are not significant 
results of operations of the utility group the utility group is comprised of vectren utility holdings  inc s utility holdings operations 
the operations of utility holdings consist of the company s regulated operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations 
the company segregates its regulated operations into a gas utility services operating segment and an electric utility services operating segment 
the gas utility services segment provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two thirds of indiana and to west central ohio 
the electric utility services segment provides electric distribution services primarily to southwestern indiana  and includes the company s power generating and marketing operations 
in total  these regulated operations supply natural gas and or electricity to over one million customers 
the results of operations of the utility group before certain intersegment eliminations and reclassifications for the years ended december    and  follow 
table of contents year ended december  in millions  except per share data operating revenues gas utility electric utility other total operating revenues operating expenses cost of gas sold fuel for electric generation purchased electric energy other operating depreciation amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income expense equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates other net total other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic earnings per share the utility group s earnings were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the improved performance is primarily due to gas base rate increases implemented in and early  which added revenue of million  or million after tax  compared to the recovery of pollution control investments  net of related operating and depreciation expense  increased operating income million  or million after tax  compared to the prior year 
in addition  margins from generation asset optimization activities increased due to increased availability of the generating units 
the improved utility margins were partially offset by higher operating and depreciation expense 
the results also reflect a million  million after tax  charge recorded pursuant to the disallowance of ohio gas costs 
year over year  management estimates the effects of weather  as adjusted for a recently implemented normal temperature adjustment mechanism  increased earnings approximately million after tax 
the million decrease in earnings occurring in compared to was primarily due to unfavorable weather estimated at million after tax 
margin growth  offsetting the weather impact  resulted from the recovery of nox related environmental expenditures  gas base rate increases implemented in  and customer growth 
the primary expense changes were higher depreciation and lower bad debt expense in bad debt expense in associated with the ohio service territory was reversed and deferred for later recovery under an uncollectible accounts expense rider 
during and  the company initiated base rate cases in its three gas service territories 
orders in its two indiana service territories were received in the second half of  and the order in the ohio territory was received early in the second quarter of on an annual basis  these orders allow for additional revenues approximating million 
the company has sought and received regulatory recovery mechanisms trackers affecting electric margin that provide a return on utility plant constructed for environmental compliance and that allow for recovery of related operating expenses 
after tax earnings associated with the environmental compliance trackers totaled million in  million in  and million in the company recently implemented a normal temperature adjustment mechanism in its indiana gas service territories and also utilizes regulatory trackers affecting gas margin that recover  on a dollar for dollar basis  pipeline integrity management costs in its indiana territories and uncollectible accounts expense and other costs in its ohio service territory 

table of contents significant fluctuations utility group margin throughout this discussion  the terms gas utility margin and electric utility margin are used 
gas utility margin is calculated as gas utility revenues less the cost of gas 
electric utility margin is calculated as electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy 
these measures exclude other operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  and taxes other than income taxes  which are included in the calculation of operating income 
the company believes gas utility and electric utility margins are better indicators of relative contribution than revenues since gas prices and fuel costs can be volatile and are generally collected on a dollar for dollar basis from customers 
margin generated from the sale of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers is seasonal and impacted by weather patterns in the company s service territories 
the weather impact in the company s indiana gas utility service territories is mitigated somewhat by a normal temperature adjustment mechanism  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of margin generated from sales to large customers generally industrial  other contract  and firm wholesale customers is primarily impacted by overall economic conditions 
margin is also impacted by the collection of state mandated taxes  which fluctuate with gas costs  as well as other tracked expenses and is also impacted by some level of price sensitivity in volumes sold 
electric generating asset optimization activities are primarily affected by market conditions  the level of excess generating capacity  and electric transmission availability 
following is a discussion and analysis of margin generated from regulated utility operations 
gas utility margin gas utility revenues less cost of gas sold gas utility margin and throughput by customer type follows year ended december  in millions gas utility revenues cost of gas sold total gas utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers other customers sold transported volumes in mmdth attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers total sold transported volumes gas utility margins were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the increase is primarily due to the favorable impact of gas base rate increases of million and additional pass through expenses and revenue taxes recovered in margins of million compared to last year 
results for the year ended december   reflect a million charge for the impact of the disallowance of ohio gas costs ordered by the puco 
for the year ended december   weather was warmer than normal but colder than the prior year 
management estimates that weather  including of the effects of the normal temperature adjustment mechanism  increased margin an estimated million compared to though estimated to be modest to date and net of customer growth  management has seen evidence of gas customer usage declines in  assumed to be driven primarily by price sensitivity 
with the current outlook for continued high gas commodity prices  management expects that trend to continue and or accelerate in the average cost per dekatherm of gas purchased was in  in  and in 
table of contents gas utility margins were and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and this represents a decrease in gas utility margin of million compared to heating weather for the year ended december   was warmer than normal and warmer than the estimated unfavorable impact on gas utility margin caused by weather was approximately million compared to indiana base rate increases added million compared to the prior year 
also offsetting the effects of weather were increased late and reconnect fees  expense recovery pursuant to ohio regulatory trackers  and higher revenue taxes collected from rate payers 
gas sold and transported volumes were less in  compared to the prior year 
the decreased throughput was primarily attributable to weather 
electric utility margin electric utility revenues less fuel for electric generation and purchased electric energy electric utility margin and volume sold by customer type follows year ended december  in millions electric utility revenues fuel for electric generation purchased electric energy total electric utility margin margin attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipalities other customers subtotal retail firm wholesale asset optimization electric volumes sold in gwh attributed to residential commercial customers industrial customers municipal other customers total retail firm wholesale volumes sold retail firm wholesale margin electric retail and firm wholesale utility margin was million for the year ended december   an increase over the prior year of million 
the recovery of pollution control related investments and associated operating expenses and depreciation expense increased margins million compared to cooling weather was warmer than normal and warmer than last year 
the estimated increase in electric margin related to weather was million compared to the prior year million related to cooling weather and million related to heating weather 
electric retail and firm wholesale margin was million for the year ended december  this represents a million increase over additional nox recoveries increased margin million in cooling weather for the year was warmer than  increasing margin an estimated million 
the remaining increase in margin was attributable to increased small customer usage and increased sales to industrial customers 
margin from asset optimization activities periodically  generation capacity is in excess of that needed to serve retail load and firm wholesale customers 
the company markets this unutilized capacity to optimize the return on its owned generation assets 
substantially all of the margin from these activities is generated from contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery and are short term purchase and sale transactions that expose the company to limited market risk 
beginning in april  substantially all off system sales occur into the miso day ahead market 

table of contents following is a reconciliation of asset optimization activity year ended december  in millions beginning of year net balance sheet position statement of income activity mark to market gains losses recognized realized gains net activity in electric utility margin net cash received other adjustments end of year net balance sheet position for the year ended december   net asset optimization margins were million  which represents an increase of million  as compared to the increase in margin results primarily from the timing of available capacity and mark to market gains 
net asset optimization margins decreased million in as compared to due to reduced available capacity 
in  the company experienced increased availability of the generating units 
the availability of excess capacity was reduced in by scheduled outages of owned generation related to the installation of environmental compliance equipment 
off system sales totaled  gwh in  compared to gwh in and gwh in utility group operating expenses other operating other operating expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to amortization of rate case expenses  expenses associated with the ohio choice program and integrity management programs  and expenses recovered through margin increased million 
bad debt expense in the company s indiana service territories was million in  an increase of million compared to compensation and benefit costs increases  including performance and share based compensation was million higher than the prior year  reflective of the return to higher earnings in as compared to higher maintenance  chemical costs  and all other costs account for million of the increase 
other operating expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to expense in reflects the deferral of million relating to the ohio order allowing the company to defer for future recovery its actual bad debt expense in excess of the amount provided in base rates see rate and regulatory matters below 
other factors contributing to the increase were an increase in environmental compliance related expenses of million recovered in rates and planned turbine maintenance of million 
depreciation amortization depreciation expense increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to in addition to depreciation on additions to plant in service  the increases were primarily due to incremental depreciation expense associated with environmental compliance equiptment additions 
depreciation expense associated with environmental compliance equiptment  which is recovered in electric utility margins  totaled million in  million in  and million in results for include million of lower depreciation due to adjustments of ohio depreciation rates and amortization of indiana regulatory assets 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to  and million in compared to these increases are primarily attributable to increased collections of utility receipts and excise taxes due to higher revenues 

table of contents utility group other income expense total other income expense net decreased million in compared to  and increased million during compared to lower amounts of afudc were recorded in compared to and in compared to as environmental compliance expenditures were placed in service 
fiscal year includes operating losses and the write off of investments in an entity that processed fly ash  totaling million 
utility group interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to the increase was driven by rising interest rates and higher levels of short term borrowings due in part to higher working capital requirements resulting from the increased gas commodity prices 
in november  the company completed permanent financing transactions in which approximately million in debt and interest rate swap settlement proceeds were received and used to retire higher coupon long term debt and other short term borrowings 
in the second half of  the company completed permanent financing transactions in which approximately million in equity  debt  and hedging net proceeds were received and used to retire higher coupon long term debt and other short term borrowings 
the changes in interest expense in and reflect the full impact of that transaction 
utility group income taxes federal and state income taxes increased million in compared to due primarily to increased pre tax income as compared to the prior year and adjustments to accruals resulting from the conclusion of state tax audits and other adjustments 
income taxes in were relatively consistent with with decreased earnings offset by a slightly higher effective rate 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  and local regulations with respect to environmental matters  principally air  solid waste  and water quality 
pursuant to environmental regulations  the company is required to obtain operating permits for the electric generating plants that it owns or operates and construction permits for any new plants it might propose to build 
regulations concerning air quality establish standards with respect to both ambient air quality and emissions from electric generating facilities  including particulate matter  sulfur dioxide so  and nitrogen oxide nox 
regulations concerning water quality establish standards relating to intake and discharge of water from electric generating facilities  including water used for cooling purposes in electric generating facilities 
because of the scope and complexity of these regulations  the company is unable to predict the ultimate effect of such regulations on its future operations  nor is it possible to predict what other regulations may be adopted in the future 
the company intends to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  but will contest any regulation it deems to be unreasonable or impossible with which to comply 
clean air act nox sip call matter the company has taken steps to comply with indiana s state implementation plan sip of the clean air act the act 
these steps include installing selective catalytic reduction scr systems at culley generating station unit culley  warrick generating station unit  and a 
b 
brown generating station units and scr systems reduce flue gas nox emissions to atmospheric nitrogen and water using ammonia in a chemical reaction 
this technology is known to currently be the most effective method of reducing nitrogen oxide nox emissions where high removal efficiencies are required 
the iurc has issued orders that approve the company s project to achieve environmental compliance by investing in clean coal technology  a total capital cost investment for this project up to million excluding afudc and administrative overheads  subject to periodic review of the actual costs incurred  a mechanism whereby  prior to an electric base rate case  the company may recover through a rider that is updated every six months  an return on its weighted capital costs for the project  and ongoing recovery of operating costs  including depreciation and purchased emission allowances  related to the clean coal technology once the facility is placed into service 

table of contents through december   capital investments approximating the level approved by the iurc have been made 
the last scr was placed into service in may  related annual operating expenses  including depreciation expense  were million in  million in and million in such operating expenses could approximate to million once all installed equipment is operational for an entire year 
the company has achieved timely compliance through the reduction of the company s overall nox emissions to levels compliant with indiana s nox emissions budget allotted by the usepa 
therefore  the company has recorded no accrual for potential penalties that may result from noncompliance 
clean air interstate rule clean air mercury rule in march of usepa finalized two new air emission reduction regulations 
the clean air interstate rule cair is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide so emissions from coal burning power plants 
the clean air mercury rule camr is an allowance cap and trade program requiring further reductions in mercury emissions from coal burning power plants 
both sets of regulations require emission reductions in two phases 
the first phase deadline for both rules is for nox under cair  and the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reductions required under cair is  while the second phase deadline for compliance with the emission reduction requirements of camr is the company is evaluating compliance options and fully expects to be in compliance by the required deadlines 
in may  vectren s utility subsidiary  sigeco  filed a new multi emission compliance plan with the iurc 
if approved  sigeco s coal fired plants will be scrubbed for so  scrubbed for nox  and mercury emissions will be reduced to meet the new mercury reduction standards 
on october   the company and the oucc filed with the iurc a settlement agreement concerning the regulatory treatment and recovery of the investment required by this plan 
on december   sigeco  the oucc and citizens action coalition filed a supplement to the settlement in which sigeco agreed to study renewable energy alternatives and to include a carbon forecast in future filings with regard to new generation and further environmental compliance plans  among other initiatives 
if the settlement agreement is approved  the company will recover an approximate return on its capital investments  which are expected to approximate million  and related operating expenses through a rider mechanism 
this rider mechanism will operate similar to the rider used to recover nox related capital investments and operating expenses 
the company expects a final order from the iurc related to this settlement agreement in early culley generating station litigation during  the us district court for the southern district of indiana entered a consent decree among sigeco  the department of justice doj  and the usepa that resolved a lawsuit originally brought by the usepa against sigeco 
the lawsuit alleged violations of the clean air act by sigeco at its culley generating station for making modifications to a generating station without obtaining required permits  making major modifications to the generating station without installing the best available emission control technology  and failing to notify the usepa of the modifications 
under the terms of the agreement  the doj and usepa agreed to drop all challenges of past maintenance and repair activities at the culley generating station 
in reaching the agreement  sigeco did not admit to any allegations in the government s complaint  and sigeco continues to believe that it acted in accordance with applicable regulations and conducted only routine maintenance on the units 
sigeco entered into this agreement to further its continued commitment to improve air quality and avoid the cost and uncertainties of litigation 

table of contents under the agreement  sigeco committed to either repower culley unit mw with natural gas and equip it with scr control technology for further reduction of nitrogen oxide  or cease operation of the unit by december   operate the existing scr control technology recently installed on culley unit mw year round at a lower emission rate than that currently required under the nox sip call  resulting in further nitrogen oxide reductions  enhance the efficiency of the existing scrubber at culley units and for additional removal of sulphur dioxide emissions  install a baghouse for further particulate matter reductions at culley unit by june   conduct a sulphuric acid reduction demonstration project as an environmental mitigation project designed to demonstrate an advance in pollution control technology for the reduction of sulfate emissions  and pay a  civil penalty 
the company notified the usepa of its intention to shut down culley unit effective december  the company does not believe that implementation of the settlement will have a material effect to its results from operations or financial condition 
the  civil penalty was expensed and paid during and is reflected in other net 
manufactured gas plants in the past  indiana gas  sigeco  and others operated facilities for the manufacture of gas 
given the availability of natural gas transported by pipelines  these facilities have not been operated for many years 
under currently applicable environmental laws and regulations  indiana gas  sigeco  and others may now be required to take remedial action if certain byproducts are found above the regulatory thresholds at these sites 
indiana gas has identified the existence  location  and certain general characteristics of gas manufacturing and storage sites for which it may have some remedial responsibility 
indiana gas has completed a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs at one of the sites under an agreed order between indiana gas and the idem  and a record of decision was issued by the idem in january although indiana gas has not begun an ri fs at additional sites  indiana gas has submitted several of the sites to the idem s voluntary remediation program vrp and is currently conducting some level of remedial activities  including groundwater monitoring at certain sites  where deemed appropriate  and will continue remedial activities at the sites as appropriate and necessary 
in conjunction with data compiled by environmental consultants  indiana gas has accrued the estimated costs for further investigation  remediation  groundwater monitoring  and related costs for the sites 
while the total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time  indiana gas has recorded costs that it reasonably expects to incur totaling approximately million 
the estimated accrued costs are limited to indiana gas proportionate share of the remediation efforts 
indiana gas has arrangements in place for of the sites with other potentially responsible parties prp  which serve to limit indiana gas share of response costs at these sites to between and 
with respect to insurance coverage  indiana gas has received and recorded settlements from all known insurance carriers in an aggregate amount approximating million 
environmental matters related to manufactured gas plants have had no material impact on earnings since costs recorded to date approximate prp and insurance settlement recoveries 
while indiana gas has recorded all costs which it presently expects to incur in connection with activities at these sites  it is possible that future events may require some level of additional remedial activities which are not presently foreseen 
in october  the company received a formal information request letter from the idem regarding five manufactured gas plants owned and or operated by sigeco and not currently enrolled in the idem s vrp 
in response  sigeco submitted to the idem the results of preliminary site investigations conducted in the mid s 
these site investigations confirmed that based upon the conditions known at the time  the sites posed no risk to human health or the environment 
follow up reviews have been initiated by the company to confirm that the sites continue to pose no such risk 

table of contents on october   sigeco filed applications to enter four of the manufactured gas plant sites in idem s vrp 
the remaining site is currently being addressed in the vrp by another indiana utility 
sigeco added those four sites into the renewal of the global voluntary remediation agreement that indiana gas has in place with idem for its manufactured gas plant sites 
that renewal was approved by the idem on february  on july   sigeco filed a declaratory judgment action against its insurance carriers seeking a judgment finding its carriers liable under the policies for coverage of further investigation and any necessary remediation costs that sigeco may accrue under the vrp program 
costs of remediation at the four sigeco sites  as well as the amount of any prp or insurance recoveries  cannot be determined at this time 
the total costs accrued to date  including investigative costs  have been immaterial 
jacobsville superfund site on july   the usepa listed the jacobsville neighborhood soil contamination site in evansville  indiana  on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the usepa has identified four sources of historic lead contamination 
these four sources shut down manufacturing operations years ago 
when drawing up the boundaries for the listing  the usepa included a acre block of properties surrounding the jacobsville neighborhood  including vectren s wagner operations center 
vectren s property has not been named as a source of the lead contamination  nor does the usepa s soil testing to date indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
vectren s own soil testing  completed during the construction of the operations center  did not indicate that the vectren property contains lead contaminated soils 
at this time  vectren anticipates only additional soil testing  if required by the usepa 
rate and regulatory matters gas and electric operations with regard to retail rates and charges  terms of service  accounting matters  issuance of securities  and certain other operational matters specific to its indiana customers are regulated by the iurc 
the retail gas operations of the ohio operations are subject to regulation by the puco 
all metered gas rates in indiana contain a gas cost adjustment gca clause  and all metered gas rates in ohio contain a gas cost recovery gcr clause 
gca and gcr clauses allow the company to charge for changes in the cost of purchased gas 
metered electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause fac that allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to reflect changes in the cost of fuel 
the net energy cost of purchased power  subject to an agreed upon benchmark  is also recovered through regulatory proceedings 
gca  gcr  and fac procedures involve periodic filings and iurc and puco hearings to establish the amount of price adjustments for a designated future period 
the procedures also provide for inclusion in later periods of any variances between the estimated cost of gas  cost of fuel  and net energy cost of purchased power and actual costs incurred 
the company records any under or over recovery resulting from gas and fuel adjustment clauses each month in margin 
a corresponding asset or liability is recorded until the under or over recovery is billed or refunded to utility customers 
the iurc has also applied the statute authorizing gca and fac procedures to reduce rates when necessary to limit net operating income to a level authorized in its last general rate order through the application of an earnings test 
for the recent past  the earnings test has not affected the company s ability to recover costs 
weather normalization on october   the iurc approved the establishment of a normal temperature adjustment nta mechanism for vectren energy delivery of indiana 
the oucc had previously entered into a settlement agreement with vectren energy delivery of indiana providing for the nta 
the nta affects the company s indiana regulated residential and commercial natural gas customers and should mitigate weather risk in those customer classes during the october to april heating season 
these indiana customer classes represent approximately of the company s total natural gas heating load 

table of contents the nta mechanism will mitigate volatility in distribution charges created by fluctuations in weather by lowering customer bills when weather is colder than normal and increasing customer bills when weather is warmer than normal 
the nta has been applied to meters read and bills rendered after october  each subsequent monthly bill for the seven month heating season will be adjusted using the nta 
the order provides that the company will make  on a monthly basis  a commitment of  to a universal service fund program or other low income assistance program for the duration of the nta or until a general rate case 
rate structures in the company s indiana electric territory and ohio gas territory do not include weather normalization type clauses 
gas utility base rate settlements on june   the iurc approved a million base rate increase for sigeco s gas distribution business  and on november   approved a million base rate increase for indiana gas gas distribution business 
on april   the puco approved a million base rate increase for vedo s gas distribution business 
the new rate designs in all three territories include a larger service charge  which is intended to address to some extent earnings volatility related to weather 
the base rate change in sigeco s service territory was implemented on july   the base rate change in indiana gas service territory was implemented on december   and the base rate change in vedo s service territory was implemented on april  the orders also permit sigeco and indiana gas to recover the on going costs to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of the pipeline safety improvement tracker provides for the recovery of incremental non capital dollars  capped at  the first year and  thereafter for sigeco and million per year for indiana gas 
any costs incurred in excess of these annual caps are to be deferred for future recovery 
vedo s new base rates provide for the recovery of on going costs to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of as well as the funding of conservation programs 
indiana and ohio decoupling conservation filings on october   vectren energy delivery of indiana filed with the iurc for approval of a conservation program and a conservation adjustment rider in its two indiana gas service territories 
if approved  the plan outlined in the petition will better align the interests of the company with its customers through the promotion of natural gas conservation 
the petition requests the use of a tracker mechanism to recover the costs of funding the design and implementation of conservation efforts  such as consumer education programs and rebates for high efficiency equipment 
the conservation tracker works in tandem with a decoupling mechanism 
the decoupling mechanism would allow the company to recover the distribution portion of its rates from residential and commercial customers based on the level of customer usage established in each utility s last general rate case 
the company will file its evidence in march and a hearing is set for june similarly  on november   vectren energy delivery of ohio filed with the puco for approval of a conservation program and a conservation adjustment rider that would accomplish the same objectives 
discussions with interested parties are ongoing in both states 
miso since february  and with the iurc s approval  the company has been a member of the midwest independent system operator  inc miso  a ferc approved regional transmission organization 
the miso serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midwest and maintains operational control over the company s electric transmission facilities as well as that of other midwest utilities 
pursuant to an order from the iurc received in december  certain miso startup costs referred to as day costs have been deferred for future recovery in the next general rate case 

table of contents on april   the miso energy market commenced operation the day energy market 
as a result of being a market participant  the company now bids its owned generation into the day ahead and real time markets and procures power for its retail customers at locational marginal pricing lmp as determined by the miso market 
on june   vectren  together with three other indiana electric utilities  received regulatory authority from the iurc that allows recovery of fuel related costs and deferral of other costs associated with the day energy market 
the order allows fuel related costs to be passed through to customers in vectren s existing fuel cost recovery proceedings 
the other non fuel and miso administrative related costs are to be deferred for recovery as part of the next electric general rate case proceeding 
as a result of miso s operational control over much of the midwestern electric transmission grid  including sigeco s transmission facilities  sigeco s continued ability to import power  when necessary  and export power to the wholesale market has been  and may continue to be  impacted 
given the nature of miso s policies regarding use of transmission facilities  as well as ongoing ferc initiatives and uncertainties around day energy market operations  it is difficult to predict near term operational impacts 
however  as stated above  it is believed that miso s regional operation of the transmission system will ultimately lead to reliability improvements 
the potential need to expend capital for improvements to the transmission system  both to sigeco s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities  over the next several years will become more predictable as miso completes studies related to regional transmission planning and improvements 
such expenditures may be significant 
gas cost recovery gcr audit proceedings on june   the puco issued an order disallowing the recovery of approximately million of gas costs relating to the two year audit period ended november that audit period provided the puco staff its initial review of the portfolio administration arrangement between vedo and proliance 
the disallowance includes approximately million relating to pipeline refunds and penalties and approximately million of costs for winter delivery services purchased by vedo to ensure reliability over the two year period 
the puco also held that proliance should have credited to vedo an additional million more than credits actually received for the right to use vedo s gas transportation capacity periodically during the periods when it was not required for serving vedo s customers 
the puco also directed vedo to either submit its receipt of portfolio administration services to a request for proposal process or to in source those functions 
during  the company recorded a reserve of million for this matter 
an additional pretax charge of million was recorded in cost of gas sold in the reserve reflects management s assessment of the impact of the puco decisions  an estimate of any current impact that decision may have on subsequent audit periods  and an estimate of a sharing in any final disallowance by vectren s partner in proliance 
vedo filed its request for rehearing on july   and on august   the puco granted rehearing to further consider the million portfolio administration issue and all interest on the findings  but denied rehearing on all other aspects of the case 
on october   the company filed an appeal with the ohio supreme court requesting that the million disallowance related to the winter delivery service issue be reversed 
that appeal is pending with briefing scheduled to be completed in february  in addition  the company solicited and received bids for vedo s gas supply and portfolio administration services and has selected a third party provider  who began providing services to vedo on november   under a one year contract 
on december   the puco granted in part vedo s rehearing request  and reduced the million disallowance related to portfolio administration to million 
the company is considering whether to appeal that decision 
ohio uncollectible accounts expense tracker on december   the puco approved a request by vedo and several other regulated ohio gas utilities to establish a mechanism to recover uncollectible account expense outside of base rates 
the tariff mechanism establishes an automatic adjustment procedure to track and recover these costs instead of providing the recovery of the historic amount in base rates

huntsville utilities asserted claims based on alleged breach of contract with respect to the provision of portfolio services and or pricing advice  fraud  fraudulent inducement  and other theories  including conversion and violations under the racketeering  influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
these claims related generally to alleged breach of contract in providing advice and or administering portfolio arrangements  alleged promises to provide gas at a below market rate  the creation and repayment of a winter levelizing program instituted by proliance in conjunction with the manager of huntsville s gas utility to allow huntsville utilities to pay its natural gas bills from the winter of over an extended period of time coupled with the alleged ignorance about the program on the part of huntsville utilities gas board and other management  and  conversion of huntsville utilities gas storage supplies to repay the balance owed on the winter levelizing program and the alleged lack of authority of huntsville utilities gas manager to approve those sales 
in early  a jury trial commenced and on february   the jury returned a verdict largely in favor of huntsville utilities and awarded huntsville utilities compensatory damages of million and punitive damages of million 
the jury rejected huntsville utilities claim of conversion 
the jury also rejected a counter claim by proliance for payment of amounts due from huntsville utilities 
following that verdict  there were a number of issues presented to the judge for resolution 
huntsville made a claim under federal law that it was entitled to have the compensatory damage award trebled 
the judge rejected that request 
proliance made a claim against huntsville for unjust enrichment  which was also rejected by the judge 
the judge also determined that attorneys fees and prejudgment interest are owed by proliance to huntsville utilities 
the verdict  as affected by the judge s subsequent rulings  totals million  and proliance has posted an appeal bond for that estimated amount 
proliance s management believes there are reasonable grounds for appeal which offer a basis for reversal of the entire verdict  and initiated the appeal process on july  the appeal will not be fully briefed until early the earliest an appellate decision might be issued would be in late while it is reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred by proliance  it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of an appeal of the verdict 
proliance recorded a reserve of million as of december   reflective of their assessment of the lower end of the range of potential exposure on certain issues identified in the case and inclusive of estimated ongoing litigation costs 
amounts due from huntsville utilities were fully reserved by proliance in as an equity investor in proliance  the company reflected its share of the charge  or million after tax  in its fourth quarter results 
that charge does not reflect the possibility that some actual losses might be recovered from insurance carriers  as to which there can be no assurance

pace carbon developed  owns  and operates four projects to produce and sell coal based synthetic fuel synfuel utilizing covol technology 
vectren accounts for its investment in pace carbon using the equity method 
in addition  fuels receives synfuel related fees from a synfuel producer unrelated to pace carbon for a portion of its coal production 
coal mining net income for the year ended december   was million  as compared to million in  and million in earnings from mining operations were million in  compared to million in and a loss of million in the increased performance is primarily due to greater production  improved yield and higher prices  despite the effects of rising costs for steel  explosives  and diesel fuel in and the company produced million tons of coal in  compared to million tons in and million tons in synfuel related results  which include earnings from pace carbon and synfuel processing fees earned by fuels  were million in  million in  and million in the decrease reflects lower synfuel processing fees earned by fuels and costs associated with protecting section tax credits from oil price risk 
the decrease reflects lower production of synthetic fuel produced by pace carbon due to feedstock problems at one of their four plants 
the underperforming plant was relocated and began production in january an additional plant was relocated  due to feedstock problems  on the fourth quarter of and began production in december the production of synthetic fuel generates section tax credits that are utilized by the company  reducing income tax expense in those years 
section tax credit developments under section of the internal revenue code  manufacturers such as pace carbon receive a tax credit for every ton of synthetic fuel sold 
to qualify for the credits  the synthetic fuel must meet three primary conditions there must be a significant chemical change in the coal feedstock  the product must be sold to an unrelated person  and the production facility must have been placed in service before july  in past rulings  the internal revenue service irs has concluded that the synthetic fuel produced at the pace carbon facilities should qualify for section tax credits 
the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to the four projects on november   and subsequently issued an updated private letter ruling on september  as a partner in pace carbon  vectren has reflected total tax credits under section in its consolidated results from inception through december   of approximately million

primarily from the use of these credits  the company generated an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward in and as a result  the company has an accumulated amt credit carryforward of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
during june  the irs began a tax audit of pace carbon for the tax year and later expanded the audit to include tax years   and in may  the irs completed its audit of the to tax returns of pace carbon requesting only minor modifications to previously filed returns 
there were no changes to any of the filed section tax credit calculations 
the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the us senate s committee on governmental affairs  however  has an ongoing investigation related to section tax credits 
vectren believes it is justified in its reliance on the private letter rulings and most recent irs audit results for the pace carbon facilities 
further  section tax credits are only available when the price of oil is less than a base price specified by the tax code  as adjusted for inflation 
credits realized in or in prior years are not affected by the limitation 
however  an average nymex price of approximately per barrel in  could begin to limit section tax credits  with a total phase out occurring at approximately per barrel 
oil prices currently exceed the threshold where section tax credits would begin to be phased out 
while congress is considering legislation that would positively impact or entirely negate this potential limitation on tax credits related to oil prices in  there can be no assurance section tax credits will be available in future periods

fin clarifies that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within sfas s scope 
it also clarifies the meaning of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation aro that is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be estimated reasonably 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted this interpretation on december  the primary issue resulting from fin s adoption was the reassessment of whether a portion of removal costs accrued through depreciation rates established in regulatory proceedings should be recharacterized as an aro 
the adoption of this interpretation established an approximate million aro for interim retirements of gas utility pipeline and utility poles and certain asbestos related issues  the majority of which was already accrued as a cost of removal regulatory liability 
the aro is included in other liabilities and deferred credits 
adoption also resulted in an increase to utility plant of approximately million

table of contents critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain estimates used in the financial statements are subjective and use variables that require judgment 
these include the estimates to perform goodwill and other asset impairments tests and to determine pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the company makes other estimates in the course of accounting for unbilled revenue and the effects of regulation that are critical to the company s financial results but that are less likely to be impacted by near term changes 
other estimates that significantly affect the company s results  but are not necessarily critical to operations  include depreciating utility and non utility plant  valuing derivative contracts  and estimating uncollectible accounts  among others 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment review of investments the company has investments in notes receivable  entities accounted for using the cost method of accounting  and entities accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
when events occur that may cause one of these investments to be impaired  the company performs an impairment analysis 
an impairment analysis of notes receivable usually involves the comparison of the investment s estimated free cash flows to the stated terms of the note  or for notes that are collateral dependent  a comparison of the collateral s fair value to the carrying amount of the note 
an impairment analysis of cost method and equity method investments involves comparison of the investment s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
fair value is estimated using market comparisons  appraisals  and or discounted cash flow analyses 
calculating free cash flows and fair value using the above methods is subjective and requires judgment concerning growth assumptions  longevity of cash flows  and discount rates for fair value calculations 
during  the company performed an impairment analysis on its utilicom related investments 
the company used free cash flow analyses to estimate fair value for the cost method portion of the utilicom investment and recoverability of the related notes receivable 
an impairment charge totaling million was recorded as a result of the analysis 
a increase in the discount rate assumption utilized to calculate utilicom s fair value would have resulted in an estimated additional million impairment charge to the cost method investment and no additional impairment charge to the notes receivable 
impairment tests on other investments were also conducted using appraisals and discounted cash flow models to estimate fair value 
a million write off of investments in an entity that processed fly ash resulted in goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 the company performs an annual impairment analysis of its goodwill  almost all of which resides in the gas utility services operating segment  at the beginning of each year  and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level 
the company has determined its gas utility services operating segment as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements to be the reporting unit 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
the company used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its gas utility services operating segment  and that estimated fair value was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount in   and and therefore resulted in no impairment 
estimating fair value using a discounted cash flow model is subjective and requires significant judgment in applying a discount rate  growth assumptions  company expense allocations  and longevity of cash flows 
a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized to calculate the gas utility services segment s fair value also would have resulted in no impairment charge

with assistance from legal counsel  management has analyzed the unions position and continues to believe that the company has reserved the right to amend the affected plans and that changing these benefits for retirees is not a mandatory subject of bargaining 
future changes in health care costs  work force demographics  interest rates  or plan changes could significantly affect the estimated cost of these future benefits

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates  and counter party credit 
these financial exposures are monitored and managed by the company as an integral part of its overall risk management program 
the company s risk management program includes  among other things  the use of derivatives 
the company also executes derivative contracts in the normal course of operations while buying and selling commodities to be used in operations and optimizing its generation assets 
the company has in place a risk management committee that consists of senior management as well as financial and operational management 
the committee is actively involved in identifying risks as well as reviewing and authorizing risk mitigation strategies 
commodity price risk regulated operations the company s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for purchases and sales of natural gas and electricity for retail customers due to current indiana and ohio regulations  which subject to compliance with those regulations  allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms 
nevertheless  it is possible regulators may disallow recovery of a portion of gas costs for various reasons  including but not limited to  a finding by the regulator that natural gas was not prudently procured  as an example 
although vectren s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk  volatile natural gas prices can result in higher working capital requirements  increased expenses including unrecoverable interest costs  uncollectible accounts expense  and unaccounted for gas  and some level of price sensitive reduction in volumes sold or delivered 
the company mitigates these risks by executing derivative contracts that manage the price of forecasted natural gas purchases 
these contracts are subject to regulation which allows for reasonable and prudent hedging costs to be recovered through rates 
when regulation is involved  sfas controls when the offset to mark to market accounting is recognized in earnings 
recently  commodity prices for natural gas purchases have increased and have become more volatile 
despite hedging strategies  this near term change in natural gas commodity prices may have significant effects on operating results as described above 
wholesale and other operations electric sales and purchases in the wholesale power market and other commodity related operations are exposed to commodity price risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  and coal 
other commodity related operations include regulated sales of electricity to certain municipalities and large industrial customers and nonregulated retail gas marketing and coal mining operations 
open positions in terms of price  volume  and specified delivery points may occur and are managed using methods described below with frequent management reporting 
the company s wholesale power marketing activities include asset optimization strategies that manage the utilization of available electric generating capacity 
execution of asset optimization strategies require entering into energy contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell electricity in the future 
commodity price risk results from forward positions that commit the company to deliver electricity 
the company mitigates price risk exposure with planned unutilized generation capability and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
the company accounts for asset optimization contracts that are derivatives at fair value with the offset marked to market through earnings 
the company s other commodity related operations involve the purchase and sale of commodities  including electricity  natural gas  and coal to meet customer demands and operational needs 
these operations also enter into forward and option contracts that commit the company to purchase and sell commodities in the future 
price risk from forward positions obligating the company to deliver commodities is mitigated using stored inventory  generating capability  and offsetting forward purchase contracts 
price risk also results from forward contracts obligating the company to purchase commodities to fulfill forecasted nonregulated sales of natural gas and coal that may  or may not  occur 
with the exception of a small portion of contracts that are derivatives that qualify as hedges of forecasted transactions under sfas  these contracts are expected to be settled by physical receipt or delivery of the commodity 

table of contents nonregulated gas retail operations will from time to time purchase weather derivatives to mitigate extreme weather affecting unregulated retail gas sales  and the company may purchase other tailored products that mitigate unique risks involving emission allowances and the effect oil prices may have on the availability of section tax credits 
market risk resulting from commodity contracts is measured by management using the potential impact on pre tax earnings caused by the effect a adverse change in forward commodity prices might have on market sensitive derivative positions outstanding on specific dates 
for the years ended december   and  a adverse change in forward commodity prices would have decreased earnings by million and million  respectively  based upon open positions existing on the last day of those years 
unconsolidated affiliate proliance  a nonregulated energy marketing affiliate  engages in energy hedging activities to manage pricing decisions  minimize the risk of price volatility  and minimize price risk exposure in the energy markets 
proliance s market exposure arises from storage inventory  imbalances  and fixed price forward purchase and sale contracts  which are entered into to support its operating activities 
currently  proliance buys and sells physical commodities and utilizes financial instruments to hedge its market exposure 
however  net open positions in terms of price  volume and specified delivery point do occur 
proliance manages open positions with policies which limit its exposure to market risk and require reporting potential financial exposure to its management and its members 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements 
its risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on interest expense 
the company manages this risk by allowing and of its total debt to be exposed to variable rate volatility 
however  there are times when this targeted range of interest rate exposure may not be attained 
to manage this exposure  the company may use derivative financial instruments 
at december   debt subject to short term interest rate volatility and seasonal increases in short term debt outstanding  represented of the company s total debt portfolio 
market risk is estimated as the potential impact resulting from fluctuations in interest rates on adjustable rate borrowing arrangements exposed to short term interest rate volatility 
during and  the weighted average combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
at december   and  combined borrowings under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
based upon average borrowing rates under these facilities during the years ended december  and  an increase of basis points one percentage point in the rates would have increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
other risks by using forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments to manage risk  the company as well as proliance exposes itself to counter party credit risk and market risk 
the company manages exposure to counter party credit risk by entering into contracts with companies that can be reasonably expected to fully perform under the terms of the contract 
counter party credit risk is monitored regularly and positions are adjusted appropriately to manage risk 
further  tools such as netting arrangements and requests for collateral are also used to manage credit risk 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates 
the company attempts to manage exposure to market risk associated with commodity contracts and interest rates by establishing parameters and monitoring those parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
the company s customer receivables from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services are primarily derived from a diversified base of residential  commercial  and industrial customers located in indiana and west central ohio 
the company manages credit risk associated with its receivables by continually reviewing creditworthiness and requests cash deposits or refunds cash deposits based on that review 
credit risk associated with certain investments is also managed by a review of creditworthiness and receipt of collateral
