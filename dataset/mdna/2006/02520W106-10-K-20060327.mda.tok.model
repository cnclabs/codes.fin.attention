the allowance for loan losses at december  of million represented of total loans and of non performing loans 
the increase in both the provision for loan losses and the increase in the allowance for loan losses in is primarily attributable to the increase in non performing leases

per share in in addition  options to buy stock were exercised in resulting in  in net proceeds 
net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of earnings for bancshares is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as levels of non interest bearing liabilities

provision for income taxes

liquidity and capital resources maintaining adequate liquidity while managing interest rate risk is the primary goal of bancshares asset and liability management strategy 
liquidity is the ability to fund the needs of bancshares borrowers and depositors  pay operating expenses  and meet regulatory liquidity requirements 
maturing investments  loan and mortgage backed security principal repayments  deposit growth and borrowings from the federal home loan bank and other lenders are presently the main sources of bancshares liquidity 
bancshares primary uses of liquidity are to fund loans  operating expenses  deposit withdrawals  repay borrowings and to make investments 
as of december   liquid assets cash and due from banks  interest earning deposits with banks  and investment securities available for sale were approximately million  which represents of total assets and of total deposits and borrowings 
supplementing this liquidity  bancshares has lines of credit from correspondent banks of approximately million and an additional line of credit with the fhlb equal to of assets subject to available qualified collateral  with borrowings of million outstanding from the fhlb at december  
at december   outstanding commitments to extend credit were million and available line of credit balances totaled million 
management believes that the combined aggregate liquidity position of bancshares is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
certificates of deposit represented of bancshares total deposits at december  a slight decrease from at december  bancshares growth strategy will include efforts focused on increasing the relative volume of transaction deposit accounts 
certificates of deposit of  or more represented of bancshares total deposits at december  these deposits are generally considered rate sensitive  but management believes most of them are relationship oriented 
while bancshares will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at maturity  there are other subjective factors that will determine bancshares continued retention of those deposits 

table of contents banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the fdic and the federal reserve  the primary regulators of the bank and bancshares  respectively  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to its assets in accordance with these guidelines 
at december   bancshares maintained capital levels exceeding the minimum levels for adequately capitalized bank holding companies and banks 
capital ratios bancshares and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements 
as the following table indicates  at december   we exceeded our regulatory capital requirements 
at december  actual ratio minimum requirement well capitalized requirement american community bank total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio american community bancshares total risk based capital ratio na tier risk based capital ratio na leverage ratio na on july   the board of governors of the federal reserve issued a letter  sr  stating that trust preferred securities  such as those issued by american community capital trust i and american community capital trust ii  ltd  will continue to be included in tier capital until notice is given to the contrary 
accordingly  the above reflects those trust preferred securities 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes 
in the event of a disallowance  there would be a reduction in the company s consolidated capital ratios 
however  the company believes that the bank would still exceed the regulatory required minimums for capital adequacy purposes 
asset liability management bancshares asset liability management  or interest rate risk management  program is focused primarily on evaluating and managing the composition of its assets and liabilities in view of various interest rate scenarios 
factors beyond bancshares control  such as market interest rates and competition  may also have an impact on bancshares interest income and interest expense 
interest rate gap analysis 
as a part of its interest rate risk management policy  bancshares calculates an interest rate gap 
interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk  which measures the relative dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which reprice within a specific time period  either through maturity or rate adjustment 
the gap is the difference between the amounts of such assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within that period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing within the same period 
accordingly  in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a decrease in the yield on its assets greater than the decrease in the cost of its liabilities and its income should be negatively affected 
conversely  the cost of funds for an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to increase more slowly than the yield on its assets in a rising interest rate environment  and such institution s net interest income generally would be expected to be positively affected by rising interest rates 
changes in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on an institution with a negative gap 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
money market deposit accounts and negotiable order of withdrawal 
table of contents or other transaction accounts are assumed to pay out over a decay schedule 
in making the gap computations  standard assumptions regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the table reflects scheduled principal payments  which will be received throughout the lives of the loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of bancshares assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates bancshares discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires bancshares to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  bancshares evaluates its estimates which are based upon historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
bancshares significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
bancshares considers the following accounting policies to be most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for loan losses the most critical estimate concerns bancshares allowance for loan losses 
bancshares records provisions for loan losses based upon known problem loans and estimated deficiencies in the existing loan portfolio 
bancshares methodology for assessing the appropriations of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key components  which are a specific allowance for identified problem or impaired loans and a formula allowance for the remainder of the portfolio 
identified problem and impaired loans are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
the adequacy of the allowance is also reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of bancshares and other conditions  such as new loan products  collateral values  loan concentrations  changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
interest income recognition interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is generally not accrued on loans days or more past due unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
interest is not accrued on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are non accruing 
interest on non accruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arose from the purchase of first national bank of the carolinas 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill acquired will not be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with a comparison of book value and stock price 
if the initial evaluation suggests that an impairment of the asset value exists  the second step would determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if the tests conclude that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value would be adjusted  and an impairment loss would be recorded 
as of december  goodwill was not impaired 
the company reviews other identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table reflects the contractual obligations of the company outstanding as of december  payments due by period on demand or less than year years years after years total dollars in thousands borrowings securities sold under agreement to repurchase and federal funds sold capital lease obligation junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures operating leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations  excluding deposits deposits total contractual cash obligations  including deposits the million in borrowings that matures in the after years column above includes long term debt that has a call option whereby the lender the fhlb may call the debt in it has been the experience of bancshares that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits  thus not requiring any net cash outflow 
based on that assumption  management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations from normal operations 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements bancshares is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk including commitments to extend credit under existing lines of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit and interest rate risk are summarized as follows amount of commitment expiration per period dollars in thousands less than year years years after years total capital south partnership commitment standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit undisbursed lines of credit undisbursed portion of construction loans total off balance sheet commitments 
table of contents bancshares does not have any special purpose entities or other similar forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments to originate loans or to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
loan commitments generally expire within to days 
most equity line commitments are for a term of years  and commercial lines of credit are generally renewable on an annual basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
bancshares evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amounts of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by bancshares upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
related party transactions bancshares related party transactions for the same three year period have been limited to loans made to executive officers and directors in the ordinary course of business and the lease of certain buildings at prevailing market rates
