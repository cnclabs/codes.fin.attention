the pending sale of tommy hilfiger corp 
to apax partners could have an unknown effect on the positioning and strategy and may potentially affect our license which expires in march  although we intend to negotiate an extension of the licensing agreement beyond that time 
the company s international division  stride rite international corp 
sric  currently sells our brands in numerous countries around the world  predominantly through distributor and licensing arrangements 
in fiscal we will be integrating saucony s international business into sric 
this combination is expected to approximately double sric s revenues for fiscal the integration of saucony international and its subsidiaries in the united kingdom  netherlands and germany should enable sric to accelerate their european strategy by providing the infrastructure to compete in these key markets 
we expect that the tommy hilfiger footwear line will also continue to positively impact growth predominantly in central and south america 
for  the company expects to have the continued positive momentum of the stride rite children s retail stores and sperry top sider brands  in conjunction with the return to growth of the keds brand 
the acquisition of saucony gives us an authentic performance brand  which will be fully integrated during fiscal year the tommy hilfiger footwear business continues to be surrounded by uncertainty 
our international performance is expected to remain on the current upward trend and will be helped by the addition of saucony s international operations and the tommy hilfiger footwear line 
our expectations  which may be affected by future performance  are all subject to changes in fashion trends  economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties  which are more fully described elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
the most significant estimates included in these financial statements include valuation allowances and reserves for accounts receivable  inventory and income taxes 
these areas are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above 
actual results  therefore  could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers and royalty income 
wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  based on the shipping terms 
retail store revenues are recognized at the time of sale 
royalty income  which accounted for approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  is recognized when earned 
we permit merchandise returns from our customers under certain circumstances and engage in buy down programs with certain retailers  principally in the form of product markdown allowances for obsolete and slow moving products that are in the retailer s inventory 
allowances for markdowns and product returns are estimated and recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
the buy down programs are accounted for as a reduction in revenues 
the returns allowance is recorded as a reduction to revenues for the estimated sales value of the projected merchandise returns and as a reduction in cost of products for the corresponding cost amount 
our procedure for estimating product returns and markdown allowances is based upon our historical experience  product sell through performance by product and by customer  current and historical trends in the footwear 
table of contents industry and changes in demand for our products 
from time to time actual results will vary from the estimates that were previously established 
due to the existence of good monitoring systems  visibility into our customers inventory levels and ongoing communication with our customers  we believe we are able to identify and reflect in our financial statements in a timely manner variances from previously established estimates 
reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
these evaluations  which are performed by our centralized corporate credit department  include  but are not limited to  analyzing our customer s financial statements  maintaining a credit watch list to monitor accounts receivable exposure and reviewing the customer s prior payment history 
we predominantly sell our products to large retailers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to trade receivables 
however  there is a risk that some of these retail customers could experience financial difficulties  particularly in a weak economy  that may cause them to extend payment times or to default on their obligations to us 
if actual losses differ from estimated losses there will be an effect on net income and liquidity 
we believe we have sufficient financial resources and proper tools to mitigate the effect that a large default would have on our ability to continue to operate our business  however  if a large customer were to default on its financial obligation to us  we could experience a decrease in liquidity 
in addition to the impact on liquidity  we could also experience a decrease in future revenues and operating margins related to this loss of business 
inventory reserves the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times  leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence both at our own stores and within our wholesale inventories 
we are also exposed to the risk of inventory markdowns for excess or obsolete products  both at stride rite owned retail stores and from independent retailers 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine its fair market value and whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as part of selling and administrative expenses 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about their expected future operating performance 
the estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes in business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

table of contents defined benefit pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a cash flow matching approach for determining the appropriate discount rate for the defined benefit pension plan 
the citigroup pension discount curve was developed in response to the need for this type of cash flow matching 
the curve is derived from us treasury rates  plus an option adjusted spread varying by maturity  to derive hypothetical aa corporate bond rates 
as part of our valuation processes we produce cash flows expected benefit payments based on valuation assumptions for the next years 
specifically  for the defined benefit plan we projected years of future cash flows on a pbo basis projected pay but constant service  and then discount the cash flows using the citigroup pension discount curve 
we then solve for a single interest rate which results in the same present value of future cash flows as the value of cash flows produced by discounting each cash flow by the corresponding rate on the discount curve 
for fiscal year end  the result of this analysis indicates a single discount rate of next we use the same projected cash flows to determine the duration for the plan 
duration represents the approximate percentage change in plan liability for a change in the underlying discount rate 
the duration of a plan is a result of the timing of the cash flows and a higher duration means cash flows are farther out in the future with therefore a higher sensitivity to discount rate changes 
generally the shorter the duration  the lower the underlying discount rate should be 
at fiscal year end the cash flow analysis of the plan results in a duration of based on a discount rate of 
therefore a change in the discount rate will result in a change in pbo liability 
finally we compare the calculated duration for the plan to available benchmark indices to help select an interest rate 
if the calculated duration is similar to that of the chosen indices  it is reasonable to consider the index s discount rate in the rate setting process 
one such benchmark is the citigroup pension liability index which produces a single interest rate for a typical pension plan 
at year end the citigroup pension liability index reported a discount rate of based on a duration of 
our plan s calculated discount rate was based on duration of our pension plan s duration is slightly longer than the index  yet results in almost the same underlying discount rate 
therefore we do not need to consider using a lower discount rate for the plan 
under this model the pension plan supports a discount rate 
taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance has been assigned to our long term deferred tax assets since we believe it is more likely than not that we will not fully realize the benefits of such tax assets 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such a determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior 
table of contents estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to a future valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the period in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
the preparation of federal and state tax returns requires interpretations  judgments and estimates which are subject to the review and audit of taxing authorities 
we believe that the results of audits will not materially affect earnings 
contingencies the sale of tommy hilfiger branded footwear is a significant portion of our business 
the tommy hilfiger footwear sales are contingent on our licensing agreement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc during fiscal  we renewed the agreement for an additional term  which will expire in march whether our license with tommy hilfiger will remain in effect depends on our achieving certain minimum sales levels for the licensed products 
we expect to continue to meet the minimum sales levels required by the tommy hilfiger license agreement 
recently  the board of directors of tommy hilfiger corp  the parent company of tommy hilfiger licensing  inc  announced the pending sale of tommy hilfiger corp 
to apax partners 
if tommy hilfiger corp 
is sold there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our license agreement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc we believe that no provision is currently required for costs related to the potential loss of this license 
if we lose the tommy hilfiger license  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
revenues derived from our tommy hilfiger licenses were approximately million in fiscal and are included in the tommy hilfiger footwear segment  the other wholesale footwear segment specifically the stride rite international division  stride rite children s group retail division  and the stride rite children s group wholesale division 
hedge accounting for derivatives the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended in the first quarter of fiscal sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value 
the company evaluates its exposure to volatility in foreign currency rates and interest rates and may enter in derivative transactions  as it deems necessary 
the company did not enter into any derivative transactions in fiscal years and sfas requires companies to recognize adjustments to the fair value of derivatives that are not hedges currently in earnings when they occur 
for derivatives that qualify as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives can be recognized currently in earnings  along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis of the underlying hedged item  or can be deferred in other comprehensive income  depending on the exposure of the underlying transaction 
gains or losses on forward contracts which do not qualify for special hedge accounting are recorded in current earnings in other non operating income or expense 
gains and losses that qualify for special hedge accounting are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the statement of shareholders equity

the average first quality wholesale selling price remained substantially consistent with fiscal excluding saucony  first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal in addition  closeout sales decreased million  or from the comparable period in offsetting these decreases was a million  or increase in the sale of promotional products  a million increase in royalties and a million decrease in returns and allowances compared to the fiscal year 
the increase in royalty income was primarily the result of the champion footwear license 
the decrease in returns and allowances was a result of fewer product conversions and better product performance with our retailers 
this net decrease from wholesale net sales was offset by the strong stride rite children s group retail store sales comparisons to last year and the addition of saucony net sales in the fourth quarter which resulted in an overall increase of million in consolidated net sales

keds strategic decision to position their brand as a higher priced product in better channels resulted in a million increase in gross profit dollars as a result of the improvement in their quality of wholesale sales 
also contributing to the improved gross profit dollars was the additional gross profit related to the higher level of retail sales  combined with declines in returns and allowances and increased royalties 
offsetting a portion of these increases were the lower gross profit dollars caused by the declines in wholesale sales at tommy hilfiger and stride rite children s group wholesale  certain higher product costs and increased inventory obsolescence costs in the stride rite children s group wholesale segment and the stride rite international division 

table of contents operating costs selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of net sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was attributable in part to the addition of weeks of saucony expenses subsequent to the date of acquisition  which added million to the increase in selling and administrative expenses

stride rite children s group retail the net sales of the stride rite children s group retail company owned stores increased in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
sales at comparable children s group retail stores open for weeks in each fiscal year increased during fiscal driving this increase in the comparable stores category was the performance of baby stages products and other new product introductions in the children s shoe stores  as well as improved inventory selection in outlet stores

beginning in fiscal  the financial results of the saucony retail stores will be included in stride rite children s group retail 
current plans call for the closing of approximately underperforming saucony outlet stores in fiscal the stride rite children s group retail operating income increased due to a combination of both higher sales and an improved gross profit percentage versus the prior year 
offsetting the increased operating income were higher store operating expenses in fiscal  primarily related to the additional number of stores and certain increased indirect store costs 
stride rite children s group wholesale net sales decreased during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales of first quality products  mainly in the tommy hilfiger and munchkin product lines  as well as a decrease in closeout products sales 
offsetting a portion of these decreases were higher sales of both b rn kids and promotional products 
the stride rite children s group wholesale operating income declined slightly versus the prior year 
the decline was primarily related to the impact of the lower net sales and the corresponding reduction in gross profit dollars being largely offset by decreases in operating expenses 
tommy hilfiger footwear  inc the net sales of tommy hilfiger footwear men s and women s products decreased by during fiscal this was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in the men s business across all channels of distribution and a downward trend in both women s products and sales to department stores

the effect of this decision resulted in a million decrease in the comparison to the prior year s tommy hilfiger net sales

table of contents other wholesale footwear the increase in sales of the other wholesale footwear segment was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of the sperry top sider product line 
the sperry top sider increase was largely the result of strong sales of men s boat shoes and the overall women s product line 
the significant growth in the sperry top sider men s product sales in resulted from increases in the premium department store  family shoe store and outdoor channels 
the women s business had expanded retail distribution in the better department store  independent and outdoor channels  which resulted in increased sales of boat shoes  nautical casuals and canvas 
as planned  the keds sales decline versus last year was in the moderate and value retail sales channels and was primarily due to the strategic repositioning of the keds brand as a higher priced product line with improved styling  with less casual styles and an increased focus on basic core styles 
keds has two remaining retail stores  one which will be closing during fiscal and the other that will be converted to a stride rite store 
keds repositioned the brand in  returning to its historical position as a sneaker brand with an athletic heritage and targeting the younger consumer by utilizing the brand spokesperson  mischa barton 
the stride rite international division s net sales growth in fiscal also contributed to the increase in sales of the other wholesale footwear segment 
this was the result of strong sales of tommy hilfiger footwear in latin america  keds footwear in europe and asia  and sperry top sider in europe and south africa 
the increased operating income in the other wholesale footwear segment was primarily the result of higher sales of both sperry top sider and stride rite international and the increased gross profit percentages of both keds and sperry top sider 
keds higher gross profit was principally due to higher average selling prices combined with an improved returns and allowances performance 
offsetting a portion of the increased profits in were higher advertising spending in keds and sperry top sider

the average first quality wholesale selling price remained flat with fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal in addition  closeout sales decreased million from the comparable period in offsetting these decreases was a million increase in the sale of promotional products  a million increase in royalties and a million decrease in returns and allowances compared to the fiscal year 
the decrease in returns and allowances was a result of fewer product conversions and better product performance with our retailers 
this net decrease from wholesale net sales was offset by the strong retail store sales comparisons to last year which resulted in an overall increase of million in consolidated net sales 
the increase in royalty income was primarily the result of the champion footwear license 
gross profit in fiscal year  our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate of was flat to fiscal the significant factors contributing to the improved gross profit dollars were the additional gross margin related to the higher level of retail sales  which generally produce a higher gross profit margin than the company s wholesale brands  combined with declines in returns and allowances and increased royalties 
offsetting a portion of these increases were the lower gross margin dollars caused by the decline in wholesale sales  certain higher product costs and increased inventory obsolescence costs 
operating costs selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of net sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to company owned retail store expansion costs  including the addition of stores in and the additional expenses related to compliance with sarbanes oxley requirements 
somewhat offsetting these increased costs were lower bad debt and freight costs 
pension expense of million remained flat to fiscal during fiscal  advertising costs were of net sales versus in fiscal the decrease in advertising was primarily attributable to decreased contractual spending by tommy hilfiger  which is sales based 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal comparisons of investment income are negatively impacted by the receipt in fiscal year of million related to stride rite s sale of its interest in a joint venture footwear manufacturing facility as well as a gain on a prior year investment of million 
investment income related to the company s cash equivalents increased million in fiscal due to higher average interest rates 
interest expense  which is related to the revolving credit agreement s facility fee  remained flat in fiscal with fiscal  as there were no short term borrowings during either year 
other expense  net was higher in fiscal due to the performance of a company owned life insurance program as compared to the prior year 

table of contents in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal versus in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to less tax efficient investment vehicles 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
the increase in earnings in fiscal resulted from the higher net sales being affected by a flat gross profit percentage 
this was then somewhat offset by higher selling and administrative expenses and a higher effective income tax rate 
segments review stride rite children s group retail the overall increase in net sales of the stride rite children s group was primarily attributable to increased sales from children s group company owned retail stores  which were up from the comparable period last year 
sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year increased in fiscal both newer and older stores were responsible for the strong comparable store sales results 
at the end of fiscal  the stride rite children s group operated stores 
this is a net increase of stores  or from the end of fiscal in fiscal  ten children s shoe stores  five outlet stores  seven leased children s shoe departments and two shoe buzz stores were opened and five children s shoe stores were closed 
the stride rite children s group retail operating income increased due to higher sales and an improved gross profit percentage versus the prior year 
offsetting the increased profit were higher store operating costs in fiscal  primarily related to the additional stores and certain increased indirect store costs 
stride rite children s group wholesale in fiscal  sales to independent retailers remained flat when compared to last year 
during the fourth quarter of wholesale sales increased with the increase primarily attributable to increased sales of promotional and closeout products as well as fewer returns and allowances 
stride rite children s group s wholesale sales have increased over the comparable prior periods during the last three quarters of fiscal the stride rite children s group wholesale operating income decline versus the prior year was primarily related to the impact of the lower sales and lower profit margins  particularly on closeout product sales 
tommy hilfiger footwear  inc the decrease in the tommy hilfiger footwear men s and women s net sales can be attributed to declines in the men s athletic and casual businesses  a decrease in the sales of closeouts  as well as an increase in returns and allowances 
the department store channel continues to be challenging due to increased price pressure and the demand for lower priced merchandise 
the introduction of the tommy girl and h hilfiger product lines offset a portion of the sales declines in other components of the tommy hilfiger division 
the tommy hilfiger operating income decline versus prior year was primarily related to the effect of the lower sales in fiscal compared to operating expenses  although reduced in versus the prior year  could not fully offset the gross profit impact of the lower sales 
other wholesale footwear the increase in sales of the other wholesale footwear segment was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of the sperry top sider product line 
the major contributors to the increase in net sales of sperry top sider products were the strong sales of men s performance boat shoes and casual shoes as well as 
table of contents promotional items 
sales in the outdoor and department store channels also showed growth over closeout sales declined in fiscal as a result of the lower closeout inventory levels due to the strong performance of the overall first quality business 
sales declines in basic boat shoes and canvas casual products offset a portion of the net sales growth 
the decrease in the sales of keds branded products was primarily the result of weaknesses in the women s fashion styles and grasshoppers product lines  as well as decreased sales of closeouts and promotional products 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the children s product line and a decrease in returns and allowances 
keds closed one retail store in fiscal  with no new store openings  to bring the total keds retail store count to four 
in december  keds entered into an exclusive worldwide footwear license with the red hat society to manufacture and distribute women s footwear under the grasshoppers line 
the stride rite international division s net sales growth was the result of the addition of new distributors in asia and the middle east as well as continued strong sales of tommy hilfiger footwear in both asia and latin america 
overall  the keds product line sales decline offset a portion of the sperry top sider and stride rite international sales increases 
the other wholesale footwear segment s operating income increased due primarily to higher sales and gross profit from sperry top sider and stride rite international combined with lower operating expenses from keds 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our balance sheet reflected a current ratio of to with million in long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at the end of fiscal this decrease in our cash balance was primarily the result of the acquisition of saucony which was completed on september  during fiscal  our operations generated million of cash  more than the operating cash flows of million in fiscal but less than the million in fiscal our accounts receivable balance of million  increased million from the year earlier levels 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the addition of saucony s accounts receivable 
at december   our dso totaled days  an increase compared to the dso of days at year end but down from the dso of days at year end the increase in dso from last year is related to the addition of saucony which generally has offered somewhat longer credit terms to their customers 
partially offsetting this increase is the impact of more effectively pursuing past due receivables and reductions in customer chargebacks 
year end inventories totaled million  which was million or higher than the million at fiscal year end the inventory increase in fiscal related primarily to the addition of saucony  which includes saucony outlet stores  and the net addition of stride rite retail stores 
without the addition of saucony  inventory was only higher as compared to the prior year 
during fiscal year  our inventory turnover averaged times  lower than both the turnover rates of times during fiscal and times realized in fiscal the decrease in inventory turnover relates primarily to lower than anticipated sell in of current line merchandise in the spring season  coupled with the increase in retail stores which generally have a lower inventory turnover rate than our wholesale businesses 
additions to property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase in capital spending versus last year is primarily attributable to the renovation of existing retail locations  the renovation of our corporate headquarters and the higher number of store openings in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included million related to both new retail stores and the renovation of existing retail locations  million related to information technology expenditures and million related to the renovation of our corporate headquarters 
during fiscal we opened 
table of contents children s group retail stores 
in fiscal years and we opened and new retail stores  respectively 
during the fiscal year  our current plans call for the addition of approximately new retail stores 
in fiscal year  we are planning capital expenditures of approximately million 
the opening of new stores  renovation of existing stores and the continued implementation and modification of our retail merchandise planning system are the most significant areas of capital spending planned for fiscal in addition  our capital spending is planned to include improvements within our warehousing and distribution facilities as well as our headquarters location 
funding for our capital expenditures is expected to be provided by our operations and our revolving credit facility 
if business conditions are not favorable and do not allow for the funding of capital purchases from either our operations or through borrowings  our plans will be reevaluated 
our pension liabilities were increased slightly compared to fiscal these pension liabilities are developed from actuarial calculations and valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions  including discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets was developed by examining historical return rates based on the pension plan s asset allocation and considering such factors as return differentials for active investment management 
the expected rate of return remained constant in fiscal at 
due to the long term nature of this assumption  it is not expected that the rate of return percentage will vary yearly 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal year will also be 
the discount rate used for the calculation of plan liabilities at fiscal year end was  which is consistent with the rate used in fiscal we consider market conditions  including changes in interest and investment rates  in developing these assumptions 
at fiscal year end  our non cash minimum pension liability totaled million 
this liability was created by the shortfall of plan assets versus the accumulated benefit obligation 
pension expense  a non cash item  for fiscal was million and it is expected to increase in fiscal to approximately million 
during the fiscal year  we contributed million to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
there are no current plans in fiscal year to make any additional cash contributions to the pension plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during fiscal year we returned million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
this is down from the million returned to stockholders in the prior year as we spent million in fiscal to repurchase approximately million common shares under our share repurchase program 
over the three year period ended december   we repurchased a total of approximately million common shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   we have approximately million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors in june we believe that share repurchases are a good investment and an effective means of providing value to our stockholders 
we will continue to evaluate opportunistic share repurchases during the fiscal year 
we have paid a dividend to our stockholders each quarter since the company s initial listing on the new york stock exchange in we used million of cash for dividend payments during fiscal  which was an increase from the million used in fiscal and approximately equal to the million in fiscal on april   the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share of common stock 
funds for these share repurchases and dividends were provided from internal sources 
there are generally no restrictions on our ability to continue to pay our quarterly dividend  except that our revolving credit agreement  entered into on september   contains a debt covenant limiting restricted payments including dividend payments to no more than million annually unless the leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit agreement is below to we do not  however  believe that this restriction will impact our ability to continue to make dividend payments 
during the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including the market risk associated with interest rate movements on short term borrowings and cash equivalents 
additionally  economic conditions in countries where we source our products could negatively affect future inventory purchase commitments 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from outside the united states 
as these purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our saucony  inc subsidiary has historically used forward 
table of contents foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of their canadian and european foreign exchange risk relating to net sales 
we expect to continue that practice during the fiscal year 
we utilize cash from operations  short term investments and  if necessary  short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
in addition to internal sources of funding  we entered into a five year revolving credit facility on september  with nine banks 
the facility provides for secured revolving loans up to million  of which million is currently committed 
the facility also includes a million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans which fund short term working capital requirements 
in september  million was borrowed under the revolver to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition of saucony  inc and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the revolver and under the sub limit for swing line loans 
during the fourth quarter of  million was borrowed and subsequently repaid under the swing line  with no balance outstanding as of fiscal year end 
under the revolving credit facility  interest rates and facility fees are determined according to a pricing grid providing a margin rate over libor or an alternate base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the bank of america prime rate 
the applicable fees and margins are determined by the company s leverage ratio which is defined as consolidated total funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
at year end  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit line 
from october through september  we maintained a three year  revolving credit agreement with four banks providing for loans of up to million 
this revolving credit agreement was terminated on september  during fiscal and  we did not make any borrowings under the revolving credit agreement in place at that time 
refer to the form k that was filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission on september  for additional information on the revolving credit facility 
our significant financial obligations as of december  are as follows cash payments due during the fiscal years in thousands financial obligations thereafter total operating leases some of the operating leases have provisions for additional rentals based on increased property taxes and landlord operating costs and the leases for retail store space generally require additional rentals based on sales volume in excess of certain levels 
estimates for such amounts are not included in the table above as these have not been historically significant 
some leases have renewal options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial commitment periods  subject to terms agreed to at lease inceptions 
amounts committed under off balance sheet arrangements as of december  are as follows in thousands letters of credit forward foreign exchange contracts we use letters of credit to facilitate purchases of inventory with a significant number of our suppliers 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm and anticipated purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts are used by certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries as it relates to their purchase of saucony products 
the purpose of the contracts is to protect the subsidiaries cash flows from fluctuations in currency exchange rates as they relate to purchase and sale commitments 

table of contents we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the provisions of this statement are effective for a company s first reporting period following the company s fiscal year that begins on or after june  the company has evaluated the provisions of this revision and determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements will have a negative effect on consolidated net income 
the pre tax expense specifically related to sfas r is currently estimated at million for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in high grade securities with terms shorter than three months 
due to the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments 
we have available a million secured revolving line of credit  of which million is currently committed 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable spread or an alternate base rate 
at december   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
if interest rates were to change by basis points  it would change the annual interest expense on the year end borrowing amount by thousand 
we conduct operations in various international countries  which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries may be materially impacted by exposure to fluctuating exchange rates 
reported sales and costs and expenses at our foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on reported revenues and earnings  this impact is principally the result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
as the result of the saucony acquisition in september  we now enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in the ordinary course of business to hedge firm and anticipated intercompany purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
several of our foreign subsidiaries footwear inventory purchases are denominated in us dollars  which exposes them to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the purpose of our currency hedging is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign currency movements 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany payables 
the principal currencies we hedge are the canadian dollar  british pound sterling and euro 
the contracts have no cash requirements until maturity 
credit risk is minimal as the foreign 
table of contents exchange contracts are with major banking institutions 
the fair value of our forward exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in the currency exchange rates 
as of december   the national value of our forward exchange contracts was million 
we recorded a thousand gain as non operating other income in fiscal earnings 
the fair value of outstanding forward exchange contracts of thousand as of december  we have calculated the effect of a depreciation in the year end currency exchange rates related to the forward exchange contracts as of december  this depreciation would result in a loss on forward exchange contracts of approximately thousand at december  losses on our forward exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates will be partially offset by gains on the exposures being hedged 
the calculations of the hypothetical depreciation in the year end exchange rates assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate for another and do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency rates may have on the translation of the statement of income  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs
