item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly and annual operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by us and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our oem partners  which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or after the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog that can assist us in forecasting results 
for these reasons  as well as those described under risk factors  in item a above  our results of operations for any quarter or any year are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter or year 
a large portion of our quarterly professional product revenue usually is generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts 
as a result  operating results can be very negatively affected if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast or if  professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or year do not meet our forecast 
overview we develop and market computer software related to digital media that is  data  photographs  audio  and video in digital formats 
our product lines focus particularly on the two most successful current optical disc based digital media formats the compact audio disc cd audio and the dvd video disc dvd as well as the emerging high definition digital video disc hd dvd and blu ray disc bd formats 
our software is used to accomplish a variety of tasks  including creating digital audio and video titles in the cd audio  dvd  hd dvd and bd formats and in related formats  recording data files on cd  dvd and bd recordable discs in the cd rom  dvd rom and bd rom formats  editing video programs  playing dvd  hd dvd and bd discs  managing digital media on a computer s or consumer electronic device s file system  editing and adjusting digital photographs and other images  and backing up the information contained on hard disks attached to computers and consumer electronic devices 
most of the products we sell are software only products  though in our professional business we sometimes include computer hosted hardware with our software 
we also license the software technology underlying our tools to other companies to incorporate into products they develop 
most of the software we sell is intended for use in the windows and macintosh operating system environments  but some operate in linux environments or on proprietary platforms as well 
we organize our business into three operating units professional products group our professional products group offers professional level hardware and software authoring solutions for creating packaged media releases in dvd video  dvd rom as well as the newly released hd dvd and soon to be released bd next generation high definition and high density disc formats 
intended for use by highly skilled professional content creation customers  high end authoring houses  major motion picture studios and disc replicators  our products include scenarist workgroup  sd series and cinevision video and audio encoders  dvdit  dvdit pro  and edvd all of which we sell under the sonic brand name 
we also sell content development technology  products and services under the interactual brand name that enable professional dvd rom publishers to create advanced interactivity and seamless internet connectivity for dvd video titles 
additionally we license and or bundle some of our professiona l authoring products to third party companies such as avid technology 
our interactual enabled software dvd player is licensed to hollywood studios for inclusion on motion picture packaged media releases to consumers who view dvd video discs on pcs 
our professional products and services are offered to our customers through a worldwide sales force augmented with a specialized dealer network 
roxio division the roxio division offers a number of digital media software application products under the roxio brand name 
our consumer applications include backup mypc  cineplayer  easy dvd copy  mydvd  photosuite  popcorn  recordnow  roxio easy media creator  sonic digitalmedia studio  sonic primetime  toast  videowave and others 
we sell and market these products through product bundling arrangements with oem suppliers of related products  as well as volume licensing programs vlp  our webstore and in retail channels 
we finalized our acquisition of the roxio csd in december since the acquisition  we have been transitioning all of our consumer applications software products to the roxio brand 
advanced technology group the advanced technology group develops software and software components that it supplies to the other two operating units and that it licenses to pc application and consumer electronics developers 
we market much of this software under the authorscript  cineplayer  and roxio brand names 
the advanced technology group also collaborates with our corporate strategy group in the management of our patent program  under which we develop  acquire  license and sell patents 
it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between some of the business conducted by the roxio division and some of the business conducted by the advanced technology group 
thus  for purposes of reporting financial results by business segment we group the business of the roxio division together with that of the advanced technology group under the category of consumer software 
see note to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of financial data by business segment 
during fiscal year  we experienced continued growth in net revenue and net income 
net revenue grew from fiscal year to fiscal year revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales attributable to the product lines we acquired as part of the roxio csd and increased sales of our consumer products through new and existing oem licensing agreements 
additionally  sales of our professional products increased approximately 
international sales remained consistent at of net revenue for fiscal years and approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year resulted from sales to dell 
sales to our domestic and international distributors  ingram and navarre  accounted for and  respectively  of our revenues 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management must also make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  capitalized software  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue  which guidance necessitates the use of significant judgments by management in certain areas 
we recognize software related revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts we recognize revenue with respect to our patent program in accordance with the guidance of staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  hardware  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair v alues of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we follow eitf reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent 
generally  we record revenue at gross and record costs related to a sale in cost of revenue 
in those cases where we are not the primary obligor or merchant of record and or do not bear credit risk or earn a fixed transactional fee  we record revenue under the net method 
when we record revenues at net  revenue is reported at the net amount received by sonic 
we derive our software revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including any related hardware components  development agreements and maintenance and support 
we also sell and license patents and patented technology 
revenue recognized from multiple element software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements  for example  the license to use the software products versus maintenance and support for the software product 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us 
objective evidence of fair values of all elements of an arrangement may be based upon our historical pricing for those products and services when sold separately or  in the case of support services  annual renewal rates 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  but does exist for the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenue from license fees and patent sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists such as receipt of a signed agreement  purchase order or a royalty report  delivery of the product or other deliverable has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than one year from the time of delivery not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
revenue from development agreements in which the development is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  is recognized in accordance with sop over the performance period based on proportional performance 
under this method  management may be required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion as measured by hours completed to the total estimated hours to complete 
revenue from software product sales to distributors and retailers generally is recognized upon product shipment to the distributors or receipt of the products by the distributor  depending on the shipping terms  provided that all fees are fixed or determinable  evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is probable 
revenue from certain distributors is recognized upon sell through to retailers or end customers 
our distributor arrangements provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
additionally  we permit our distributors to return products in certain circumstances  generally during periods of product transition 
end users typically have the right to return their product within days of the purchase 
we establish allowances for expected product returns in accordance with statement financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and sab these allowances are recorded as a direct reduction of revenues and are netted from accounts receivable 
management applies significant judgment and relies on historical experience in establishing these allowances 
if future return patterns differ from past return patterns  due to reduced demand for our product or other factors beyond our control  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
sales made to distributors on a consignment basis are recognized upon sale to an end customer 
some of our authorscript license arrangements resemble software bundling arrangements in which we receive a royalty upon the shipment of every unit of the licensee s products containing the authorscript technology  whereas other authorscript arrangements involve extensive development and customization of our software in exchange for development fees and or one time license fees 
in those situations where the services to be performed in connection with the authorscript arrangement meet the requirements of sop  paragraph that is  we have vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the services  the services have an impact on the total price of the arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement  we recognize revenue as described above for multi element software arrangements  with revenue allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values o f elements 
in those situations where the services to be performed in connection with the authorscript arrangement are essential to the functionality of the ultimate software deliverables or the criteria of paragraph of sop cannot otherwise be met  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized over the performance period based on proportional performance 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to expense in the period the loss first becomes known 
to date  there have been no such losses 
in certain instances  a development agreement accounted for using the proportional performance method may include undelivered elements  such as maintenance and support  and vendor specific objective evidence may not exist for the undelivered elements 
if we cannot reliably estimate total profitability under the agreement but are reasonably assured that no loss will be realized on the agreement  we recognize revenue using the zero gross margin method 
under the zero gross margin method  revenue recognized under the contract equals costs incurred under the contract and any profit is deferred until development is complete 
we recognize the deferred gross profit over the remaining contractual service period eg the maintenance period 
in general  we recognize patent program revenue in accordance with sab the specific accounting treatment depends on the nature of the revenue producing transaction 
for example  in a licensing transaction where patents were licensed with software  we would recognize revenue in accordance with the principles governing multi element software arrangements 
during the quarter ended june   we sold certain patents for  and recognized revenue based upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement in the form of signed contracts  delivery assignment of the patents to the buyer  a fee that was fixed by the contracts and that was actually collected during the applicable quarter 
in connection with this transaction  we reported  as cost of goods sold   as a sales commission and approximately  as operating expenses 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which results from the following deferred license  maintenance and support  amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet sold to the end user customers  amounts billed in excess of services performed to customers for license and development agreements  and amounts billed to certain oems for products which contain one or more undelivered elements 
unbilled receivables in connection with the roxio csd acquisition we originally recorded approximately  as unbilled receivables which represent our estimate of the oem royalty reports we expect to receive after december  for shipments prior to december  as of march   we recorded an additional amount of approximately  as unbilled receivables  which represent our estimate of the remaining oem royalty reports we expect to receive after december  for shipments prior to december  allowance for returns and doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for returns and doubtful accounts to reflect the expected distributor returns and the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances may be required 
our distributor and retail arrangements provide for certain product rotation rights and permit product returns  particularly in the case of discontinued products 
end users typically have the right to return their product within days of purchase 
we maintain reserves for these estimated rights and returns 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  less the estimated cost of revenue  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future cost of revenue 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
acquisitions and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions typically result in a portion of the purchase consideration being allocated to goodwill and to identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
the amount allocated to each along with the estimated useful life affect the amount of current and future period charges for amortization expense 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  generally requires management to obtain advice from third party valuation firms and to make various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions rely  to a great extent  on the judgment of management based on information available at the time of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
rather  goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment  occurring at least annually 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined in sfas no 
sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
our organization is based on operating segments  which are comprised of our three reporting units  which sell various products to the principal markets in which our products are sold 
these three reporting units equate to our two op erating segments  as reported in note to our consolidated notes to financial statements  the consumer and professional products segments 
all three of the reporting units include goodwill 
in the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our operating units 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill has resulted from our ravisent product business acquisition during the quarter ended june   from our acquisition of veritas desktop and mobile division dmd from veritas during the quarter ended december   from our acquisition of interactual technologies  inc interactual during the quarter ended march   and from our roxio csd acquisition during the quarter ended december   all of which were accounted for as purchases 
as of march   no even ts have occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any goodwill impairment 
in the identifiable intangibles impairment analysis  if events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment adjustment equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
as of march   no events have occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any intangible asset impairment 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we do not have any long lived assets which we consider impaired as of march  stock based compensation we account for share based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our stock based compensation plans  including the illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the effective date of the proposed standard for public companies is for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
regarding measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
we have continued to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our financial statements  and we believe that the expensing of stock based compensation will have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 as amended 
for example  the impact of applying sfas no 
for fiscal year ended march  would have adjusted our diluted net income per share from to diluted net loss per share of 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on january  our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting on all unvested and outstanding stock options awarded to employees  officers  contractors and directors on or before january  under our various stock option plans with an exercise price greater than 
the effective date of the acceleration was january   and the closing price of our common stock on that date was per share 
as a result of this acceleration  we recorded a charge of approximately  in accordance in apb no 
 during the fourth quarter ended march  income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a provision for federal  state and foreign taxes  in the amount of   and  was made for the years ended march   and  respectively 
at march   we have a tax valuation allowance of  as compared with a valuation allowance of  at march  in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on our assessment of our operating trends and risks 
accordingly  based on management s evaluations  the majority of our tax asset valuation reserve balance of  was released  net of reclassifications of a portion of the reserves to equity  with the exception of reserves related to net operating losses obtained through a prior acquisition 
those acquired net operating losses have limitations in terms of utilization and accordingly  we have estimate d what portion of those amounts are more likely than not to be realizable 
other disclosures foreign subsidiaries during the quarter ended june  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in japan  called sonic japan kk 
through the roxio csd acquisition  we acquired a subsidiary of roxio in japan  which we combined with sonic s established subsidiary 
the combined subsidiary  named sonic solutions kabushiki kaisha kk  currently has a total of employees 
this subsidiary was established to handle the increased level of business we have encountered in japan  to potentially lower our overall tax rate  and to increase our level of direct contact with important japanese customers  particularly those oem customers utilizing our consumer software products 
during the quarter ended september   we established a wholly owned subsidiary in china  named sonic solutions shanghai china  and hired a number of engineers to work for this subsidiary 
we established this subsidiary in response to the growing demand for our technology worldwide 
this subsidiary allows us to tap into the large pool of engineering talent in china  speeding the development and deployment of our products and technologies to our customers 
the subsidiary also brings additional reach to our operations  which include development and sales offices in north america  europe  japan and taiwan 
in connection with the acquisition of the roxio csd  we also acquired additional wholly owned subsidiaries in canada and the united kingdom that provide engineering  technical support and sales and marketing services and three dormant subsidiaries in france  israel and the cayman islands 
the cayman islands subsidiary has since been liquidated 
us subsidiaries during the quarter ended march   we established a wholly owned us subsidiary in connection with our interactual acquisition 
this subsidiary includes all the acquired assets and liabilities of interactual  including its portfolio of patents and patent applications  the interactual player  and all engineering and service operations personnel 
during the quarter ended december   we established a wholly owned us subsidiary  sonic solutions international inc  for the purpose of holding investments in certain entities we may establish in the future 
other contingencies we are subject to various claims relating to products  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative acquired in process technology business integration total operating expenses operating income other income expense provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
net revenue increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  and increased to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of from fiscal year the increase in net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to increased sales from new and existing oem partners  and an increase of approximately from consumer software products 
the increase was also due to the addition of product lines acquired as part of the roxio csd acquisition  which we completed in mid december the increase in net revenue in fiscal year was primarily due to the addition of product lines acquired in the roxio csd acquisition  and to the increase in consumer product sales from new and existing oem partners 
consumer product sales increased approximately in fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year includes  in revenue recogn ized from the sale of patents acquired with the roxio csd acquisition  during the first quarter ended june  the increase in net revenue in fiscal year was also due to increased sales of our professional products of approximately 
the increase in professional products is primarily due to revenue recognized on sales of high definition dvd products of approximately  introduced during fiscal year the following table includes the breakdown of revenue by consumer and professional products for the fiscal years ended march    and in thousands years ended march  revenues consumer professional products total net revenue international sales accounted for million  or of our net revenue in fiscal year  million or of our net revenue in fiscal year  and million or of our net revenue in fiscal year the percentage decrease in fiscal year was due to the increase in domestic sales of oem  retail and development revenue from our consumer products as well as decline in sales of our professional products to our european customers 
the percentage in fiscal year was consistent with fiscal year sales to japan accounted for  and of our net revenue for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to european countries accounted for  and of our net revenue for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
international sales have historically ranged from to slightly less than of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant but v ariable percentage of future revenue 
the following table includes the breakdown of revenue for the fiscal years ended march    and indicated by geographic location in thousands years ended march  north america export france germany united kingdom other european japan singapore taiwan other pacific rim other international total net revenue cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists mainly of the costs of third party licensing fees for technologies incorporated into our products  employee salaries and benefits for personnel involved in post sales technical support of our products  the physical cost of the materials in our retail products and the costs associated with the amortization of acquired and internally developed software and intangible assets 
we also include  in cost of revenue  the cost of engineering services associated with percentage of completion type revenue contracts 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased from of net revenue in fiscal year to in fiscal year and increased to in fiscal year the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal years and was primarily due to the roxio csd software acquired in december  which has a higher percentage of retail sales 
retail sales carry a lower margin than our oem business 
the increase is also due to higher amortization expenses associated with the intangible assets acquired with the roxio csd acquisition 
additionally  in fiscal year  cost of revenue included  in costs related to the sale of patents obtained in the roxio csd acquisition  which were sold during the first quarter ended june  we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead  they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and then amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
during fiscal years and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  and amortized approximately  and  respectively  excluding amounts capitalized and amortized relating to the daikin industries  ltd  ravisent  dmd  interactual  and roxio csd business acquisitions 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately  and amortized approximately  relating to technol ogy and other intangible assets acquired pursuant to these acquisitions 
significant customers 
dell accounted for  and of our total net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
ingram and navarre accounted for and of our total net revenue  respectively  for fiscal years and  respectively 
revenue recognized from ingram and navarre was pursuant to distributor agreements assumed in the december acquisition of the roxio csd acquisition 
in september  dell made certain structural changes to its website that  based on initial reports  reduced the rate at which dell customers have purchased upgraded versions of our software 
as a result  we have worked cooperatively with dell to increase our upgrade rates and to compensate us for losses in revenues that we might otherwise experience as a result of internal dell website changes 
while we believe that we have successfully negotiated appropriate terms with dell to address these factors  there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully insulate ourselves from dell corporate website or other decisions that could affect adversely sales of our consumer products to dell customers 
the loss of any one of these customers and our inability to obtain new customers to replace the lost revenue in a timely manner would harm our sales and results of operations 
the following table shows the percentage breakdown of significant customers for the periods indicated percent of total revenue percent of total accounts receivable years ended march  march  dell hewlett packard sony ingram navarre gross profit 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year  and further decreased to for fiscal year the decrease in our gross profit was primarily due to the increase in cost of sales associated with the product lines acquired as part of the roxio csd acquisition  which are distributed to a large extent through retail channels and which generally exhibit a lower gross margin than our historical consumer software sales 
the decrease is also due to the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangibles acquired as part of the roxio csd acquisition 
following the roxio csd acquisition  we derive a greater portion of our revenue from sales of software to end users via retail channels both retail store and web based 
retail sales often require physical fulfillment of customer orders involving shipment of boxes  cds or dvds and or manuals resulting in higher direct costs than our historical business 
in addition  retail channels are often quite competitive  sometimes requiring price reductions to maintain market share 
the combination of higher costs and possibly lower prices results in lower gross margins for retail sales than we have been accustomed to in our historical oem business 
you should not rely on our past margins as an indication of future results 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and benefits  travel  marketing and other promotional expenses  facilities expense and dealer and employee sales commissions 
our marketing and sales expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  and increased further to  in fiscal year marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales expenses increased in fiscal years and primarily due to an increase in salary expenses relating to the overall increase in headcount  an increase in our promotional and advertising expenses as a result of our increased marketing and sales operations and an increase in those promotional expenses associated with the sales of the retail products acquired with the roxio csd acquisition 
in fiscal year  o ur advertising expenses total approximately  primarily related to the roxio csd products 
upon the completion of the roxio csd acquisition in december  roxio marketing and sales employees joined sonic 
higher sales commissions associated with the overall increase in revenue and with the sale of certain patents acquired in the roxio csd acquisition also contributed to the higher marketing and sales expense 
marketing and sales headcount increased from at march  to at march  and decreased slightly to at march  we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will continue to increase as our global marketing and sales operations continue to expand and headcount continues to increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and benefits  facilities  travel and consulting expenses incurred in the development of new products 
our research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  and increased further to  in fiscal year research and development expenses represented  and of net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher salary expense  increased facility expense and increased consulting expense as a result of our expanded product lines and development of products 
in december  roxio research and development employees joined the company through the roxio csd acquisition 
headcount increased from at march  to at march  to at march  we anticipate that research and development expenditures will continue to increase in future periods as our operations expand 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and benefits  travel  overhead  corporate facilities expense  legal  accounting and other professional services expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year and to  in fiscal year general and administrative expenses represented  and of net revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal years  and primarily due to increased rent  insurance  professional and other general expenses related to the overall increase in our headcount from at march  to at march  to at march  the increase in fiscal years and was also due to the increased expenses associated with the implementation of the requirements of se ction of the sarbanes oxley act 
during fiscal years and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively  in professional services expenses associated with these requirements 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue increase in the future as our operations expand 
acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology expense of  for fiscal year included the write off of in process research and development acquired in connection with the roxio csd acquisition 
we identified research projects ongoing at the time of the roxio csd acquisition for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future use existed 
the value for each of the projects was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and the applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
business integration expense 
business integration expenses related primarily to costs incurred during the integration of the roxio csd business into our existing operations 
these expenses included incremental costs consisting primarily of employee severance and lease exit costs totaling approximately  a portion of internal payroll costs for those employees who worked on the acquisition totaling approximately  and incremental costs incurred by consultants who worked on the acquisition and integration totaling approximately  other income and expense  net 
other income on our consolidated statements of operations included the interest we earned on cash balances and short term investments and realized foreign currency fluctuations 
interest income was approximately   and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest income increased in the periods presented as a result of our increased cash balances invested and rising interest rates 
other expense for fiscal years and primarily consisted of interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  relating to the interest due on the union bank of california na amended credit facility described under liquidity and capital resources below 
other expense in fiscal years and also included write downs of investments in other entities  which totaled approximately  and  respectively 
other income and expen se for fiscal years  and also included foreign currency transaction gains and losses

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments 
additionally  eitf includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf  however  the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june  we will evaluate the impact of eitf once final guidance is issued 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins  chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment and on march   the sec issued sab  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
the effective date of the standard for public companies is for the first annual reporting period beginning after june  as a result  we adopted sfas no 
r as of april  while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
regarding measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to rec ognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
we have continued to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our financial statements  and on january  our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting on all unvested and outstanding stock options awarded to employees  officers  contractors and directors on or before january  under our various stock option plans with an exercise price greater than 
the effective date of the acceleration was january   and the closing price of our common stock on that date was per share 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
 which requires nonmonetary exchanges to be recorded at the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions 
this standard requires most exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at their fair value rather than at their carryover basis 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt this standard in fiscal year management believes that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements

we do not currently anticipate repatriating monies held at our foreign subsidiaries 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition in a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  this standard does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we will determine the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements when an accounting change or error correction occurs
