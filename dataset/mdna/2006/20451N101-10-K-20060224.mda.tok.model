chemical customers accounted for approximately of our gross sales of salt 
principal customers are producers of intermediate chemical products used in pulp bleaching  water treatment and a variety of other industrial uses 
our customers do not have a captive source of brine 
distribution into the chemical market is made primarily through multi year supply agreements  which are negotiated privately 
price  service  product quality and security of supply are the major competitive market factors

in north america  other large  nationally recognized companies compete against our highway deicing and chemical salt products 
in addition  there are several smaller regional producers of highway deicing salt 
there are several importers of salt into north america but these mostly impact the eastern seaboard where we have a minimal position 
in the united kingdom  there are two other companies that produce highway deicing salt  one in northern england and the other in northern ireland 
there are no significant imports of highway deicing salt into the united kingdom 
general trade salt products products and sales the general trade business accounted for approximately of our gross sales of salt 
we are the third largest producer of general trade salt in north america 
this product line includes commercial and consumer applications  such as table salt  water conditioning  consumer ice control  food

form k processing  agricultural applications  as well as a variety of industrial applications 
we believe that we are the largest private label producer of water conditioning and salt based agricultural products in north america and sell more than private labels of table salt to major retailers 
our sifto brand is well recognized in the canadian market 
on december   we sold our weston point  england evaporated salt plant and related general trade business to ineos enterprises limited  a brine supplier to and largest customer of that plant 
gross sales from this business totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we have maintained a significant presence in the general trade business over recent years due to our strong focus on i the midwestern region of the united states  ii all of canada  iii our distribution network to the grocery trade  and iv our relationships with large distributors of water conditioning salt 
the general trade market is driven by strong customer relationships 
sales in the general trade salt product line occur through retail channels  such as grocery stores  building supply  hardware  mass merchants and feed suppliers 
distribution in the general trade salt product line is channeled through a direct sales force located in various parts of our service territories who sell products to distributors  dealers and end users 
we also maintain a network of brokers who sell table salt  consumer deicing and water conditioning products 
these brokers service wholesalers  grocery chains and retailers  as well as the food service industry

specialty potash segment sop is primarily used as a specialty fertilizer  providing essential potassium to high value  chloride sensitive crops  such as vegetables  fruits  tea  potatoes  grapes  nuts  tobacco and turf grass 
we are the market leader in north america for sop and market sop products both domestically and overseas 
we offer several grades of sop  which are designed to better serve the special needs of our customers 
our sulfate of potash plant is the largest in north america and one of only two all natural solar sop plants in the western hemisphere 
in  the specialty potash segment accounted for approximately of our gross sales 
potash industry overview the annual worldwide consumption of all potash fertilizers approaches million tons 
muriate of potash  or potassium chloride  is the most common source of potassium and accounts for approximately of all potash consumed in fertilizer production 
sop represents approximately of potash consumption 
the remainder is supplied in the forms of potassium magnesium sulfate  nitrate of potassium and  to a lesser extent  potassium thiosulfate and monopotassium phosphate 
all of these products contain varying concentrations of potassium expressed as potassium oxide ko and different combinations of co nutrients 
muriate of potash is the least expensive form of potash fertilizer based on the concentration of ko and consequently  it is the most widely used potassium source for most crops 
however  sop containing approximately ko is utilized by growers for many high value crops  especially where there are requirements for fertilizers with low chloride content 
the use of sop has been scientifically proven to improve the yield and quality of certain crops 
examples of crops where sop is utilized to increase yield and quality include tobacco  tea  potatoes  citrus fruits  grapes  almonds  some vegetables and on turfgrass  including turf for golf courses 
approximately of our annual sop sales volumes in were made to domestic customers  which include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of professional turf care products 
these dealers and distributors combine or blend sop with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements 
operations and facilities all of our sop production is located on the great salt lake west of ogden  utah 
it is the largest sop production facility in north america 
the evaporation facility utilizes solar energy and operates over  acres of evaporation ponds to produce sop and magnesium chloride from the brine of the great salt lake 
the property utilized in our operation is both owned and leased under annually renewing leases 
this facility currently has the capacity to annually produce approximately  tons of sop  approximately  tons of magnesium chloride and over million tons of salt 
by mid year  we expect to complete our project to expand our capacity to produce liquid magnesium chloride by approximately and double our capacity to produce crystallized magnesium chloride 
these recoverable minerals exist in vast quantities in the great salt lake 
we estimate the recoverable minerals exceed years of reserves at current production rates and capacities and are so vast that quantities will not be significantly impacted by our additional production 
our rights to extract these minerals are contractually limited although we believe we will continue to be able to extend our lease agreements  as we have in the past  at commercially reasonable terms  without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions  thereby allowing us to continue extracting minerals and significantly extend the future recognized economic life of the reserves 
the potassium bearing salts are mechanically harvested and refined to high purity sop in our production facility that has been in operation since we believe that our property and operating equipment are maintained in good working condition 
products and sales our domestic sales of sop are concentrated in the western and southeastern portions of the united states where the crops and soil conditions favor sop 
we generally export sop through major trading companies 
international sop sales volumes in were of our annual sop sales 
beginning in late  we organized and employed an experienced global sales group to focus on the specialty aspects and benefits of sop as a source of potassium nutrients 
we believe our sales growth over the past few years has been positively influenced by reestablishing this specialty marketing focus

with respect to each facility at which we extract salt  brine or sop  we obtain any required or necessary permits prior to the commencement of mining 
permits or licenses are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on our mine plans and state  provincial and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing 
based on our historical permitting experience  we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits to support historical rates of production 
our mineral leases have varying terms 
some will expire after a set term of years  while others continue indefinitely 
many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of mineral extracted or as a percentage of revenue 
we believe we will be able to continue to extend our material mineral lease agreements  as we have in the past  at commercially reasonable terms  without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions 
in addition  we own a number of properties and are party to non mining leases that permit us to perform activities that are ancillary to our mining operations  such as surface use leases  and storage  depot and warehouse leases 
we believe that all of our leases were entered into at market terms

form k the following map shows the locations of our principal salt and sop production facilities map environmental  health and safety matters we produce and distribute crop and animal nutrients  salt and deicing products 
these activities subject us to an evolving set of international  federal  state  provincial and local environmental  health and safety ehs laws that regulate  or propose to regulate i product content  ii use of products by both us and our customers  iii conduct of mining and production operations  including safety procedures followed by employees  iv management and handling of raw materials  v air and water quality impacts from our facilities  vi disposal  storage and management of hazardous and solid wastes  vii remediation of contamination at our facilities and third party sites  and viii post mining land reclamation 
for new regulatory programs  it is difficult for us to ascertain future compliance obligations or estimate future costs until implementation of the regulations have been finalized and definitive regulatory interpretations have been adopted 
we respond to regulatory requirements by implementing necessary modifications to our facilities and or operating procedures 
we have expended  and anticipate that we will continue to expend  substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with ehs standards 
we estimate that our ehs capital expenditures will total approximately million  primarily related to air quality devices and highway deicing salt storage pads 
we expect that our estimated expenditures in for reclamation activities will be approximately million 
it is possible that greater than anticipated ehs capital expenditures or reclamation expenditures will be required in or in the future 
we maintain accounting accruals for certain contingent environmental liabilities and believe these accruals comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we record accruals for environmental investigatory and non capital remediation costs when litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted or is imminent  the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the financial impact of such outcome is reasonably estimable 
based on current information  it is the opinion of management that our contingent liabilities arising from ehs matters  taking into account established accruals  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   we had recorded environmental accruals of million 
product requirements and impacts international  federal  state and provincial standards i require registration of many of our products before such products can be sold  ii impose labeling requirements on those products  and iii require producers to manufacture the products to formulations set forth on the labels

the us environmental protection agency  or the epa  the state of california and the fertilizer institute have each completed independent assessments of potential risks posed by crop nutrient materials 
these assessments concluded that  based on the available data  crop nutrient materials generally do not pose harm to human health 
it is unclear whether any further evaluations may result in additional standards or regulatory requirements for the producing industries  including us  or for our customers 
at this stage  it is the opinion of management that the potential impact of these standards on the market for our products or on the expenditures that may be necessary to meet new requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the canadian government released a priority substances list assessment report for road salt 
this report found that road salts are entering the environment under conditions that may have a harmful effect or constitute a danger to the environment 
based on this report  the minister of environment has proposed designating road salt as a toxic substance pursuant to the canadian environmental protection act 
canada s federal cabinet  which has ultimate responsibility  has not yet taken final action with respect to this proposal and is not subject to any deadline to do so 
this proposal was subject to a public comment  during which individuals and the municipalities which comprise most of our customers expressed a variety of views  including noting the utility and cost efficiency of salt as compared to other potential measures to reduce ice related road hazards 
at this point  environment canada has indicated that  whether or not road salts are declared toxic  their preferred course of action is the establishment of voluntary guidelines for users as opposed to any form of regulation 
environment canada has been developing these guidelines based on consultation with a broad based stakeholders group  which includes the salt industry 
on april   environment canada published a code of practice to serve as these guidelines 
the code of practice requires large road salt users to develop salt management plans 
we do not believe that this will have a material direct effect on us  but the new salt management plans may lead our customers in canada to require less road salt 
given the importance of road salt for traffic safety and the current lack of any practical substitute  we deem it unlikely that any guidelines or regulations would result in a complete ban on the use of road salt 
as noted in the december report  the use of road salt and other deicing agents is an important component of strategies to keep roadways open and safe during the winter and minimize traffic crashes  injuries and mortality under icy and snowy conditions 
the report further stated that mitigation measures must be based on optimization of winter road maintenance practices so as not to jeopardize road safety  while minimizing the potential for harm to the environment 
environment canada has confirmed the high importance of road safety in its proposed regulation of road salt 
in its september  press release in connection with the proposed code of practice  it indicated that the proposed code will provide those who use road salts with a way to reduce harm to the environment without jeopardizing road safety 
since the dissemination of the december report  we have endeavored to work more closely with the national government as well as provinces and municipalities to better manage the use  storage and release of our road salts 
as a result  we believe it has become less likely that road salts will be designated as a toxic substance 
we cannot predict whether the proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance will be finalized or the promulgation of any other future regulation 
standardized guidelines for the use and storage of road salt or any alternate deicing products may cause us to suffer reduced sales and incur substantial costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  while we are not aware of any similar governmental proposals for such designation of road salt in either the united states or the united kingdom  we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not arise 
operating requirements and impacts we hold numerous environmental  mining and other permits or approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities 
our operations are subject to permits for extraction of salt and brine  discharges of process materials to air and surface water  and injection of brine and wastewater to subsurface wells 
some of our proposed activities may require waste storage permits 
a decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval  or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 
in addition  changes to environmental and mining regulations or permit requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 
expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 
pursuant to the mine safety and health act  new interim regulatory standards for diesel particulate matter became effective in and final standards are expected to become effective in in response to litigation regarding its final rule on diesel particulate matter  the mine safety and health administration has initiated a new rule regarding certain provisions of the final standards 
we are currently in compliance with the interim standards that are in effect between and however  material expenditures may be required to achieve compliance with the final standards at the cote blanche facility in louisiana 
remedial activities remediation at our facilities many of our formerly owned and current facilities have been in operation for a number of years 
operations have historically involved the use and handling of regulated chemical substances  salt and by products or process tailings by us and predecessor operators which have resulted in soil  surface water and groundwater contamination 
at many of these facilities  spills or other releases of regulated substances have occurred previously and potentially could occur in the future  possibly requiring us to undertake or fund cleanup efforts under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  or state and provincial or united kingdom laws governing cleanup or disposal of hazardous substances 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies  to undertake investigations  which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k identified site conditions 
at still other locations  we have undertaken voluntary remediation  and have removed formerly used underground storage tanks 
taking into account established reserves  expenditures for these known conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material 
however  material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites 
in addition  in connection with the recapitalization  mosaic has agreed to indemnify us against liabilities for certain known and unknown conditions at existing and former sites 
the wisconsin department of agriculture  trade and consumer protection datcp reportedly has information indicating that agricultural chemicals are present in the groundwater in the vicinity of the kenosha  wisconsin plant 
datcp has directed us to conduct an investigation into the possible presence of agricultural chemicals in soil and groundwater at the kenosha plant 
we have developed a plan which has been approved by datcp to investigate soils and groundwater at the kenosha site 
depending on the results of the investigation  remedial efforts may be necessary 
although little is currently known about the possible source of such contamination  or who should be responsible for it  we expect datcp will look to us to undertake those efforts 
if required  we intend to conduct all phases of the investigation and any required remediation work under the wisconsin agricultural chemical cleanup program  which will provide for reimbursement of some of the costs 
none of the identified contaminants have been used in association with compass minerals site operations 
we expect to seek participation by  or cost reimbursement from  other parties responsible for the presence of any agricultural chemicals found in soils at this site 
remediation at third party facilities along with impacting the sites at which we have operated  various third parties have alleged that our historic operations have resulted in contamination to neighboring off site areas or nearby third party facilities 
cercla imposes liability  without regard to fault or to the legality of a party s conduct  on certain categories of persons who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
under cercla  or its various state analogues  one party may potentially be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties 
we have entered into de minimis settlement agreements with the epa with respect to several cercla sites  pursuant to which we have made one time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites 
in some cases  however  such settlements have included reopeners  which could result in additional liability at such sites in the event of newly discovered contamination or other circumstances 
at other sites for which we have received notice of potential cercla liability  we have provided information to the epa that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable  and the epa has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to orders from or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies or agreements with private parties  to undertake or fund investigations  some of which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action  under cercla or otherwise  may be required to address contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform required remedial activities that will address identified site conditions 
at the present time  we are not aware of any additional sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the epa or any other party of potential cercla liability 
however  based on past operations  there is a potential that we may receive notices in the future for sites of which we are currently unaware or that our liability at currently known sites may increase 
taking into account established accruals  expenditures for our known environmental liabilities and site conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material or have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the information set forth in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business the seasonal demand for our products and the variations in our operations from quarter to quarter due to weather conditions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock 
our highway deicing product line is seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter as a result of weather conditions and other factors 
on average  over the last five years  our north american highway deicing product line has generated over of its annual sales  net of shipping and handling costs  during the months of december through march when the need for highway deicing is at its peak 
we need to stockpile sufficient highway deicing salt in the last three fiscal quarters to meet estimated demand for the winter season 
weather conditions that impact our highway deicing product line include temperature  levels of precipitation  number of snow days and duration and timing of snow fall in our relevant geographic markets 
lower than expected sales by us during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock 
our sop operating results are dependent in part upon conditions in the agriculture markets 
the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors  the most important of which  for us markets  are weather patterns and field conditions particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption and quantities of crop nutrients imported to and exported from north america 
additionally  our ability to produce sop at our solar evaporation ponds is dependent upon arid weather conditions 
extended periods of precipitation or a prolonged lack of sunshine would hinder our production levels resulting in lower sales volumes

form k our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  including approximately million under cmg s senior secured term loan facility  million under the cmg senior secured revolving credit facility  million of cmg senior subordinated notes  million of our senior discount notes  million of our senior subordinated discount notes  and a stockholders deficit of million 
this level of leverage could have important consequences  including the following it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy  it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  and it may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  as needed 
although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries  none of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our indebtedness or to pay dividends on our capital stock 
accordingly  our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and distribute dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries 
the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit the transferability of assets and the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries can distribute to us 
the terms of our senior credit facilities also restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends to us in order to fund cash interest payments on the senior discount notes and the senior subordinated discount notes if cmg does not comply with the provisions relating to the adjusted total leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under our senior secured credit facilities 
we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance with these ratios 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  when due 
if we consummate an acquisition  our debt service requirements could increase 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own and depend on our subsidiaries for cash 
although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries  none of our subsidiaries are obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our indebtedness or to pay dividends on our capital stock 
accordingly  our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and distribute dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries 
the terms of the cmg senior secured credit facilities including the term loan and revolving credit facility include limitations on the amount of dividends and equity distributions our subsidiaries can pay to us  as discussed above 
all of our subsidiaries are guarantors of the cmg senior secured credit facilities 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness when due 
increasing interest rates would have an adverse affect on our interest expense under our senior secured credit facilities 
additionally  the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of compass minerals group may limit our ability to pursue our business strategies or may require accelerated payments on our debt 
we pay variable interest on our senior secured credit facilities based on libor or abr 
as of december   approximately million of our variable rate borrowings totaling million has been hedged through an interest rate swap agreement 
consequently  increases in interest rates will adversely affect our cost of debt for the portion that has not been hedged 
our senior secured credit facilities and indebtedness limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations  pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  repurchase or redeem our stock  make investments  grant liens  make capital expenditures  sell assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies 
in addition  our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain financial ratios 
these financial ratios include an interest coverage ratio and a total leverage ratio 
although we have historically been able to maintain these financial ratios  we may not be able to maintain these ratios in the future 
covenants in our senior secured credit facilities may also impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures or engage in other favorable business activities 
if we default under our senior secured credit facilities  the lenders could require immediate payment of the entire principal amount 
these circumstances include nonpayment of principal  interest  fees or other amounts when due  a change of control  
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k default under agreements governing our other indebtedness  material judgments in excess of  or inaccuracy of representations and warranties 
any default under our senior secured credit facilities or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of principal payments under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities require immediate repayment  we will not be able to repay them and also repay our other indebtedness in full 
our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business  including economic loss and a negative impact on earnings 
since we manufacture and sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales outside the united states  as a percentage of our total sales  were for the year ended december  accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  exchange controls  tariffs  other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  differing labor regulations  requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries  make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may adversely affect our results of operations 
because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars  if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies  the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings 
in addition  our debt service requirements are primarily in us dollars even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in canadian dollars and pounds sterling 
significant changes in the value of canadian dollars and pounds sterling relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on us dollar denominated debt 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
given the volatility of exchange rates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and or translation risks 
it is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced and expect to experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings from time to time as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effects of currency fluctuations and inflation and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
our overall success as a global business depends  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing economic and political conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business 
our operations are dependent on natural gas and a significant interruption in the supply or increase in the price of natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
energy costs  including primarily natural gas and electricity  represented approximately of our total production costs in natural gas is a primary fuel source used in the evaporated salt production process 
our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties 
we have a policy of hedging natural gas prices through the use of swap agreements 
we have not entered into any long term contracts for the purchase of natural gas 
our contractual arrangements for the supply of natural gas do not specify quantities and are automatically renewed annually unless either party elects not to do so 
we do not have arrangements in place with back up suppliers 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through our hedging arrangements  or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas to our production facilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
increasing costs or a lack of availability of transportation services could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products at competitive prices 
because of salt s relatively low production cost  transportation and handling costs tend to be a significant component of the total delivered cost of sales 
the high relative cost of transportation tends to favor manufacturers located close to the customer 
we contract shipping  barge  trucking and rail services to move salt from our production facilities to the distribution outlets and customers 
a reduction in the availability of transportation services or a significant increase in transportation service rates could impair our ability to economically deliver salt to our markets 
competition in our markets could limit our ability to attract and retain customers  force us to continuously make capital investments and put pressure on the prices we can charge for our products 
we encounter competition in all areas of our business 
competition in our product lines is based on a number of 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k considerations  including product performance  transportation costs in salt distribution  brand reputation  quality of client service and support  and price 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency 
our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
environmental laws and regulation may subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs in the future 
we are subject to numerous environmental  health and safety laws and regulations in the united states  canada and europe  including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation and remediation of hazardous substance releases  and discharges to air and water 
for example cercla imposes liability  without regard to fault or to the legality of a party s conduct  on certain categories of persons known as potentially responsible parties prps who are considered to have contributed to the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
although we are not currently incurring material liabilities pursuant to cercla  we may in the future incur material liabilities under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws  with regard to our current or former facilities  adjacent or nearby third party facilities  or off site disposal locations 
under cercla  or its various state analogues  one party may  under some circumstances  be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties 
liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws are subject to civil  and in some cases  criminal sanctions 
we have received notices from governmental agencies that we may be a prp at certain sites under cercla or other environmental cleanup laws 
we have entered into de minimis settlement agreements with the united states with respect to certain cercla sites  pursuant to which we have made one time cash payments and received statutory protection from future claims arising from those sites 
at other sites for which we have received notice of potential cercla liability  we have provided information to the epa that we believe demonstrates that we are not liable and the epa has not asserted claims against us with respect to such sites 
in some instances  we have agreed  pursuant to consent orders or agreements with the appropriate governmental agencies  to undertake investigations which currently are in progress  to determine whether remedial action may be required to address such contamination 
at other locations  we have entered into consent orders or agreements with appropriate governmental agencies to perform remedial activities that will address identified site conditions 
at the present time  we are not aware of any additional sites for which we expect to receive a notice from the epa of potential cercla liability 
however  based on past operations there is a potential that we may receive such notices in the future for sites of which we are currently unaware 
taking into account established reserves  expenditures for our known environmental liabilities and site conditions currently are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to be material 
however  material expenditures could be required in the future to remediate the contamination at these or at other current or former sites 
we have also developed alternative mine uses 
for example  we entered into a joint venture with a subsidiary of veolia environnement  a business with operations in the waste management industry 
the joint venture is permitted by the jurisdictional environmental agency to dispose of certain stable types of hazardous waste in our salt mine in the united kingdom 
we believe that the mine is stable and provides a secure disposal location 
however  we recognize that any temporary or permanent storage of hazardous waste may involve risks to the environment 
although we believe that we have taken these risks into account as much as possible in our planning process  it is possible that material expenditures could be required in the future to further reduce this risk  or to remediate any future contamination 
continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at ongoing operations  which will be charged against income from future operations 
present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations may require substantial capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the canadian government s proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance could have a material adverse effect on our business  including reduced sales and the incurrence of substantial costs and expenditures 
in december  the canadian government released a priority substances list assessment report for road salt 
this report found that road salts are entering the environment under conditions that may have a harmful effect or constitute a danger to the environment 
based on this report  the minister of environment has proposed designating road salt as a toxic substance pursuant to the canadian environmental protection act 
canada s federal cabinet  which has ultimate responsibility  has not yet taken final action with respect to this proposal and is not subject to any deadline to do so 
this proposal was subject to a public comment  during which individuals and the municipalities which comprise most of our customers expressed a variety of views  including noting the utility and cost efficiency of salt as compared to other potential measures to reduce ice related road hazards 
at this point  environment canada has indicated that  whether or not road salts are declared toxic  their preferred course of action is the establishment of voluntary guidelines for users as opposed to any form of regulation 
environment canada has been developing these guidelines based on consultation with a broad based stakeholders group  which includes the salt industry 
on april   environment canada published a code of practice to serve as these guidelines 
the code of practice requires large road salt users to develop salt management plans 
we do not believe that this will have a material direct effect on us  but the new salt management plans may lead our customers in canada to require less road salt 

table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k given the importance of road salt for traffic safety and the current lack of any practical substitute  we deem it unlikely that any guidelines or regulations would result in a complete ban on the use of road salt 
as noted in the december report  the use of road salt and other deicing agents is an important component of strategies to keep roadways open and safe during the winter and minimize traffic crashes  injuries and mortality under icy and snowy conditions 
the report further stated that mitigation measures must be based on optimization of winter road maintenance practices so as not to jeopardize road safety  while minimizing the potential for harm to the environment 
environment canada recently confirmed the high importance of road safety in its proposed regulation of road salt 
in its september  press release in connection with the proposed code of practice  it indicated that the proposed code will provide those who use road salts with a way to reduce harm to the environment without jeopardizing road safety 
since the dissemination of the december report  we have endeavored to work more closely with the national government as well as provinces and municipalities to better manage the use  storage and release of our road salts 
as a result  we believe it has become less likely that road salts will be designated as a toxic substance 
we cannot predict whether the proposal to designate road salt as a toxic substance will be finalized or the promulgation of any other future regulation 
standardized guidelines for the use and storage of road salt or any alternate deicing products may cause us to suffer reduced sales and incur substantial costs and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  while we are not aware of any similar governmental proposals for such designation of road salt in either the united states or the united kingdom  we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not arise 
our operations are dependent on our rights to mine our property and having received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities 
we hold numerous governmental  environmental  mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities 
a decision by a governmental agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval  or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 
expansion of our existing operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals 
we currently do not have any material pending permits or approvals 
in addition  we are aware of an aboriginal land claim filed by the chippewas of nawash and the chippewas of saugeen the chippewas in the ontario superior court against the attorney general of canada and her majesty the queen in right of ontario 
the chippewas claim that a large part of the land under lake huron was never conveyed by treaty and therefore belongs to the chippewas 
the land claimed includes land under which our goderich mine operates and has mining rights granted to it by the government of ontario 
we are not a party to this court action 
similar claims are pending with respect to other parts of the great lakes by other aboriginal claimants 
we have been informed by the ministry of the attorney general of ontario that canada takes the position that the common law does not recognize aboriginal title to the great lakes and its connecting waterways 
we do not believe that this action will result in a material adverse financial effect on the company 
protection of proprietary technology our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
we cannot assure you that any of our applications for protection of our intellectual property rights will be approved or that others will not infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights 
the patents we currently have in place expire between and we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
many of our important brand names are registered as trademarks in the united states and foreign countries 
these registrations can be renewed if the trademark remains in use 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  we may lose the competitive advantage provided by our intellectual property 
as a result  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  we may experience significant increases in the cost of labor or a disruption in our operations 
as of december   we had  employees  of which are employed in the united states  in canada and in the united kingdom 
approximately of our us workforce and of our global workforce is represented by labor unions 
of our nine material collective bargaining agreements  four will expire in  three will expire in and two will expire in additionally  approximately of our workforce is employed in europe where trade union membership is common 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are good  as a result of general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  political and other factors beyond our control  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations 
we rely on independent distributors and the loss of a substantial number of these distributors may reduce our profits and sales 
in addition to our own direct sales force  we depend on the services of independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers 
in  of our sales  net of shipping and handling costs  were generated through these independent distributors 
many of these independent distributors are not bound to us by exclusive 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k distribution contracts and may offer products of  and services to  businesses that compete with ours 
in addition  the majority of the distribution contracts we have with these independent distributors are cancelable by the distributor after providing us with notice  which on average is six months prior to termination 
the loss of a substantial number of these distributors or the decision by many of these distributors to offer competitors products to the end customers could materially reduce our sales and profits 
if we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses  our growth may be limited and our financial condition adversely affected 
our business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions of small complementary businesses 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms  identify suitable businesses to acquire or successfully integrate acquired businesses in the future 
we compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of other small complementary businesses 
these competition and regulatory considerations may result in fewer acquisition opportunities 
if we cannot complete acquisitions  our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
our business is dependent upon highly skilled personnel  and the loss of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our development and results of operations 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managers and other personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our development and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our key employees

we may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
we currently declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  earnings  legal requirements  restrictions in our debt agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit annual dividends to million plus of preceding year net income  as defined  and may restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock if cmg s total leverage ratio exceeds or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the facilities 
the terms of our indentures may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the payment of a cash dividend on our common stock is considered a restricted payment under our indentures and we are restricted from paying any cash dividend on our common stock unless we satisfy minimum requirements with respect to our cumulative consolidated net income plus any additional cash proceeds received upon the issuance of our common stock and our fixed charge coverage ratio 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness  including our senior secured credit facilities  will permit us to pay dividends on our common stock 
shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect our common stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities

headquartered in the kansas city metropolitan area  compass is the second leading salt producer in north america and the largest in the united kingdom 
we operate production and packaging facilities  including the largest rock salt mine in the world in goderich  ontario and the largest salt mine in the united kingdom in winsford  cheshire 
our product lines include salt for highway deicing  consumer deicing  water conditioning  consumer and industrial food preparation  agriculture and industrial applications 
in addition  compass is north america s leading producer of sulfate of potash sop  which is used in the production of specialty fertilizers for high value crops and turf 
salt is indispensable and enormously versatile with more than  uses 
in addition  there is an absence of cost effective alternatives 
as a result  our cash flows are not materially impacted by economic cycles 
we are among the lowest cost salt producers in our markets because our salt deposits are high grade and among the most extensive in the world  and because we use effective mining techniques and efficient production processes 
our sop plant is the largest in north america and one of only two all natural solar sop plants in the western hemisphere 
our north american salt mines and sop production facility are near either water or rail transport systems  which minimizes our shipping and handling costs 
because the highway deicing business constitutes about half of our annual sales  our business is seasonal and results may vary depending on the severity of the winter weather in our markets 
we focus on building intrinsic value by improving our earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  based on a normal winter weather season and by improving our cost structure 
our management team s stewardship is to generate consistent cash flow despite weather variations and to maximize value from our cash flow generated from operations 
we can employ our operating cash flow to pay dividends  re invest in our business  pay down debt and make small tuck in acquisitions 
management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventory allowances we record allowances for unrecoverable  unusable or slow moving finished goods and raw materials and supplies inventory 
we adjust the value of certain inventory to the estimated market value to the extent that management s assumptions of future demand  market or functional conditions indicate the cost basis is either in excess of market or the inventory will not be utilized or sold in future operations 
if actual demand or conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
mineral interests as of december   we maintained million of net mineral properties as a part of property  plant and equipment 
mineral interests include probable mineral reserves 
we lease mineral reserves at several of our extraction facilities 
these leases have varying terms and many provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific amount per ton of mineral extracted or as a percentage of revenue 
mineral interests are primarily amortized on a units of production method based on internal and third party estimates of recoverable reserves 
our rights to extract minerals are contractually limited by time or lease boundaries 
if we are not able to continue to extend lease agreements  as we have in the past  at commercially reasonable terms  without incurring substantial costs or incurring material modifications to the existing lease terms and conditions  the assigned lives may be less than that projected by management  or if the actual size  quality or recoverability of the minerals is less than that projected by management  then the rate of amortization could be increased or the value of the reserves could be reduced by a material amount 
income taxes developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our potential tax exposure items requires significant judgment and assumptions as well as a thorough knowledge of the tax laws in various jurisdictions 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the assessment of the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  the weight of that evidence and the extent such evidence 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all  or a portion of  the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we consider the sources and timing of taxable income  including the reversal of existing temporary differences  ability to carryback tax attributes to prior periods  qualifying tax planning strategies  and estimates of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
in determining future taxable income  our assumptions include the amount of pre tax operating income according to different state  federal and international taxing jurisdictions  the origination of future temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about material estimates  assumptions and uncertainties in connection with the forecasts of future taxable income  the merits in tax law and assessments regarding previous taxing authorities proceedings or written rulings  and  while they are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses  differences in our actual operating results or changes in our tax strategies  tax credits or our assessment of the tax merits of our positions could affect our future assessments 
as of december  we had million of deferred tax assets resulting from prior year s us nol carryforwards and million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that can be used to reduce our future tax liability 
as a result of our analysis of the realization of our deferred tax assets at december   we concluded that million of valuation allowance was required for our deferred tax assets related to our us net operating loss carryforwards because management believes they will not be realized 
in the future  if we determine  based on the existence of sufficient evidence  that more or less of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made 
the actual amount of the deferred tax assets realized could ultimately be materially different from those recorded  as impacted by changes in income tax laws and actual operating results that differ from historical and forecasted amounts 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities in accordance with sfas for anticipated tax issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
taxes on foreign earnings our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of we established a domestic reinvestment plan which was approved by our board of directors  and determined the company would repatriate million of qualifying foreign earnings pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
under the jobs act  repatriated earnings during this one year period would be allowed a one time dividends received deduction of  resulting in a federal tax rate of approximately on the repatriated earnings 
notwithstanding amounts repatriated under the jobs act  we believe that the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested 
pension plans we select our actuarial assumptions for our pension plans after consultation with our actuaries and investment consultants as our advisors 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases which are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans 
if actual conditions or results vary from those projected by management  adjustments may be required in future periods to meet minimum pension funding  thereby increasing pension expense and our pension liability 
we have two defined benefit pension plans covering some of our employees in the united states and the united kingdom 
the size of the us plan is not significant as compared to the uk plan 
the uk plan was closed to new participants in we set our discount rate for the uk plan based on aa corporate bond yields with an average duration closely matching the benefit payments under our plan 
the assumption for the return on plan assets is determined based on expected returns applicable to each type of investment within the portfolio 
assumed salary increases are set considering the statutory provisions that are used to calculate the actual pension benefits in the uk our funding policy has been to make the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations  which have totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our pension plans 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of equity compensation instruments and environmental accruals  require difficult judgments on complex matters 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached to date by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  future decisions cannot be predicted with confidence 
results of operations the following table presents consolidated financial information with respect to sales from continuing operations for the years ended december   and on december   we sold our weston point  england evaporated salt business  which results have been classified as discontinued operations

such shipping and handling fees were million during the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in shipping and handling related fees for the year ended december  was primarily due to the increased volume of products sold as compared to product sales for the year ended december  of million increased million  or compared to million for the same period in salt product sales for the year ended december  of million increased million  or compared to million for the same period in primarily due to increased sales volumes in our highway deicing product lines million and increased sales volumes in our general trade product line million 
the increased sales volumes in our highway deicing product line came from north america and the uk approximately  tons and  tons  respectively and was primarily due to a combination of increased contract bid volumes awarded in north america and slightly above average winter weather in the uk in the first quarter of compared to an extremely mild first quarter in winter weather was also above average in north america in both and the increased sales volumes in our north american general trade product line of approximately  tons was primarily due to strong consumer deicing sales in the first quarter in areas where our consumer deicing products are sold

dividends on preferred stock we repurchased and redeemed all of our redeemable preferred stock during as a result  there were no dividends on redeemable preferred stock after the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historical cash flow our historical cash flows from operating activities have generally been stable 
we have used cash generated from operations to meet our working capital needs  to fund capital expenditures  to pay dividends and to voluntarily make early repayments on our debt 
when we cannot meet our liquidity or capital needs with cash from operations due to the seasonality of our business  we meet those needs with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to meet the ongoing requirements for debt service  any declared dividends and capital expenditures from these sources 
for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  increased million over december  on december  we sold our weston point  england evaporated salt business in a cash transaction for approximately million  subject to a working capital adjustment 
we plan to use approximately million of the proceeds to provide additional funding to the uk pension plan and the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate matters  including debt reduction 
historical cash flows generated from this business were not material 
net cash flow generated by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from the year ended december  the decrease results from million of increased working capital needs compared with fourth quarter sales in increased million over  leading to million of higher accounts receivable balances and million of lower inventories 
the redemption of our senior subordinated notes discussed below in december resulted in an early payment of interest on those notes  contributing to a million reduction in current liabilities as compared to december  net cash generated by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as our capital expenditures nearly offset the proceeds received from the sale of our uk evaporated salt business 
our capital expenditures of million included million of routine replacements to maintain our facilities and cost reduction projects  and million of expenditures to begin the expansion of our magnesium chloride facilities and to start construction of an underground rock salt mill in canada 
we expect to spend an additional million to complete these projects by mid year during  we voluntarily made million of early payments to repay the outstanding principal balance on our existing term loan 
during the fourth quarter of  we replaced our existing credit facilities with the new million senior secured credit agreement credit agreement as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we borrowed against our new credit agreement to complete a tender offer and redeem million of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with the redemption  we incurred million in tender premium and related fees 
the remaining million of outstanding senior subordinated notes are callable in august additionally  during  we made million of dividend payments 
for the year ended december  net cash flow generated by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash generated from operating activities includes million provided by a decrease in working capital 
the primary working capital reductions were increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and decreases in inventories of million  offset in part by an increase in receivables of million 
these changes were primarily related to increased sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in net cash flow used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we had capital expenditures during of million to maintain our business and million for cost reduction and new opportunity projects 
net cash flow used by financing activities was million and was primarily due to million in voluntary principal repayments that reduced the amount of long term debt outstanding 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k under our term loan credit facility  million of dividends paid and a million pay down of our revolving credit facility 
these outflows were partially offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
for the year ended december  net cash flow generated by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
operating cash flows included million used to fund increased working capital needs 
the primary increase in working capital was an increase in receivables of million  offset in part by decreases in inventories of million and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
these changes are indicative of the seasonal nature of highway deicing product line sales with differences primarily related to changes in late december quarter sales versus the prior year 
net cash flow used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
we had capital expenditures during of million to maintain our business and million for cost reduction and new opportunity projects 
we also spent million related to our purchase of certain intangible assets related to mosaic s former sop business 
net cash flow used by financing activities was million and was primarily due to a million repurchase of common stock  a million voluntary principal repayment that reduced the amount of long term debt outstanding under our term loan credit facility  million related to the redemption of preferred stock  including accrued dividends  and million of deferred financing costs 
these outflows were partially offset by million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the receipt of million from mosaic to pay income taxes for periods prior to the recapitalization which were indemnified by mosaic 
additionally  in  we issued the subordinated discount notes and used the proceeds of approximately million to pay a dividend on our common stock 
capital resources our primary sources of liquidity will continue to be cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the recapitalization 
our significant debt service obligations could  under certain circumstances  materially affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
see item a  risk factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december   we had million remaining of senior subordinated notes due additionally  we had million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due and million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated discount notes due under our new million credit agreement  we had million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan and million of borrowings outstanding the revolving credit facilities 
letters of credit totaling million reduced available borrowing capacity to million 
in the future  we may borrow additional amounts under the revolving credit facility to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures  and for other general corporate purposes 
in connection with the recapitalization  we received nols and expect to realize cash tax savings if these nols are able to be utilized 
as of december   we had approximately million of nols remaining that expire between and these nols may be used to offset a portion of future taxable income  through the year  and thereby reduce our us federal income taxes otherwise payable 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  imposes significant limitations on the utilization of nols in the event of an ownership change  as defined in section of the code 
generally  an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership by value of that corporation by one or more stockholders  including specified groups of stockholders who in the aggregate own at least of that corporation s stock including a group of public stockholders  exceeds percentage points over a three year testing period 
the company has incurred three ownership changes  placing annual limitations on the amount of each loss carryforward utilization 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to use all of the nols to offset future taxable income or that the nols will not become subject to additional limitations due to future ownership changes 
due to the uncertainty that these carryforwards will be utilized  a valuation allowance of million at december  has been established against the deferred tax asset for the portion of the carryforward that we did not conclude was more likely than not to be utilized 
we have two defined benefit pension plans for certain of our uk and us employees 
our cash funding policy is to make the minimum annual contributions required by applicable regulations  although we expect to make a special contribution of approximately million in to fund the portion of the past benefits related to employees of the discontinued evaporated salt business in the uk since the plans accumulated benefit obligations are in excess of the fair value of the plans assets  we may be required to use cash from operations above our historical levels to further fund these plans in the future 
at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial statements

our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  to pay the interest on  or to refinance our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our senior credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs over the next months 
as a holding company  our investments in our operating subsidiaries  including compass minerals group  constitute substantially all of our operating assets 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our operating assets 
our principal source of the cash we need to pay our obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
the terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit the transferability of assets and the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries can distribute to us 
the terms of our senior credit facilities also restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends to us in order to fund cash interest payments on the senior discount notes and the senior subordinated discount notes if we do not comply with the provisions relating to the adjusted total leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  or if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under our senior secured credit facilities 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain these ratios 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  when due 
if we consummate an acquisition  our debt service requirements could increase 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
american jobs creation act of we maintain undistributed foreign earnings outside of the united states in canada and the united kingdom 
most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income taxes  less applicable realizable foreign tax credits  if any 
prior to the fourth quarter of we had not provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  since these foreign earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us the american jobs creation act of  enacted on october  the jobs act  provides for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
to qualify for the deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company s chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
during the fourth quarter of  our chief executive officer established and our board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriation of million of qualified foreign earnings before the end of our february  tax year 
repatriation will increase liquidity in the us  with a corresponding reduction in liquidity at our foreign subsidiaries 
some foreign subsidiaries will be required to borrow a portion of the distribution in order to repatriate their earnings to the us we expect our foreign cash flows will be sufficient to repay any foreign debt and replenish foreign cash balances through the normal course of business 
we utilize a variety of tax planning

sensitivity analysis related to ebitda management uses a variety of measures to evaluate the performance of cmi 
we analyze components of the consolidated financial statements to identify certain trends and evaluate specific performance areas while the consolidated financial statements  taken as a whole  provide an understanding of our overall results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition to using gaap financial measures  such as gross profit  net earnings and cash flows generated by operating activities  management uses ebitda  a non gaap financial measure to evaluate the operating performance of our core business operations because our resource allocation  cost of capital and income tax positions are managed at a corporate level  apart from the activities of the operating segments  and the operating facilities are located in different taxing jurisdictions which can cause considerable variation in net income 
ebitda is not calculated under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows or other financial data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our overall profitability or liquidity 
ebitda excludes interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization  each of which is an essential element of our cost structure and cannot be eliminated 
our borrowings are a significant component of our capital structure and interest expense is a continuing cost of debt 
we are also required to pay income taxes  a required and on going consequence of our operations 
we have a significant investment in capital assets and depreciation and amortization reflect the utilization of those assets in order to generate revenues 
consequently  any measure that excludes these elements has material limitations 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating performance  this term is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
the calculation of ebitda as used by management is set forth in the table below 
for the year ended december  net earnings from continuing operations interest expense income tax expense depreciation  depletion and amortization related to continuing operations a ebitda a amount excludes million  million and million of expense related to discontinued operations during  and  respectively 
ebitda does however include other items  both cash and non cash in nature  which management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of our core business operations 
during  we replaced our existing credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility  and we completed a tender offer and redeemed million of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with these transactions  we expensed million of deferred financing costs  net of issuance premium related to the retired debt  and expensed million of tender premium and related fees 
during  apollo terminated the amended management consulting agreement resulting in a final payment of million for all services rendered under the agreement and we expensed million for costs associated with the two secondary offerings of our stock 
ebitda for includes costs of amending our senior credit facilities of million  a gain from the early extinguishment of debt totaling million and expenses of million incurred in connection with the ipo 
ebitda also includes other non operating income and expenses  primarily foreign exchange losses resulting from the translation of intercompany obligations  totaling million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
effects of currency fluctuations and inflation we conduct operations in canada  the united kingdom and the united states 
therefore  our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction risk and currency translation risk 
we incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enter into either a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
with respect to currency translation risk  our financial condition and results of operations are measured and recorded in the relevant local currency and then translated into us dollars for inclusion in our historical consolidated financial statements 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
the majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in us dollars  with pounds sterling and canadian dollars also being significant 
we generated of our sales in foreign currencies  and we incurred of our total operating expenses in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have million of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the net weakening us dollar against these currencies since has had a positive impact on our sales and adjusted ebitda 
significant changes in the value of the canadian dollar  the euro or pound sterling relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on us dollar denominated debt  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
seasonality we experience a substantial amount of seasonality in salt sales 
the result of this seasonality is that sales and operating income are generally higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower during the second and third quarters of each year 
in particular  sales of highway and consumer deicing salt products are seasonal as they vary based on the severity of the winter conditions in areas where the product is used 
following industry practice in north america  we stockpile sufficient quantities of deicing salt in the second  third and fourth quarters to meet the estimated requirements for the winter season 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  that is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be 
table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to follow guidance previously set forth in sfas and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
additionally  sfas r requires any actual tax benefits realized in excess of the benefit related to accrued compensation expense to be classified as a financing cash flow in the statement of cash flows 
the company has recognized compensation expense for the fair value of stock based compensation in its financial statements in accordance with the fair value method sfas for all periods presented  although we have historically included excess tax benefits as an operating cash flow 
the company will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of  using the modified prospective method 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the sec staff issued additional guidance on sfas r in the form of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of fas r while enhancing the information that investors receive 
sab creates a framework that is premised on two themes a considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement fas r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and b reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
key topics covered by sab include a valuation models sab reinforces the flexibility allowed by fas r to choose an option pricing model that meets the standard s fair value measurement objective  b expected volatility the sab provides guidance on when it would be appropriate to rely exclusively on either historical or implied volatility in estimating expected volatility  and c expected term the new guidance includes examples and some simplified approaches to determining the expected term under certain circumstances 
the company will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with its adoption of sfas r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business is subject to various types of market risks that include  but are not limited to  interest rate risk  foreign currency translation risk and commodity pricing risk 
management may take actions that would mitigate our exposure to these types of risks including entering into forward purchase contracts and other financial instruments 
however  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will eliminate or substantially reduce these risks 
we do not enter into any financial instrument arrangements for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of december   we had million of debt outstanding under the term loan and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  each bearing interest at variable rates 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability in interest rates relative to million notional amount of our new term loan 
accordingly  our earnings and cash flows will be affected by changes in interest rates to the extent the principal balance is unhedged 
assuming no change in the amount of term loan outstanding and an average level of revolving credit facility  a one hundred basis point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings would increase the interest expense related to the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt by approximately million 
actual results may vary due to changes in the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and actual changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we conduct our business primarily in canada and the united kingdom as well as the united states 
our operations may  therefore  be subject to volatility because of currency fluctuations  inflation changes and changes in political and economic conditions in these countries 
sales and expenses are frequently denominated in local currencies and results of operations may be affected adversely as currency fluctuations affect our product prices and operating costs or those of our competitors 
we may engage in hedging operations  including forward foreign exchange contracts  to reduce the exposure of our cash flows to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we will not engage in hedging for speculative investment reasons 
our historical results do not reflect any foreign exchange hedging activity 
there can be no assurance that any hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating currencies 
see item a  risk factors economic and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business  including economic loss and a negative impact on earnings 
considering our foreign earnings  a hypothetical unfavorable change in the exchange rates compared to the us dollar would have an estimated million impact on operating earnings for the year ended december  actual changes in market prices or rates will differ from hypothetical changes 
commodity pricing risk commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities we have a hedging policy to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
the notional volumes hedged are based on a combination of factors including estimated natural gas usage  current market prices and historical market prices 
we enter into contractual gas price swaps to effectively fix the purchase price of our natural gas requirements up to months in advance of the physical purchase of the natural gas and hedge up to approximately of our expected natural gas usage 
we have determined that these financial instruments qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity  as amended 

table of contents compass minerals international  inc 
form k the notional amount of natural gas derivative contracts outstanding at december  expiring within one year and those expiring in greater than one year total million and million british thermal units  respectively 
excluding natural gas hedged with derivative instruments  a hypothetical adverse change in our natural gas prices during the year ended december  would have increased our cost of sales by approximately million 
actual results will vary due to actual changes in market prices and consumption
