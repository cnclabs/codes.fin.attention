table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in item of this form k 
overview we develop and market software solutions and service offerings that are designed to enable our customers to access  web enable and integrate enterprise information systems 
these solutions assist our customers in their efforts to leverage the investment they have in their corporate business applications  processes and data 
we provide a range of personal computer  browser based and server based software products and tools 
these products allow our customers to access and leverage applications  business processes and data on ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers  ibm mid range computers such as the iseries  in packaged applications  middleware and databases such as sap  siebel  oracle and peoplesoft  amongst others  and on unix and microsoft based servers 
we provide support  maintenance  and technical consultation services to our customers in association with the products we develop and market 
we provide applications and management consultancy to our customers primarily in association with the server based products we deliver that are designed to allow customers to develop and deploy new web based applications and services 
four important industry trends have strong influences on our business strategy the adoption of electronic commerce by major corporations worldwide and the increasing acceptance of these approaches in mid sized companies  the continuing development of the internet  intranets and extranets for delivery of mission critical business applications in large and mid sized companies  the desire on the part of corporations to make business processes and information broadly accessible internally and externally to their employees and business partners  and the continued mobilization of users of personal computers and the proliferation of wireless and handheld devices requiring corporate system access on a global basis 
the growth of the internet has also been matched by an increase in the use of mobile computing allowing users to access a company s computer systems from remote locations within the confines of an organization s security and access control policies 
as the internet continues to grow  the number of different communication and inter networking options required by major corporations to support their businesses is also increasing 
the number and type of mobile computing and communication devices now includes wireless handheld devices  pdas  internet and web enabled cellular phones and smartphones 
we anticipate that these trends will continue to accelerate over the next several years 
we believe that our customers require a single set of solutions that address the traditional need for host access combined with the growing need for the presentation of existing corporate systems with a web application look and feel  and the delivery of existing corporate processes and transactions as reusable programmatic components such as web services 
in assessing the change in the marketplace  we focus our sales and marketing efforts on addressing the changing and evolving needs of our customers 
our products are designed and built to incorporate reusable components and technologies and to utilize common underlying services such as user management  system management  security  auditing and reporting 
several technologies are employed to provide solutions  which include traditional thick client or desktop solutions  thin client or browser based solutions  and zero footprint or server based solutions and application adapter or connector technologies 

table of contents within this marketplace  we believe the trend is away from desktop solutions and toward zero footprint solutions 
we believe this movement is primarily driven by a company s desire to reduce the total cost of ownership associated with deploying and maintaining these solutions 
we also believe that a major element of our customer base will deploy a mixture of all types of solutions 
the market is also made up of a number of products that allow organizations to reduce costs or increase revenue by allowing them  or their business partners  to interact via the internet with corporate business applications that are the backbone of their business processes 
a primary example of this kind of solution is found in self service call center applications 
companies are building solutions that allow customers to determine order status over the internet without involving a customer support representative 
this approach simultaneously minimizes staffing costs and improves customer service 
our products assist our customers in building solutions that quickly transform corporate applications into web based solutions 
acquisitions we acquired librados  inc librados in october  an early stage company selling adapters which allow data and information to be accessed and extracted from packaged applications  middleware and databases such as sap  siebel  oracle  jd edwards  peoplesoft  and others 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of netmanage common stock valued at approximately million 
transaction costs were approximately million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the results of operations of librados from the date of acquisition have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded net liabilities of million  identified intangible assets of million and goodwill of million 
in addition  shares of netmanage common stock may be issued under the terms of the related agreement if a certain level of cumulative revenue from the sale of librados product is achieved by december  in the quarter ended september   former key librados executives terminated their employment with us and therefore the remaining unamortized value of the related employment agreements of  was expensed 
our primary growth strategy is based on the development of new software products and the enhancement of existing products internally 
however we have had a history of acquisitions and we regularly evaluate product and technology acquisition opportunities 
we may make additional technology focused acquisitions in the future if we determine that such an acquisition would further our corporate strategy and enhance our ability to address time to market concerns 
as described in detail in item a  under the heading risk factors  acquisitions involve a number of risks  including risks relating to the integration of the acquired company s operations  personnel and products 
our inability to integrate recent or future acquisitions could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million which resulted in an effective tax rate benefit of 
this tax benefit primarily relates to a refund of non us taxes of million  a favorable settlement of a non us tax audit resulting in a release of accrued tax reserves of million and a liquidation of non us entities resulting in a release of accrued tax reserves of million 
we do not anticipate realizing similar tax benefits in application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other information available to us at the time and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from two sources product revenue  which includes software license and royalty revenue  and support and services revenue  which includes software license maintenance and  to a lesser extent  consulting services 
we license our software products both on a term basis and on a perpetual basis 
our term based arrangements are primarily for a period of months 
we also license our software in both source code and object code format 
we apply the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and related amendments and interpretations to all transactions involving the licensing of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses to end users and resellers when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier or when a software key has been transmitted to our customer 
product is sold without the right of return  except for distributor inventory rotation of old or excess product 
certain of our sales are made to domestic distributors under agreements allowing rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
accordingly  we defer recognition of such sales until the distributor sells the merchandise 
we recognize sales to international resellers upon shipment  provided all other revenue recognition criteria as mentioned above have been met 
we give rebates to customers on a limited basis 
these rebates are presented in our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction of revenue 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due if the customer is credit worthy or upon receipt of cash 
we assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash if the customer is not credit worthy 
for sales  except those completed over the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or equivalent customer commitment or signed license agreement as evidence of a contractual arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
for arrangements with multiple elements for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement using the residual value method based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are generally based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the sales contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

table of contents service revenues are derived from providing our customers with software updates or upgrades for existing software products  user documentation and technical support under annual service agreements 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the terms of such agreements 
if such services are included in the initial licensing fee  the value of the services determined based on vsoe of fair value is unbundled and recognized ratably over the related service period 
service revenues derived from consulting and training are deferred and recognized when the services are performed and collection is deemed probable 
to date  consulting revenue has not been significant 
allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns and rebates in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms 
we apply significant judgment in connection with assessing whether or not our accounts receivable are collectible 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of our allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in establishing our sales return and rebate allowance  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
our reserves for returns were  and  at december  and  respectively  and represented less than and of total net revenues for and  respectively 
our reserves for rebates were  and  at december  and  respectively  and represented less than and of total net revenues for and  respectively 
restructuring reserves we accrue for restructuring costs when we make a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identifies all significant actions to be taken in conjunction with our response to a change in our strategic plan  product demand  expense structure or other factors such as the date we cease using a facility 
we reassess our prior restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of our restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as commitments are made 
estimates are based on anticipated costs of such restructuring activities and are subject to change 
our restructuring reserves balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for further discussion see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
realization of such carry forwards before they expire is dependent on our generating sufficient future taxable income 
we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire balance of the net deferred tax assets at december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the carry forwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we will adjust these estimates in future periods 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million which resulted primarily in a refund of non us taxes of million  a favorable settlement of a non us tax audit resulting in a release of accrued tax reserves of million and a liquidation of non us entities resulting in a release of accrued tax reserves of million 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires us to make assumptions about future revenues over the life of our software products and services  and the impact that recognizing an impairment has on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet and the net income loss reported in our consolidated statement of operations could be material 
our assumptions about future revenues and sales volumes require significant judgment because actual sales prices and volumes have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in estimating future revenues  we use our sales performance  planned levels of product development  planned new product launches  our internal budgets and industry market estimates of planned market size and growth rates to assist us 
we assess the carrying value of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at a minimum  annually 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that if the fair value of a company s individual reporting unit is less than the reported value of the individual reporting unit  an asset impairment charge must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in connection with the acquisition of librados in october  we recorded an intangible asset related to employment contracts for certain individuals 
in the quarter ended september   former key librados executives terminated their employment and the remaining unamortized value of the related employment agreement of  was expensed 
we reviewed our recorded goodwill for impairment at december  and the indicated fair value of the goodwill was substantially greater than the carrying value  and accordingly  we concluded that there was no impairment as of these dates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
restructurings during and earlier years  we undertook a number of initiatives intended to control costs and reduce operating expenses including the discontinuance of several low revenue generating products and the implementation of worldwide restructurings of our operations as a result of acquisitions and prevailing market conditions 
we believe that the objectives set forth in our prior initiatives have been met and at this time we only foresee the need for a periodic change in estimate due to foreign exchange valuation on our non us facility obligations 

table of contents on january  we announced a restructuring of the company in response to the sluggish north american and european economies 
we believed it was necessary to refocus our operations and reduce our operating expenses to bring them in line with our revised anticipated revenue levels 
we implemented a reduction in our workforce of more than and recorded a million restructuring charge consisting of million relating to employee and other related expenses for employee terminations and million related to facilities no longer needed for company operations as required by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in the first quarter of additional restructuring charges and credits  related to the january restructuring  of million  million and million were recorded in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
in  we recorded a reduction in restructuring expense of approximately million for severance related to european operations 
during  the company recorded an approximately million reduction in our estimate primarily related to the successful sublease of unoccupied space in the ottawa facility 
we anticipate that the execution of the restructuring actions will require total cash expenditures of million which is expected to be funded from internal operations and existing cash balances 
as of december   million has been paid  leaving a remaining restructuring accrued liability of  in years prior to  we recorded restructuring charges related to current economic pressures or as a result of business acquisitions 
as of december   the remaining reserves related to these restructurings were  and  in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities  respectively 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to  shares of our common stock through open market purchases 
no purchases of our common stock were made in or during  we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market at an average purchase price of per share for a total cost of million 
cumulatively  as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total cost of approximately million from to

net revenues historically  a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been derived from software license fees

table of contents and a decline in services revenues of million  or from revenue from the librados acquisition represented approximately and of total net revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in our total net revenues in resulted from continued pressure on it organizations to reduce costs  a longer than anticipated sales cycle and the postponement of purchases of our products by some customers particularly in north america 
we generally ship software products within a short period of time after receipt of an order and therefore we do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders 
from through  we have experienced declines in our revenues on an annual basis 
we believe this has resulted from the soft economic conditions in both north america and europe which has affected our customers purchasing decisions and as a result of our transitioning our business from older  more expensive software solutions to newer technologies and solutions that utilize the internet

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit our amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we are averse to principal loss  and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  liquidity risk  and territory risk
