revenue and income generation the company receives its revenue primarily from earned premium derived from the insurance company operations  commission and fee income generated from the insurance agency operations  finance charges and fee income from the premium finance operations  and investment income from cash generated primarily from the insurance company operation 
the insurance company operation generates approximately of the company s total revenue 
the company s remaining operations constitute a variety of specialty insurance services  each with unique characteristics and individually not material to consolidated revenues 
insurance company operation the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and includes many insurers  ranging from large companies offering a wide variety of products worldwide to smaller  specialized companies in a single state or region offering only a single product 
many of the company s existing or potential competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources  have a higher rating assigned by independent rating organizations such as am best company  have greater experience in the insurance industry and offer a broader line of insurance products than the company 
currently  crusader is writing primarily commercial multiple peril business only in the state of california and is rated b very good with a rating outlook of stable by am best company 
a primary challenge of the property and casualty insurance company operation is contending with the fact that the company sells its products before the ultimate costs are actually known 
when pricing its products  the company projects the ultimate claim and loss adjustment cost that it anticipates will be incurred after the policy is sold 
in addition  other factors such as changes in regulations and legal environment  among other things  can all impact the ultimate cost 
the property and casualty insurance industry is characterized by periods of soft market conditions  in which premium rates are stable or falling and insurance is readily available  and by periods of hard market conditions  where rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase 
the company believes that the hard market that existed in california in the past few years has transitioned to a soft market 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
despite the increased competition in the property and casualty marketplace  the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth  and that underwriting profit is the company s primary goal 
for the year ended december   gross written premium was  a decrease of  compared to for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  favorable development for events of prior years 
for the twelve months ended december   losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured events of the current year were  offset by  favorable development for events of prior years 
the favorable developments resulted from settling or re estimating claims for lesser amounts than they were initially reserved 
other operations the company s other operations generate commissions  fees  and finance charges from various insurance products 
the events that have the most significant economic impact on other operations are as follows unifax primarily sells and services insurance policies for crusader 
the commissions paid by crusader to unifax are eliminated as intercompany transactions and are not reflected as income in the financial statements 
as a result of the decrease in the number of policies sold by unifax during as compared to  policy fee income for the months ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year period 
aib sells and services health insurance policies for individual family and small business groups and receives commissions based on the premiums that it writes 
commissions decreased in the year ended december   compared to the decrease is primarily due to cigna s decision to discontinue its individual family health insurance program over the period from november   through october  aib had been assisting former cigna policyholders to find health coverage with other insurance carriers that aib represents 
aaqhc provides various consumer benefits to its members  including participation in group health care and life insurance policies 
for these services  aaqhc receives membership and fee income from its members 
membership and fee income decreased in the year ended december   compared to the decrease is a result of the decrease in the number of members 
aac provides premium financing for crusader policies that are produced by unifax in california 
finance charges and fees earned by aac during decreased as compared to the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in the number of loans issued in compared to average premium financed decreased from  in to  in investments and liquidity the company generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million at amortized cost at december   compared to million at amortized cost at december  although the investment portfolio increased approximately million at amortized cost or in compared to  investment income for the twelve months ended december  and remained relatively unchanged 
due primarily to the maturity of higher yielding investments and reinvestments in shorter maturities  the annualized yield on the average invested assets decreased from in to in due to the interest rate environment in the past few years  management believed it was prudent to purchase fixed maturity investments with shorter maturities with minimal credit risk 
as of december   the weighted average maturity of the company s fixed maturity investments was years compared to years and years as of december  and december   respectively 
liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of the company s business insurance and insurance services and whereas company growth does not normally require material reinvestments of profits into property or equipment  the cash flow generated from operations usually results in improved liquidity for the company 
because the company is a holding company and operates through its subsidiaries  its cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and the distributions of those earnings to the company 
the cash flow provided by operations in the year ended december   was  a decrease in cash flow of  compared to the cash flow for the year ending december  cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was  a decrease of  in cash provided compared to the year ended december  the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities and from the maturity of its fixed maturity investments primarily to purchase million of fixed maturity securities 
the most significant liquidity risk faced by the company would be adverse development of the insurance company claims  both reported and unreported 
the company has taken measures to address the underlying causes of prior adverse development  however  no assurance can be given that the measures taken will be successful or that the company s estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will be sufficient 
based on the company s current loss and loss expense reserves and expected current and future payments  the company believes that there are no current liquidity issues 
crusader generates a significant amount of cash as a result of its holdings of unearned premium reserves  its reserves for loss payments  and its capital and surplus 
crusader s loss and loss adjustment expense payments are the most significant cash flow requirement of the company 
these payments are continually monitored and projected to ensure that the company has the liquidity to cover these payments without the need to liquidate its investments 
cash and investments excluding net unrealized gains or losses at december   were  compared to  at december   a increase 
crusader s cash and investments at december   was  or of the total held by the company  compared to  or of the total held by the company at december  the company s investments are as follows december  december  december  amount amount amount fixed maturities at amortized cost certificates of deposit    us treasury securities    us government sponsored enterprise securities    industrial and miscellaneous taxable    state and municipal tax exempt    total fixed maturity investments    short term cash investments at cost certificates of deposit    cash deposit in lieu of bond    commercial paper    bank money market accounts    us gov t obligation money market fund    short term us treasury  bank savings accounts    total short term cash investments    total investments    deposits with superior courts to stay execution of judgment pending appeal of crusader claims

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investment securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
the tax exempt interest income earned net of bond premium and discount amortization during the year ended december   was  compared to  in the year ended december  in the year ended december   tax exempt interest income earned totaled  the company s investment guidelines on equity securities limit investments in equity securities to an aggregate maximum of  the company s investment guidelines on fixed maturities limit those investments to high grade obligations with a maximum term of eight years 
the maximum investment authorized in any one issuer is  and the maximum in any one us government agency or us government sponsored enterprise is  this dollar limitation excludes bond premiums paid in excess of par value and us government or us government guaranteed issues 
investments in municipal securities are primarily pre refunded and secured by us treasury securities

during the year ended december   the company did not repurchase any shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company has purchased and retired under the board of directors authorization an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at a cost of  although material capital expenditures may also be funded through borrowings  the company believes that its cash and short term investments at year end  net of trust restriction of  statutory deposits of  cash deposited with superior courts in lieu of bond of  and california insurance company statutory dividend restrictions applicable to crusader plus the cash to be generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet its operating requirements during the next twelve months without the necessity of borrowing funds 
as a california insurance company  crusader is obligated to pay a premium tax on gross premiums written in all states that crusader is admitted 
premium taxes are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the premium tax is in lieu of state franchise taxes and is not included in the provision for state taxes 
the company has certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows within after contractual obligations total year years years years building lease    losses and loss adjustment expense reserves      total      unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates

the effect of inflation on the net income of the company during the years ended december    and was not significant 
the company derives revenue from various sources as discussed below 
insurance company operation premium and loss information of crusader are as follows year ended december gross written premium    net written premium net of reinsurance ceded    earned premium before reinsurance ceded    earned premium net of reinsurance ceded    losses and loss adjustment expenses    gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses    crusader s primary line of business is commercial multiple peril policies

for the year ended december   gross written premium decreased by  over gross written premium for the year ended december   increased by  over the decrease in written premium in and the increase in written premium in are primarily the result of the fluctuations in written premium in the company s apartment program  a program within the company s commercial multiple peril line of business

the company believes that the hard market that existed in california in the past few years has transitioned to a soft market 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company s future writings and growth are dependent on market conditions  competition  and the company s ability to introduce new and profitable products 
the company s average premium per policy issued is as follows year ended direct written policies average december premium issued premium as indicated in the above table  the number of policies issued during the months ended december   decreased by  as compared to the prior year 
the average premium per policy in increased by as compared to the months ended december  as previously discussed  the decrease in the number of policies issued in compared to is primarily a result of the increased competition 
the company believes that rate adequacy is more important than premium growth and that underwriting profit is the company s primary goal 
thus  the average premium per policy issued remained relatively comparable to the prior year 
management s assessment of trends and underwriting results is a primary factor in its decisions to expand or contract its business 
the company continues to believe that it can compete effectively and profitably by offering better service and by marketing its policies through independent agents and brokers 
beginning july   the company had placed moratoriums on all non california business  primarily due to the fact that much of the company s business outside of california has not been profitable 
the company has no short term plan to expand into additional states or to expand its marketing channels 
instead  the company intends to allocate its resources toward improving its california business rates  rules  and forms 
the company writes annual policies and  therefore  earns written premium daily over the one year policy term 
premium earned before reinsurance decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and increased  in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in earned premium before reinsurance in is a direct result of the decrease in written premium in the increase in earned premium before reinsurance in is a direct result of the increase in written premium during and earned ceded premium for the months ended december   decreased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were and for and  respectively 
although direct earned premiums in decreased as compared to  earned ceded premiums decreased primarily as a result of a rate decrease by the company s reinsurers effective january  earned ceded premiums for the months ended december   increased  to  compared to  for the months ended december  earned ceded premiums as a percentage of direct earned premiums were and for and  respectively 
the and earned ceded premium to direct earned premium ratio decreased primarily as a result of rate decrease by the company s reinsurers 
the rates decreased primarily due to the company s improving ceded loss experience

premium ceded under the provisionally rated contract  which was canceled on a runoff basis effective december   is subject to adjustment based on the amount of losses ceded  limited by a maximum percentage that can be charged by the reinsurer 
crusader s and st layer primary excess of loss treaty provides for a contingent commission equal to of the net profit  if any  accruing to the reinsurer 
the first accounting period for the contingent commission covers the period from january   through december  the company will calculate and report to the reinsurer its net profit  if any  within days after months following the end of the first accounting period  and within days after the end of each month period thereafter until all losses subject the to agreement have been finally settled 
based on losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded including incurred but not reported losses as of december   no contingent commission has been accrued 
the st layer primary excess of loss treaty does not provide for a contingent commission 
crusader s direct earned premium  earned ceded premium  and ceding commission are as follows year ended december direct earned premium    earned ceded premium excluding provisionally rated ceded premium    provisionally rated ceded premium    total earned ceded premium    ceding commission    earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission    ratios to direct earned premium direct ceded premium earned ceded premium  net of ceding commission the combined ratio is the sum of the net ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred including a provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr to net premiums earned loss ratio and the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned expense ratio 
the following table shows the loss ratios  expense ratios  and combined ratios of crusader as derived from data prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as indicated in the above table  the loss ratio for the year ended december   decreased to from in and in the continuous decrease in the loss ratio was primarily due to improvements in the provision for prior years incurred losses 
generally  if the combined ratio is below  an insurance company has an underwriting profit  if it is above  a company has an underwriting loss 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance increased  from  as of december   to  as of december  the increase in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in is primarily a result of an  increase to direct ibnr reserves  from  as of december  to  as of december reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance increased  from  as of december   to  as of december  the increase in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in is primarily a result of a  increase to direct ibnr reserves  from  as of december  to  as of december  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses before reinsurance for each of crusader s lines of business were as follows year ended december line of business cmp    other liability    other    total    the company s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related loss adjustment expenses of the insurance company operation 
crusader sets loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at each balance sheet date at management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that it anticipates will be made to settle all losses incurred and related loss adjustment expenses incurred as of that date for both reported and unreported losses 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses were  or of net premium earned for the year ended december   compared to  or of net premium earned for the year ended december   and compared to  or of net premium earned for the year ended december  the company incurred favorable development of prior years losses of  for the year ended december   compared to favorable development of prior years losses of  for the year ended december  the company incurred adverse development of prior years losses of  for the year ended december  analysis of the roll forward of losses and loss adjustment expenses the following table provides an analysis of the roll forward of crusader s losses and loss adjustment expenses  including a reconciliation of the ending balance sheet liability for the periods indicated year ended december reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at beginning of year net of reinsurance    incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of current year    increase decrease in provision for events of prior years    total losses and loss adjustment expenses    payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year    losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years    total payments    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year net of reinsurance    reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year    reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at end of year per balance sheet  gross of reinsurance    in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported for gaap as assets rather than netted against the corresponding liability for such items on the balance sheet 
as a result of crusader underwriting losses that began in the year ended december   crusader s management has been analyzing and acting upon various components of its underwriting activity which it believed was primarily attributable to those losses 
the company believes that implementation of management s actions on these underwriting components has contributed to improved operating results 
the development of prior years losses and loss adjustment expenses in and was lower than previously anticipated 
accordingly  the company reduced the estimate of its ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses for those prior accident years

the termination of policyholders continued through october  the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program did not affect the cigna small group program 
primarily due to the discontinuance of cigna s individual and family health insurance program  membership and fee income decreased as these terminated members were no longer members of the association

to avoid underwriting losses for the non affiliated insurance company that it represents  bedford continues to produce business only at rates that it believes to be adequate 
the company cannot determine how long the existing market conditions will continue  nor in which direction they might change 
the company s subsidiary us risk managers  inc  us risk ceased providing insurance claim administration services to the non affiliated daily automobile insurer as of december   and it is currently inactive 
as of december   the non affiliated insurer assumed the claim administration responsibility for all outstanding and ibnr claims 
during  the company recognized  of claim administration fees that were unearned as of december  although us risk is inactive  the company is still responsible for all claim administration cost arising from losses covered by premiums for which it received a claim administration fee 
during and  the company did not receive any claim administration fees and did not incur any future internal claim administration costs 
during  the company recognized an additional amount of  of the  claim administration fees that were unearned as of december  thus  the unearned claim administration reserve as of december   is  and it reflects the estimated costs to complete the claim administration by the non affiliated insurer

also contributing to the decline in the yield on average invested assets is a shorter weighted average maturity of new and reinvested assets

no securities were sold at a loss during  or amortized gross cost fair value unrealized loss months    months    over months    total    at december   the fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss for a continuous periods of to months and to months  both consisted of us treasury securities and investment grade industrial securities 
the fixed maturity investments with a gross unrealized loss position for a continuous period over months consisted of us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  and pre refunded municipal bonds 
the unrealized loss is primarily due to rising interest rates 
the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of  at december   were temporary in nature 
however  facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in market value considered to be other than temporary 
the company did not sell any fixed maturity investment in the years ended december  and operating expenses policy acquisition costs are as follows year ended december policy acquisition costs    ratio to net earned premium gaap ratio policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  premium taxes  inspection fees  and certain other underwriting costs that are directly related to and vary with the production of crusader insurance policies 
these costs include both crusader expenses and allocated expenses of other unico subsidiaries 
on certain reinsurance treaties  crusader receives a ceding commission from its reinsurer that represents a reimbursement of the acquisition costs related to the premium ceded 
no ceding commission is received on facultative  catastrophe  or provisionally rated ceded premium 
policy acquisition costs  net of ceding commission  are deferred and amortized as the related premiums are earned 
the ratio of policy acquisition cost to net earned premium in  and were comparable at 
salaries and employee benefits are as follows year ended december total salaries and employee benefits incurred    less charged to losses and loss adjustment expenses    less capitalized to policy acquisition costs    net amount charged to operating expenses    total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  factors that affected the were general salary increases less than and increases in employee benefits costs  offset by reduction in the number of employees 
total salaries and employee benefits incurred for the year ended december   increased  compared to the year ended december  commissions to agents brokers are as follows year ended december commission to agents brokers    commissions to agents brokers not including commissions on crusader policies that are reflected in policy acquisition costs are generally related to gross commission income from the health and life insurance program  the daily automobile rental insurance program  and the earthquake program 
commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  commissions to agents and brokers decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decreases in both years are primarily the result of a decrease in premiums written and the related decrease in the commission expense in the health and life insurance program 
other operating expenses are as follows year ended december other operating expenses    other operating expenses generally do not change significantly with changes in production 
this is true for both increases and decreases in production 
operating expenses increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  operating expenses decreased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december   was  compared to an income tax expense of  for the year ended december  the effective combined income tax rates for and were and  respectively

in the year ended december   the company recognized an income tax expense of  resulting from an assessment for the years and from the california franchise tax board 
the assessment resulted from a court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board that held that the california statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from a wholly owned insurance subsidiary was unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies and thus was in violation of the interstate commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the ruling concluded that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute was invalid and unenforceable 
california law provides that the proper remedy in such circumstances is to disallow the deduction to those taxpayers that benefited from the deduction 
as a result of the court ruling  in february  the franchise tax board ftb notified the company that it would issue a notice of proposed assessment npa for tax years and of approximately  representing california state franchise taxes plus related interest of approximately  in september  california enacted legislation ab that addresses many aspects of the tax treatment of insurance company owners  including holding companies such as unico 
the legislation provides for an election  applicable if made to all tax years ending after december   and before january   under which a dividend received deduction of up to of dividends paid by an insurer to a non insurer parent is allowed 
the company made the election authorized by ab and  therefore  has reversed of the  income tax expense and of the interest accrued thereon 
in addition  as a result of ab  the company is obligated to establish a state deferred tax liability which represents the company s future state tax liability for all undistributed earnings of crusader since january   in accordance with fasb recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

i  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss should be recognized equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value

significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while every effort is made to ensure the integrity of such estimates  actual results could differ 
management believes the company s current critical accounting policies comprise the following losses and loss adjustment expenses the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgments and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period plus estimates based on experience and industry data for development of case estimates and for unreported losses and loss adjustment expenses 
since the emergence and disposition of claims are subject to uncertainties  the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle claims may vary significantly from the estimated amounts provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the operating results of the periods in which they are made 
management believes that the aggregate reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reasonable and adequate to cover the cost of claims  both reported and unreported 
reinsurance the company s receivable from reinsurers represents an estimate of the amount of our future loss payments that will be recoverable from the company s reinsurers 
these estimates are based upon our estimates of the ultimate losses that the company expects to incur and the portion of those losses that are expected to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of the reinsurance agreements 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  the estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the company s estimate of the amounts receivable from reinsurers is regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
the company s assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers is based primarily upon public financial statements and rating agency data 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at their inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting literature 
at december   all such ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transfer reinsurance 
investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company is required to classify its investments in debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading securities 
the company s fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are stated at market value 
although all of the company s investments are classified as available for sale and the company may sell investment securities from time to time in response to economic and market conditions  its investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality investments to maturity 
short term investments are carried at cost  which approximates market value 
investments in equity securities are carried at market value 
the unrealized gains or losses from fixed maturities and equity securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
when a decline in value of a fixed maturity or equity security is considered other than temporary  a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations based on the specific identification method

on february   the company signed an extension to the lease with no increase in rent to march  the company believes that the terms of the lease at inception and at the time the lease extension was signed were at least as favorable to the company as could have been obtained from non affiliated third parties 
the company utilizes for its own operations approximately of the space it leases

forward looking statements certain statements contained herein  including the sections entitled business  legal proceedings and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts are forward looking 
these statements  which may be identified by forward looking words or phrases such as anticipate  appears  believe  estimates  expect  intend  may  should  and would  involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially include those described under item business competition and item a risk factors  premium rate adequacy relating to competition or regulation  actual versus estimated claim experience  the outcome of rate change filings with regulatory authorities  acceptance by insureds of rate changes  adequacy of rate changes  changes in crusader s am best rating  regulatory changes or developments  the outcome of regulatory proceedings  unforeseen calamities  general market conditions  and the company s ability to introduce new profitable products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of invested assets whose fair values are subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company s invested assets at december  and consisted of the following fixed maturity bonds at amortized cost   short term cash investments at cost   certificates of deposit over year at cost   total invested assets   the company s interest rate risk is primarily in its fixed maturity bond portfolio 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  the longer the maturity  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company limits this risk by investing in securities with maturities no greater than eight years 
in addition  although fixed maturity bonds are classified as available for sale  the company s investment guidelines place primary emphasis on buying and holding high quality bonds to maturity 
because fixed maturity bonds are primarily held to maturity  the change in the market value of these bonds resulting from interest rate movements is unrealized and no gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as separate components of stockholders equity  net of any deferred tax effect 
as of december   the company s unrealized losses net of unrealized gains before income taxes on its fixed maturity bond portfolio were  compared to unrealized gains net of unrealized losses before income taxes of  as of december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the fixed maturity bond portfolio as of december   would decrease by approximately  this decrease would not be reflected in the statements of operations except to the extent that the securities were sold 
the company s short term investments and certificates of deposit have only minimal interest rate risk
