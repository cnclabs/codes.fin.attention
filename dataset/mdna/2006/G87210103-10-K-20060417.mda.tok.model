item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order overview discussion of operating results liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements impact of inflation critical accounting policies and use of estimates overview we are an international  non asset based global integrated logistics company that provides air and ocean freight forwarding  contract logistics  customs clearances  distribution  inbound logistics  truckload brokerage and other supply chain management services 
our business operates in four geographic segments comprised of europe  the americas  asia pacific and africa and in each of these geographic segments our principal sources of income include airfreight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  customs brokerage  contract logistics and other supply chain management services 
our recent growth in gross revenue and net revenue for the years ended january  and january   compared to the respective prior year period  resulted from growth which we attribute to the growth of our existing operations  our acquisitions made during the year and generally favorable exchange rates as 
table of contents compared to the us dollar 
the growth in our existing operations is attributable to serving new clients as well as the increase in business from existing clients  which we collectively refer to as organic growth 
a significant portion of our expenses is variable and adjusts to reflect the level of our business activities 
other than transportation costs  staff costs are our single largest variable expense and are less flexible in the near term as we must staff to meet uncertain future demand 
in february  we initiated a five year strategic operating plan which we named nextleap 
nextleap is our plan designed to help us transition from being a global freight forwarding operator to a global integrated logistics provider offering our customers a comprehensive and integrated range of services across the entire supply chain 
nextleap is a process of expanding and integrating our relationship with our customers and increasing the range of services we offer and provide for our clients through acquisitions and other ways  and thus cannot be measured in terms of percentage implemented 
under nextleap  we are undertaking various efforts to attempt to increase our clients and revenue  improve our operating margins  and train and develop our employees 
as of january   we have completed of the quarters covered by nextleap 
we face numerous challenges in trying to achieve our objectives under this strategic plan  including challenges involving attempts to leverage clients relationships  improve margins  integrate acquisitions and improve our systems 
we also face challenges developing  training and recruiting personnel 
this strategic operating plan requires that we successfully manage our operations and growth which we may not be able to do as well as we anticipate 
in addition  we have begun the process of developing our next long term strategic operating plan and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in developing or implementing our next long term plan 
our industry is extremely competitive and our business is subject to numerous factors beyond our control 
we may not be able to successfully implement nextleap or our next long term strategic operating plan  and no assurances can be given that our efforts associated with these strategic operating plans will result in increased revenues  improved margins or profitability 
if we are not able to increase our revenues and improve our operating margins in the future  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
effect of foreign currency translation on comparison of results our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  due to our global operations  we conduct and will continue to conduct business in currencies other than our reporting currency 
the conversion of these currencies into our reporting currency for reporting purposes will be affected by movements in these currencies against the us dollar 
a depreciation of these currencies against the us dollar would result in lower gross and net revenues reported  however  as applicable costs are also converted from these currencies  costs would also be lower 
similarly  the opposite effect will occur if these currencies appreciate against the us dollar 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency 
as such  when the values of those assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact the net book value of our assets 
we cannot predict the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
description of services revenue recognition airfreight forwarding 
when we act as an airfreight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the shipment 
in both cases  gross revenue and applicable costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 
when we act as an indirect air carrier  we procure shipments from a large number of customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination from a common place of origin  determine the routing over which the consolidated shipment will move  and purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis 
as an indirect air carrier  our gross revenue includes the rate charged to the client for the movement of the shipment on the airline  plus the fees we charge for our other ancillary services such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
airfreight forwarding gross revenue includes expedited movement by ground transportation and our domestic delivery service in south africa 
when we act as an indirect air carrier  our net revenue is the differential between the rates charged to us by the airlines and  where applicable  expedited ground transport operators  and the rates we charge our 
table of contents customers plus the fees we receive for our other services 
therefore  our net revenue is influenced by our ability to charge our customers a rate which is higher than the rate we obtain from the airlines  but which is also lower than the rate the customers could otherwise obtain directly from the airlines 
when we act as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the actual shipment  our gross revenue is primarily derived from commissions received from the airline plus fees for the ancillary services we provide  such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
our gross revenue does not include airline transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent 
accordingly  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different in this situation 
ocean freight forwarding 
when we act as an ocean freight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect ocean carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the ocean carrier which carries the shipment 
our gross revenue and net revenue from ocean freight forwarding and related costs are recognized the same way that our gross revenue and net revenue from airfreight forwarding and related costs are recognized 
when we act as an indirect ocean carrier or non vessel operating common carrier  we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points in a specified time period at an agreed upon rate 
we then solicit freight from customers to fill the containers and consolidate the freight bound for a particular destination from a common shipping point 
as in the case when we act as an indirect airfreight forwarder  our gross revenue in this situation includes the rate charged to the customer for the movement of the shipment on the ocean carrier plus our fees for the other services we provide which are related to the movement of goods such as preparing shipment related documentation 
our net revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carriers and the rates we charge our customers along with the fees we receive for our other ancillary services 
when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier  our gross revenue is generated from the commission we receive from the carrier plus the fees we charge for the ancillary services we provide 
our gross revenue does not include transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier 
under these circumstances  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different 
customs brokerage 
we provide customs clearance and brokerage services with respect to the majority of the shipments we handle as a freight forwarder 
we also provide customs brokerage services for shipments handled by our competitors 
these services include assisting with and performing regulatory compliance functions in international trade 
customs brokerage gross revenue is recognized when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed 
this gross revenue is generated by the fees we charge for providing customs brokerage services  as well as the fees we charge for the disbursements made on behalf of a customer 
these disbursements  which typically include customs duties and taxes  are excluded from our calculations of gross revenue since they represent disbursements made on behalf of customers 
typically  disbursements are included in our accounts receivable and are several times larger than the amount of customs brokerage gross revenue generated 
contract logistics 
our contract logistics services primarily relate to our value added warehousing services and distribution of goods and materials in order to meet customers inventory needs and production or distribution schedules 
our distribution services include receiving  deconsolidation and decontainerization  sorting  put away  consolidation  assembly  cargo loading and unloading  assembly of freight and protective packaging  storage and distribution 
our outsourced services include inspection services  quality centers and manufacturing support 
contract logistics gross revenue is recognized when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business and net revenue excludes transportation costs incurred in providing contract logistics services 
we have expanded our contract logistics services with our acquisitions of perfect logistics in fiscal  ihd and unigistix in fiscal  uti integrated logistics in fiscal and sli in fiscal other supply chain management services 
we also provide a range of other supply chain management services  such as domestic road transportation  truckload brokerage  warehousing services  consulting  order 
table of contents management  planning and optimization services  outsourced distribution services  developing specialized customer specific supply chain solutions  and customized distribution and inventory management services 
our gross revenue in these capacities includes commissions and fees earned by us and are recognized upon performance 
we have expanded our range of other supply chain management services with our acquisitions of concentrek in fiscal and market transport in march acquisitions as a key part of our growth strategy  we continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities in all the markets in which we operate as we seek to continue expanding our service offerings 
during the year ended january   we completed several acquisitions of companies and businesses  including concentrek  maertens and perfect logistics 
in march  we acquired market transport 
these acquisitions  along with our other acquisitions over the past five years  have had  and will have  a significant effect on the comparability of our operating results  increasing gross revenues  net revenues and expenses  over the respective prior periods and to subsequent years  depending on the date of acquisition ie  acquisitions made on february  the first day of our fiscal year  will only affect a comparison with the prior year s results 
the results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
we consider the operating results of an acquired company during the first twelve months following the date of its acquisition to be an acquisition impact or a benefit from acquisitions 
thereafter  we consider the growth in an acquired company s results to be organic growth 
historically  we have financed acquisitions with a combination of cash from operations and borrowed money 
we may borrow additional money in the future to finance acquisitions 
from time to time we enter into non binding letters of intent with potential acquisition targets and we are often in various stages of due diligence and preliminary negotiations with respect to those potential acquisition targets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all  in which case our rate of growth may be negatively impacted 
we may not be successful in integrating the companies we have acquired  or we acquire in the future  and may not achieve expected cost savings on the anticipated timeframe  if at all 
future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the liabilities of such acquired company may not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of such company and the risk that such historical financial statements may be based on assumptions that are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions 
to the extent we make additional acquisitions in the future  the risks associated with our acquisition strategy will be exacerbated

discussion of operating results the following discussion of our operating results explains material changes in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior year 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons  including  but not limited to  those factors described in part i  item a under the heading  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
our consolidated financial statements attached to this report  have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 
geographic segment operating results we manage our business through four geographic segments comprised of europe  the americas  asia pacific and africa  which offer similar products and services 
each geographic segment is managed regionally by executives who are directly accountable to and maintain regular contact with our chief executive officer to discuss operating activities  financial results  forecasts and plans for each geographic region 
for segment reporting purposes by geographic region  airfreight and ocean freight forwarding gross revenues for the movement of goods is attributed to the country where the shipment originates 
gross revenues  as well as net revenues  for all other services are attributed to the country where the services are performed 
net revenues for airfreight and ocean freight forwarding related to the movement of the goods are prorated between the country of origin and the destination country  based on a standard formula 
our gross and net revenues and operating income by operating segment for the fiscal years ended january  and 
table of contents  along with the dollar amount of the changes and the percentage changes between the time periods shown  are set forth in the following tables in thousands year ended january  gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total change to year ended january  from year ended january  amount percentage gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total year ended january  gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total change to year ended january  from year ended january  amount percentage gross net operating gross net operating revenue revenue income revenue revenue income europe americas asia pacific africa corporate total all of our regions reported improvements in gross and net revenues as well as in operating income for fiscal when compared to fiscal 
table of contents our europe region showed improvements in gross and net revenues for fiscal versus fiscal primarily due to organic growth in airfreight forwarding revenues  which were driven primarily by higher shipment volumes in our spanish operations during fiscal compared to fiscal and to increases in our contract logistics gross and net revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal the impact of exchange rates on our gross and net revenues for our europe region as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal was estimated to be less than 
the improvement in operating income in the europe region in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the benefits of network density whereby more revenues were generated in the region without a corresponding increase in the europe region s operating costs 
the increase in gross and net revenues in the americas region for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher gross and net revenues from our contract logistics services  resulting from both an increase in business due to organic growth and to the impact of our unigistix and concentrek acquisitions  which were completed in october and october  respectively 
during fiscal  our americas gross and net revenues also benefited from increased ocean freight forwarding gross and net revenues when compared to the corresponding prior year periods 
these increases in ocean freight forwarding gross and net revenues were primarily driven by increased volumes in the region for fiscal when compared to the prior year as we intentionally sought to grow our ocean freight forwarding business 
additionally  our acquisition of concentrek in october contributed to the increase in gross and net revenues in the americas region for fiscal as compared to fiscal our percentage increase in operating income in the americas region for fiscal versus fiscal was higher than our percentage increase in net revenues during the same period as we were successful in holding the increases in operating costs to a lower rate of growth than our growth in net revenues 
we expect our gross and net revenues in the americas region to increase in the year ending january  which we refer to as fiscal compared to fiscal due to our recent acquisition of market transport in march gross and net revenues in our asia pacific region increased during fiscal when compared to fiscal primarily due to organic growth  resulting from higher overall export shipment volumes especially out of china and hong kong 
additionally  our acquisition of perfect logistics in june contributed to the increase in gross and net revenues in our asia pacific region for fiscal as compared to fiscal at the operating income line  asia pacific continued to be our region with the highest operating profit margin  calculated by dividing operating income for the region by net revenues for the region  reporting for fiscal the higher operating profit margin in this region resulted primarily from having a lower cost structure than our other regions 
the increases in gross and net revenues during fiscal when compared to fiscal for our africa region resulted primarily from organic growth in all of our service lines due to increased levels of business 
contract logistics gross and net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal also benefited from the contributions from our ihd acquisition  which was completed in june the impact of exchange rates on our gross and net revenues for this region as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal was estimated to be less than 
our africa region s operating income for fiscal grew at faster rates than our growth rates for net revenues for fiscal in this region because we focused on improving our operating profit margin  calculated by dividing operating income for the region by net revenues for the region  by increasing revenues while holding costs in check so that they increase at a slower rate than net revenues 
because of the integrated nature of our business  with global customers being served by more than one of our geographic regions and with at least two regions often operating together to carry out our freight forwarding services  we also analyze our revenues by type of service in addition to looking at our results by geographic regions 
by service line  our total increase of million  or  in gross revenue in fiscal over fiscal was due to increases in airfreight forwarding of million  ocean freight forwarding of million  contract logistics of million  other revenue of million and customs brokerage of million 

table of contents we estimate that organic growth accounted for approximately million of the aggregate increases in gross revenue for fiscal versus fiscal  while the balance of the growth for the period was comprised of the impact of acquisitions and to a lesser degree  the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
we believe that net revenue is a better measure than gross revenue of the importance to us of our various services since our gross revenue for our services as an indirect air and ocean carrier includes the carriers charges to us for carriage of the shipment 
when we act as an indirect air and ocean carrier  our net revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carrier and the rates we charge our customers plus the fees we receive for our ancillary services 
net revenue derived from freight forwarding generally is shared between the points of origin and destination 
our gross revenue in our other capacities includes only commissions and fees earned by us and is substantially the same as our net revenue 
the following table shows our net revenues and our operating expenses for the periods presented  expressed as a percentage of total net revenues 
year ended january  net revenues airfreight forwarding ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage contract logistics other total net revenues operating expenses staff costs depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets other operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense losses gains on foreign exchange pretax income provision for income taxes minority interests net income less than one percent 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal our net revenue increase resulted primarily from organic growth from operations in all our geographic regions totaling approximately million  contributions from our acquisitions made during the current year as well as from ihd and unigistix  which were acquired during fiscal  and the impact of generally favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar during fiscal when compared to fiscal on a constant currency basis when we translate our fiscal results using currency exchange rates in 
table of contents effect for fiscal  we estimate that acquisitions and favorable exchange rates accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus fiscal airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from organic growth in all of our regions which totaled approximately million and from the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal our organic growth resulted primarily from higher airfreight shipment volumes in our asia pacific and europe regions  which resulted in higher airfreight forwarding net revenue during fiscal when compared to fiscal ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to organic growth in all of our regions  but particularly noticeable in the asia pacific  africa and americas regions  resulting from higher ocean freight shipment volumes during fiscal when compared to fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of organic growth in our africa and europe regions 
contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from organic growth in all our regions  but particularly noticeable in the americas region  which was driven primarily by new business 
the increase is also attributable to the impact of our acquisitions  including perfect logistics which we acquired in fiscal and ihd and unigistix which were acquired in fiscal we estimate that about one third of the increase in contract logistics net revenue for fiscal was due to the impact of these acquisitions 
other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services including transportation management and outsourced distribution services  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to organic growth in our americas and africa regions  as well as the impact of our acquisitions of concentrek and maertens in the fiscal we expect our other net revenue to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to our recent acquisition of market transport in march staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of increased resources to accommodate the increase in business activity and the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisitions of perfect logistics and concentrek in fiscal and ihd and unigistix in fiscal  which we estimated were responsible for approximately of the total increase 
additionally  we added several experienced people with strong customer relationships to our sales team during fiscal and we are currently still recruiting additional salespeople 
these experienced new hires are included in the staff costs for fiscal from their date of hire and will add to staff costs going forward 
furthermore  we have incurred additional staff costs due to changes made in our brazilian management team in fiscal stock compensation expense increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of restricted stock units issued to directors  officers and employees under our share based compensation plans 
this expense relating to retention based awards commenced in the later part of fiscal when they were allocated 
these awards are expensed evenly over their vesting period 
in addition  we recognized stock compensation expense in respect of performance based stock awards because it became probable in fiscal that the performance criteria would be achieved 
we expect stock compensation expense to increase to approximately million in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  as follows in the first quarter ending april  approximately million  approximately million for each of the second and third quarters and approximately million in the last quarter of fiscal we also expect staff costs to increase in fiscal due to the increase in specialized staff required for our asone key initiative  which is the migration of our operational freight forwarding systems into a single operating platform and which will eventually encompass all of our operational systems 
total staff costs expressed as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal over fiscal primarily due to capital spending during fiscal  along with the impact of our acquisitions  and to a lesser degree  the impact of exchange rates as compared to the generally weakening us dollar during fiscal as compared to fiscal amortization of intangible assets expenses is expected to increase in fiscal our recent acquisition of market transport  in march  is expected to increase amortization of intangible assets expenses by approximately million in fiscal from fiscal  based on our preliminary purchase price allocation 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal these expenses increased primarily because of the increased costs associated with the higher volumes and organic growth experienced by the company and secondarily from the additional operating costs incurred by our acquisitions which we made during fiscal as well as the ihd and unigistix acquisitions 
approximately million of the increase was due to the impact of our acquisitions 
included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for fiscal  representing an increase of 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations  including locations acquired with our acquisitions  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs increased to million compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the increased level of business activity  and  to a lesser degree  the impact of our acquisitions  including ihd and unigistix 
as we manage our business  we continue to focus on our other operating expense line items 
in this regard  we set ourselves specific cost budgets and manage to these budgets by seeking to limit or even possibly reduce expenditures where possible in specific line items to offset both planned and unplanned increases in others 
for example  the increases in fiscal in other operating expenses described above were partially offset by reducing  when compared to fiscal  our provision for bad debts as a result of our bad debt experience and continued improvement in our accounts receivable management 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to our efforts in holding increases in operating costs to a lower rate of growth than our growth in net revenues 
in our experience  our contract logistics operations typically incur a lower ratio of other operating expenses compared to net revenues than our other service lines  and if this service line increases as a percentage of our aggregate net revenues  we currently anticipate that other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net revenues to decrease 
our interest income relates primarily to interest earned on our cash deposits  while our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
interest income and interest expense increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
our interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates 
our interest expense increased primarily due to higher levels of borrowings and higher interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal resulting from cash being used for our acquisitions made during the current fiscal year  as well as the earn out payment made in our second quarter of fiscal for sli  and to an increase in our capital lease obligations in fiscal versus fiscal we anticipate our interest income to decrease in fiscal due to our expected utilization of our cash resources primarily in respect of contingent earn out payments and our recent acquisition of market transport 
we also expect our interest expense to increase in fiscal due to the interest expense associated with the addition of a new million senior  secured term loan credit facility we obtained in connection with our recent acquisition of market transport in march we are seeking to replace the million senior  secured term loan credit facility with an alternative long term debt financing of up to million  which we expect to further increase our interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal our effective income tax rate of in fiscal was higher than the effective income tax rate of in the prior year 
our overall effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic composition of our worldwide earnings and in fiscal  we had a higher proportion of taxable income generated in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than in fiscal 
table of contents minority interests increased  causing net income to decrease  by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the minority interests in the income of our south african operations which arose in december when those operations were reorganized 
we expect this trend to continue into fiscal net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal overall  our net revenue benefited from organic growth from all our operations  from the impact of acquisitions made during fiscal as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
on a constant currency basis when we translate our fiscal results using currency exchange rates in effect for fiscal  we estimate that acquisitions and favorable exchange rates accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 
airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from organic growth in all regions and favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal  mostly in our africa and europe regions  due to changes in the south african rand and the euro  respectively  compared to the us dollar 
airfreight volumes increased in all regions  although the benefit of this increase was offset by the higher carrier costs  resulting in lower airfreight yields overall in fiscal when compared to fiscal we experienced our highest volume growth for fiscal in asia and africa 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased volumes in fiscal versus fiscal especially in the africa and asia pacific regions  which offset our decline in yields caused by price increases from ocean carriers which were typically passed through to customers at lower margins than we have historically experienced 
customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of the higher shipping volumes resulting from increased demand for our airfreight and ocean freight services 
contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
we estimate that approximately of this increase for fiscal was due to the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix during fiscal other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services including outsourced distribution services  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to organic growth particularly in the americas and africa regions  as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year 
staff costs were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of increased resources to accommodate the increase in business activity  an increase in reported staff costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year and the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisitions of ihd and unigistix  which we estimated accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
total staff costs expressed as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease when expressed as a percentage of net revenues was primarily related to an increase in these costs at a slower rate of growth than the increase in net revenue 
staff costs are the largest component of operating expenses and we strive to manage these costs in relation to net revenue growth 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for fiscal over fiscal to million primarily due to increases in capital spending for computer equipment and fixtures and fittings during the period  along with the impact of fiscal business acquisitions and the full year impact of fiscal business acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to of net revenue in fiscal as compared to in the prior year when expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal generally these expenses increased because of the increased costs associated with the higher volumes and organic growth experienced by the company  as well as an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions in fiscal over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
in addition  operating costs as a result of the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix  accounted for approximately million of the total increase in other operating expenses in fiscal included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for the prior fiscal year 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  including those acquired with ihd and unigistix 
the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs were million compared to million for the same prior year period 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the increased level of business activity  the increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
in addition the acquisitions of ihd and unigistix during the year increased other operating expenses estimated to be million 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal our interest income relates primarily to interest earned on our cash deposits  while our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
both interest income and interest expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million  or  and million  or  respectively  due to the cash used in our acquisitions and the additional working capital requirements for the increase in business activity during fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a change in the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income when compared to the prior year 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  representing an increase of million from january   as a result of generating a net amount of million of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities offset by a negative impact of million related to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on our cash balances 
historically  we have used our internally generated net cash flow from operating activities along with the net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
in fiscal  we generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities 
this resulted from net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets totaling million and other items totaling million  plus an increase in trade payables and other current liabilities of million which was offset by an increase in trade receivables and other current assets of million 
the increases in trade receivables and other current assets and trade payables and other current liabilities of fiscal were primarily due to increased levels of business in all of our geographic regions during fiscal as compared to the comparable prior year period 

table of contents during fiscal  cash used for capital expenditures was approximately million  consisting primarily of computer hardware and software and furniture  fixtures and fittings 
based on our current operations  we expect our capital expenditures to grow in line with an increase in our business operations for fiscal during fiscal  we used an aggregate of million of cash for acquisitions and contingent earn out payments  including million and million  net of cash acquired  for our acquisitions of perfect logistics and concentrek  respectively 
approximately million of cash was used for the cash portion of the earn out payment made in connection with our acquisition of sli and approximately million for the first of two earn out payments and a working capital adjustment made in connection with our acquisition of unigistix 
future earn out payment calculations may result in a significant use of cash 
in the case of our acquisition of sli  where the acquisition agreement requires the earn out payment to be made in the form of ordinary shares at a deemed price of per ordinary share  the sellers have accepted cash payments or a combination of cash and ordinary shares in the past and we expect that they will accept a cash payment or a combination of cash and ordinary shares for the final earn out payment  which  based on year to date results and the current share price of our ordinary shares  we expect could be in the range of million to million 
future earn out payments include the remaining contingent earn out payment related to our acquisition of sli  which is scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal and three remaining contingent earn out payments related to our acquisition of et logistics which will be calculated based on the future performance of the acquired operation for each of the fiscal years in the three year period ending january  there are no contractual limits on the amounts that may be payable under the contingent earn out payment terms for sli or et logistics as they are contingent on the earnings of each of the acquired businesses  however  we anticipate that the contingent cash earn out payments would generally be funded from a combination of our current cash balances  cash generated from future operations and future debt financing 
our one remaining contingent earn out payment related to our acquisition of unigistix is to be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for the twelve month period ending october  and which is subject to a maximum of approximately million canadian dollars equivalent to approximately million as of january   calculated after the first payment of approximately million made in december our acquisition of perfect logistics contains four earn out payments which will be based on the acquired operation s future earnings over each of the four twelve month periods in the period ending may  and which are subject to a cumulative maximum us dollar equivalent of approximately million 
in addition  we anticipate making four contingent earn out payments  totaling at least million and subject to a maximum of million  related to our acquisition of concentrek which will be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for each of the four twelve month periods in the period ending january  and four contingent earn out payments related to our acquisition of logica which will be calculated based on a multiple of the acquired operation s future earnings for each of the four twelve month periods in the period ending january  and which are subject to a maximum of million euros equivalent to approximately million as of january  and offset against the initial purchase price 
our financing activities during fiscal provided million of cash  primarily due to net increased long term borrowings of million  which related primarily to our purchase of perfect logistics  plus million of net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares resulting from the exercise of stock options granted to employees and directors  partially offset by dividends paid during the period of million and repayments of capital lease obligations totaling million 
we expect to use approximately million of cash in the second quarter of fiscal for the payment of dividends on our ordinary shares as declared by our board of directors on march  in march  we completed the acquisition of market transport for million in cash 
the acquisition was funded by a combination of our cash reserves and the proceeds from a new million senior secured six month term credit facility with lasalle bank national association  which we refer to as lasalle  as agent  and various other lenders 
additional information regarding this million senior secured six month term credit facility is discussed in this item under credit facilities 

table of contents credit facilities we have various credit and guarantee facilities established in countries where such facilities are required for our business 
at january   these facilities totaled million and provided for borrowing capacities from approximately million to million totaling million  and also provided for guarantees  which are a necessary part of our business  totaling million 
our outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled million at january  and we had approximately million of available  unused borrowing capacity under these facilities 
certain of these credit facilities have financial covenants  with which the company was in compliance as of january  due to the global nature of our business  we utilize a number of different financial institutions to provide these various facilities 
consequently  the use of a particular credit facility is normally restricted to the country in which it originated and a particular credit facility may restrict distributions by the subsidiary operating in the country 
most of our borrowings are secured by grants of security interests in accounts receivable and other assets  including pledges of stock of our subsidiaries 
the interest rates on these facilities vary and ranged from to at january  these rates are generally linked to the prime lending rate in each country where we have facilities 
we use our credit facilities to primarily fund our working capital needs as well as to provide for customs bonds and guarantees and forward exchange transactions 
the customs bonds and guarantees relate primarily to our obligations for credit that is extended to us in the ordinary course of business by direct carriers  primarily airlines  and for duty and tax deferrals granted by governmental entities responsible for the collection of customs duties and value added taxes 
the total underlying amounts that are due and payable by us for transportation costs and governmental excises are recorded as liabilities in our financial statements 
therefore  no additional liabilities have been recorded for these guarantees in the unlikely event that the guarantor company was to be required to perform as those liabilities would be duplicative 
while the majority of our borrowings are due and payable within one year  we believe we should be able to renew such facilities on commercially reasonable terms 
our largest credit facility as of january  was a senior revolving credit facility agreement with nedbank in south africa nedbank sa  which provides for an aggregate credit facility of million south african rands equivalent to approximately million as of january  
of this facility  approximately million is available for overdrafts  million is available for guarantees and standby letters of credit  million is available for capital leases and million is available for foreign exchange contracts 
as with our nedbank limited facility in the united kingdom nedbank uk discussed below and with other facilities we have had with nedbank in the past  this facility is available on an ongoing basis until further notice  subject to nedbank sa s credit review procedures and may be terminated by the bank at any time 
in the event this credit facility is terminated by the bank  we would be required to seek replacement financing which could involve selling equity securities or incurring debt from another lender which may not be on terms as advantageous as those we obtained from nedbank sa 
the facility is secured by cross guarantees and indemnities of selected subsidiary companies 
our second largest credit facility as of january  was a senior revolving syndicated credit facility agreement between certain of our subsidiaries in the united states and lasalle  as agent  and various other lenders  which provides for up to million of borrowings based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable primarily for use in our operations in the united states 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of our us subsidiaries  excluding market transport and concentrek  as well as a pledge of the stock of the us subsidiaries  excluding market transport and concentrek 
this credit facility matures in august and contains financial and other covenants and restrictions applicable to our us operations  excluding market transport and concentrek  and a change of control provision applicable to changes at the us holding company level 
this agreement limits the right of the affected us operating company to distribute funds to holding companies 
as of january   we also had a credit facility with nedbank uk  totaling million 
we entered into this credit facility in september as a replacement for our prior credit facility with nedbank uk which was denominated in british pounds sterling 
this facility is primarily used for guarantees and standby letters of credit to secure banking facilities and for guaranteeing performance undertakings of our 
table of contents subsidiary companies with million available for foreign exchange contracts 
aggregate borrowing availability under this credit facility includes a revolving short term loan of up to million 
the facility is available on an ongoing basis until further notice  subject to nedbank uk s credit review procedures and may be terminated by the bank at any time 
in the event this credit facility is terminated by the bank  we would be required to seek replacement financing which could involve selling equity securities or incurring debt from another lender which may not be on terms as advantageous as those we obtained from nedbank uk 
the facility is secured by cross guarantees and indemnities of selected subsidiary companies 
effective march   we entered into a new million senior  secured term loan credit facility  which we refer to as the bridge facility 
this credit facility matures on september  and contains financial and other covenants 
the bridge facility is with a syndication of various financial institutions with lasalle as administrative agent for the lenders 
we entered into the bridge facility to provide short term financing for our acquisition of market transport 
the bridge facility is secured by a pledge of all the shares of market transport and each of its subsidiaries 
our obligations under the bridge facility are guaranteed by us and selected subsidiaries 
at our election  amounts outstanding under the bridge facility bear interest at i the greater of lasalle s prime rate or the overnight federal funds rate plus  or ii libor plus 
to repay the bridge facility  we are seeking replacement alternative long term debt financing of up to million 
in addition  we are also commencing the process of proceeding with a new million worldwide revolving credit facility which  if completed  will replace substantially all our other existing credit facilities 
in  we filed a prospectus as part of a registration statement on form s with the sec  using a shelf registration process 
under this shelf process  we may sell from time to time any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate dollar amount of proceeds of million 
the securities described in the prospectus include  ordinary shares  class a preferred stock  class b preferred stock  debt securities  warrants to purchase ordinary shares  warrants to purchase class a preferred stock and warrants to purchase class b preferred stock 
each time we sell securities  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes  which may include repayment of indebtedness  working capital and potential business acquisitions  including potential earn out payments related to acquisitions 
contractual obligations at january   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years bank and other long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total includes estimated interest expense based on the variable interest rates on these obligations 
includes interest expense due to the fixed nature of interest rates on these obligations 
the amounts in the above table do not include the million outstanding under the bridge facility  which we entered into in march the bridge facility matures on september  
table of contents we believe that with our current cash position  various bank credit facilities  operating cash flows  and the replacement alternative long term debt financing and new revolving credit facility which we currently anticipate will be available to us  we have sufficient means to meet our working capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future as our operations are currently conducted 
the nature of our operations necessitates dealing in many foreign currencies and our results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease obligations  which are included in the preceding contractual obligations table  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation to date  our business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation 
historically  we have been generally successful in passing carrier rate increases and surcharges on to our customers by means of price increases and surcharges 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term 
due to the high degree of competition in the marketplace  these rate increases might lead to an erosion of our profit margins 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion of our operating and financial review and prospects is based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with us gaap and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in  or affecting  our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable and various other recorded and disclosed amounts 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our significant accounting polices are included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements included in this report  however  we believe that certain accounting policies are more critical to our financial statement preparation process than others 
these include our policies on revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  contingencies and currency translation 
revenue recognition gross revenue represents billings on exports to customers  plus net revenue on imports  net of any billings for value added taxes  custom duties and freight insurance premiums whereby we act as an agent 
gross revenue and freight consolidation costs for airfreight and ocean freight forwarding services  including commissions earned from our services as an authorized agent for airline and ocean carriers and third party freight insurers  are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin which is when the customer is billed 
gross customs brokerage revenue  contract logistics revenue and other revenue are recognized when we bill the customer  which for customs brokerage revenue is when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed  and for contract logistics and other revenue is when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business 
net revenue is determined by deducting freight consolidation costs from gross revenue 
freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 
certain costs  related primarily to ancillary services  are estimated and accrued at the time the services are provided  and adjusted upon receipt of the suppliers final invoices 

table of contents income taxes our overall effective income tax rate is determined by the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income  with some of our operations in countries with low effective income tax rates 
consequently our provision of tax expense on an interim basis is based on an estimate of our overall effective tax rate for the related annual period 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable income 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences 
deferred income taxes are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled 
deferred income taxes are charged or credited to the income statement 
deferred income tax assets are offset by valuation allowances so that the assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable income will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized 
we consider our historical performance  forecast taxable income and other factors when we determine the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to determine future taxable income to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on a variety of factors and estimates 
these factors include historical customer trends  general and specific economic conditions and local market conditions 
we believe our estimate for doubtful receivables is based on reasonable assumptions and estimates  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is the difference between the purchase price of a company and the fair market value of the acquired company s net assets 
other intangible assets  with either indefinite or definite lives  include customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements 
intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated lives  which currently ranges from one to seventeen years 
other intangible assets with indefinite lives  including goodwill are assessed at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we complete the required impairment test annually in the second quarter  or when certain events occur or circumstances change 
contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
where the company is self insured in relation to freight related exposures or employee benefits  adequate liabilities are estimated and recorded for the portion we are self insured 
when estimates of our exposure from claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
currency translation for consolidation purposes  balance sheets of subsidiaries expressed in currencies other than us dollars are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
operating results for the fiscal year are translated using average rates of exchange for the fiscal year 
gains and losses on translation are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in other comprehensive income or loss 
transactions in foreign 
table of contents currencies during the year are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions 
these gains and losses arising on remeasurement are accounted for in the income statement 
exchange differences arising on the translation of long term structural loans to subsidiary companies are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date of the company s subsidiaries expressed in currencies different to their functional currencies  are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
the financial statements of foreign entities that report in the currency of a hyper inflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit currency at the balance sheet date before they are translated into us dollars 
stock split on march   our board of directors declared a three for one stock split of our ordinary shares 
shareholders of record as of the close of business on march  received two additional shares for each one share held on the record date with distribution of the additional shares effected on march  share  per share  stock option and restricted stock unit data for all periods presented in this report on form k  including the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been adjusted to give effect to the stock split

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative information about market risk foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to forward foreign exchange contracts 
at january   the notional value of all of our open forward foreign exchange contracts was million related to transactions denominated in various currencies  but predominantly in us dollars  euros and british 
table of contents pounds sterling 
these contracts are generally entered into at the time the foreign currency exposure is incurred and do not exceed days 
the following tables provide comparable information about our non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and present such information in us dollar equivalents at january  and these tables summarize information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed in foreign currency is then subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency 
non functional currency exposure in us dollar equivalents is as follows in thousands foreign exchange gain loss if functional currency net exposure appreciates depreciates assets liabilities long short by by at january  us dollars euros british pounds sterling hong kong dollars other total at january  us dollars euros british pounds sterling hong kong dollars other total qualitative information about market risk foreign exchange risk the nature of our operations necessitates dealing in many foreign currencies 
our results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  africa  asia pacific and europe 
our short term exposures to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through our use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles all of our intercompany trading obligations once per month 
in addition  selected exposures are managed by financial market transactions in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities at the end of the month following the purchase of the contract 
forward foreign exchange contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of our principal markets 
we will normally generate foreign exchange gains and losses through normal trading operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated net income 

table of contents many of our operations operate in functional currencies other than in us dollar 
the net assets of these divisions are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized losses of  in fiscal the company has historically not attempted to hedge this equity risk 
interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing and leasing activities  our operating results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  which we manage primarily through our regular financing activities 
we have short term and long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
sort term debt is primarily comprised of bank lines of credit used to finance working capital requirements and the current portion of long term debt maturing within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
generally  our short term debt is at variable interest rates  while our long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
market rate risk the fair value of our long term bank loans approximates the carrying value at january  and market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates and was not considered material at either year end
