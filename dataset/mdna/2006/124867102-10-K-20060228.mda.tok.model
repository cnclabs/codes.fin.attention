the securities the company purchased are all of an investment grade rating of triple a 
because of the rating of the securities purchased  the company believes that there is very little risk with regard to the investments since  although they are all classified as available for sale securities  the company could hold them all to maturity and realize their full value

inventory  seasonality  inflation and general economic factors the company attempts to keep its inventory for every product at levels that will enable shipment against orders within a three week period 
however  certain components must be inventoried well in advance of actual orders because of time to acquire circumstances 
for the most part  purchases are based upon projected quarterly requirements  which are projected based upon sales indications received by the sales and marketing departments  and general business factors 
all of the company s contract manufacture products and components are purchased from non affiliated entities 
warehousing is provided at company facilities  and all products are shipped from the company s warehouse facilities

we continue to evaluate our sales staff and to try to attract aggressive salespeople to increase the distribution of our current product line 
we are also continuing to look for additional businesses or product lines which we think will help the company to grow and are also reviewing possible acquisitions or any other offers which we feel will enhance shareholders value 
because our products are sold to retail stores throughout the united states and  in small part  abroad  sales are particularly affected by general economic conditions 
accordingly  any adverse change in the economic climate can have an adverse impact on the company s sales and financial condition 
the company does not believe that inflation or other general economic circumstance that would negatively affect operations can be predicted at present  but if such circumstances should occur  they could have material and negative impact on the company s net sales and revenues  unless the company was able to pass along related cost increases to its customers 
there was no significant impact on operations as a result of inflation during the current fiscal year
