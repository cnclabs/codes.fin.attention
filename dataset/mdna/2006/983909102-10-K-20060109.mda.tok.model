item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal we continued our strategies of rebalancing our sales efforts to support both the avaya and nortel product lines and to expand our services business 
to execute this strategy  we continued to invest heavily in our sales department and technical forces 
over the past two years  we have increased our sales expenses to hire new personnel with experience selling nortel products and to increase sales management to provide more accountability for revenue production 
similarly  in the services area we have acquired more technical expertise to support our nortel service initiatives and to support certain geographical areas 
these investments have been made with our long term future in mind as we believe that it is important to quickly establish ourselves as a leading provider of enterprise class communications solutions while this market continues to develop 
these investments  coupled with flat revenues  reduced vendor incentives  and increased amortization and support costs associated with our technology infrastructure  produced lower income from operations in fiscal however  we believe we are on the right course to produce above market  sustainable and profitable revenue growth in the future 
in july greg forrest was named president and chief operating officer of the company 
jack ingram remains chairman and chief executive officer 
since mr 
forrest s appointment  the company has focused heavily on revenue growth by establishing new structures and processes to support our existing sales organization and enable organic growth 
additionally  we have focused on selling services 
this initiative  which is part of our managed services line of business  began to produce revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter and will continue to be a major emphasis in fiscal as part of the managed services initiative  we have begun to earn services revenues from major nortel customers who need a nationwide vendor to provide on site assistance for non telephony communications  networking  and other technology related projects 
by positioning the company as on site hands and eyes for these large customers  we are able to expand the range of services we can perform for them beyond telephony 
typically  these additional services  such as checking or upgrading security systems  fax machines  and networking components are performed at the direction of the customer s in house technical experts and may not require specific technical education beyond a basic understanding of wiring and technology 
we continue to be very optimistic about our long term prospects 
ip based communications systems continue to gain market acceptance  the market for software applications to run on these systems is rapidly developing  and we believe we are well positioned in this market to be successful 
in addition to selling products and related software applications  we believe our services business will continue to grow more rapidly than will our systems sales 
we believe the initiatives discussed above represent substantial opportunities for new services growth independent of the growth in services that naturally follows from sales of systems to customers 
the discussion that follows provides more details regarding the factors and trends which affected our financial results  liquidity  and capital resources in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these results include sales of systems to commercial customers of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and sales of systems to hospitality customers of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in sales of systems to commercial customers reflects the fewer number of large projects we received in fiscal compared to the prior year 
most of these larger projects were recognized as revenues in the first quarter of fiscal and of the decline in systems sales to commercial customers occurred in that quarter 
in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  our systems sales to commercial customers had recovered to fourth quarter fiscal levels  reflecting both improved sales of avaya systems and increased traction in our nortel systems sales initiatives 
the improvement in year over year sales of systems to lodging customers reflects improved financial conditions in that vertical market and significantly increased new construction activity by our largest customer in that segment 
based upon the improvements we began to see in the fourth fiscal quarter  we believe that our sales of nortel systems will continue to improve in fiscal also  at the end of fiscal we expanded our avaya sales force to resume expansion of that product line as well 
services 
revenues earned from service related activities were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase consisted of increases in revenues from services provided by both the nsc and our installation department 
the revenues earned by the nsc reflect higher sales of t m services as discussed above  as well as higher revenues earned from cabling services sold during the year 
as part of our acquisition of bluejack in fiscal  we launched a national cabling initiative to increase the market awareness of our capabilities in this area 
these efforts were very successful and increases in cabling revenues represented approximately of the total increase in services revenues in fiscal the other major component of our nsc revenues is our maintenance contract base 
revenues earned from maintenance contracts represented approximately of total services revenues and was relatively unchanged from the previous year 
despite experiencing lower sales of systems during fiscal  our installation services revenues were flat during the year 
this was due to an installation contract we received at the beginning of the fiscal year to install a series of systems for the metropolitan transit authority of atlanta marta and due to improved sales of systems to lodging customers 
under the marta contract  we were engaged as a subcontractor to perform a series of installations of equipment upgrades to the marta communications network and provide training at the various upgrade locations 
the majority of the services revenues from the marta project were recorded during the second quarter 
there were no equipment revenues recorded by us under this contract as another dealer won that portion of the marta contract 
as such  the marta contract represents an example of how we are positioning the services segment of our business to be less dependent on systems sales revenues to generate revenue growth 
we believe that there is a substantial market available to earn revenues from installation related activities unrelated to sales of systems to our customers 
most of these installation opportunities would likely be nortel related products 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal and in fiscal gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this point increase in gross margins on systems sales was achieved through careful focus and controls around contract acceptance and margin reviews and a mix of fewer large  low margin projects 
these factors more than offset the continued tightening of cost of goods sold rebate programs by our major vendors  primarily avaya 
in fiscal these programs  in which we receive rebates against our cost of goods sold for selling specific products  represented points of margin improvement on systems sales 
in fiscal  these rebates represented only points of margin enhancement  a decrease 
we believe that despite a highly competitive market  we can hold our gross margins on systems sales relatively stable  subject to various mix factors 
however  we can give no assurance regarding possible changes in the cost of goods sold rebate programs that could either improve or further erode our margins 
the gross margins earned on services revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease reflects i our continued investment in hiring and training technical personnel for our nortel initiative  ii higher materials costs to support our installed base of customers under maintenance contracts  and iii a higher usage of third party service providers to support some of our managed services initiative 
we are continuing to build up our technical competencies to install and support the products we sell 
this includes hiring some new technical personnel  replacing some existing personnel with higher priced certified staff  and additional training of existing staff 
in addition to selling the nortel product line  we also are working to become more proficient in contact management  unified messaging  and networking applications 
we are also continuing to evaluate the geographic locations of our technical staff and have made reductions in some areas to be able to hire new or additional technical staff in other areas 
in most of those instances  we hire experienced and certified technicians which has led to a slightly higher cost structure 
additionally  our materials costs were higher to support equipment under customer service contracts in fiscal than in previous years 
in particular  in the fourth fiscal quarter of we experienced a string of equipment failures which were covered under our maintenance contracts 
we have no reason to believe this trend will continue into the future 
finally  we service most of our customer locations through the use of xeta employed service technicians 
however  to serve remote locations and to maintain an efficient cost structure  we also utilize third party technical vendors to perform some services for us on a subcontractor basis 
these costs were higher than expected and our service management is reviewing our procedures and staffing plans to more effectively manage the balance between internal and external labor requirements in fiscal as a result of growth initiatives in the services area and more effective use of internal personnel  we expect services gross margins to improve in fiscal a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
other revenues represent commissions earned on the sale of manufacturer service contracts and sales and cost of goods sold on equipment outside our normal provisioning processes 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of our material logistics and purchasing functions 
corporate cost of goods sold declined in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this increase in operating expenses includes our investment in sales resources to support the nortel product line initiative of approximately  increased corporate expenses of approximately  related to increases in insurance costs  auditing and legal expenses  and the addition and relocation of a senior executive  reduced marketing incentive payments from our major vendors of  and increased expenses related to our oracle implementation project of  most of the increase in the oracle upgrade project represented an increase in non cash amortization expense of  interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by approximately  reflecting lower average debt levels in fiscal also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other income of approximately  last year 
the primary reason for the change in other income and expense relates to a  reversal of a legal contingency in there was no such unusual item of that magnitude in the current year and the legal matter in question was settled in for the amount remaining in the accrual 
tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this decrease reflects slightly lower revenues and the increases in operating expenses discussed above 
our current business model targets an operating margin of 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  both commercial systems revenues and service revenues  and improve the gross margins in our services business to reach this target 
year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
these results reflect improved market conditions while the overall us economy showed signs of improvement  we continued to see mixed results as technology spending  especially on communications equipment  remained sluggish  and the addition of the nortel product line in fiscal market acceptance of ip based telephony and related technologies improved during the year and nearly all new systems sold were either hybrid or ip based systems 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities were million for fiscal  a increase over fiscal all of our major service revenue streams showed increases in fiscal over fiscal these increases included increases in installation and consulting revenues that were driven by increases in systems sales and increases in revenues from maintenance contracts and services that were driven primarily by the addition of the nortel product line 
the increase in systems sales in fiscal resulted in improved installation  project management and programming revenues  all of which were directly associated with new systems sales 
our revenues earned from maintenance contracts increased overall  but were mainly fueled by a increase in revenues earned from service contracts with commercial non lodging customers 
this increase was directly related to the addition of the nortel product line to our business 
we also enjoyed a increase in revenues earned from move  add  and change mac and t m service activities 
a portion of these revenues were earned from customers who did not have service contracts  but called us regularly for services 
the remaining portion of mac and t m revenues were earned from customers who did have service contracts with us  but needed non covered services performed 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal while we experienced a decline in gross margins on both systems sales and services  most of the decline in gross margins  percentage points  was related to the gross margins on systems sales 
gross margins on systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins we earned on systems sales were volatile and were affected by several factors including product mix  sales to some customers who had pre negotiated contracts with avaya  which resulted in lower margins for us  and  variety and changes in our suppliers and manufacturers financial incentives to their distributors 
approximately percentage points of the gross margin decline was expected as a result of dropping our exclusive representation of avaya products to the commercial sector and adding the nortel product line 
the decrease in gross margins earned on systems sales occurred mostly during our first fiscal quarter and then was relatively stable the remainder of the year 
the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was directly related to the cost of starting up our service offering for the nortel product line 
a final component to our gross margins the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting management s continued focus on containment of administrative costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of sales reflects continued focus on controlling administrative costs and an increase in the sales and marketing incentive payments received from manufacturers 
interest and other income 
interest expense declined in fiscal by approximately  reflecting lower average debt levels in fiscal also  during fiscal we capitalized interest costs of approximately  related to our oracle implementation project compared to approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our term debt by million through cash on hand and funds generated from operations 
net other income in fiscal was approximately  compared to net other expense of approximately  in fiscal the primary reason for the change in other income and expense related to the accrual of a contingent liability in and the partial reversal of that contingency in as more facts about the matter became available 
tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of approximately in all years presented 
this rate reflected the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to in this decrease reflected lower gross margins earned in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our financial condition improved during fiscal as our working capital grew by  our total assets grew by  and our term debt was reduced by 
these improvements were the result of the million in cash flows generated by operations 
these cash flows included cash from earnings and non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of million 
other changes in our working capital accounts netted to zero  but included increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  both reflecting the growth in our revenues during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
these changes were offset by a million increase in accounts payable during the year  also reflecting the increased purchasing activity in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we used these cash flows to fund capital expenditures of  and to reduce debt by  approximately one half of our capital expenditures were focused on supporting our nortel growth initiatives such as acquiring vans for our new branch model operations and acquiring and upgrading computer hardware to support growth in personnel 
the remaining capital expenditures were made to support our oracle implementation project 
at october  we had capitalized million in this project 
we have segregated the cost of this asset into four groups with estimated useful lives of three  five  seven and ten years 
in fiscal we began amortizing the cost of those portions of the system that were ready for use 
our operating results for fiscal include  in amortization expense related to the project 
at october  the balance on our working capital revolver was million  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
we believe that this available capacity is sufficient for our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver is scheduled to expire on september   however we expect to renew it for another month period prior to its expiration 
at october   we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements and we consider our relationship with our bank to be good 
in addition to the available capacity under our working capital line of credit  we believe we have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity 
however  there are currently no plans to issue such securities 
the table below presents our contractual obligations at october  as well as payment obligations over the next five fiscal years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
sfas no 
amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  apb no 
that was issued in the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  apb required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the company adopted sfas no 
in the third quarter of fiscal there was no impact to the company s operating results or financial condition as a result of the adoption of the standard 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the us these accounting principles require us to exercise significant judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our previous judgments had predicted 
therefore  the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once those actual events are known 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment based on shipment of the equipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity and customer acceptance  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables that we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal   and we conduct an annual goodwill impairment review on november of each year for the previous year just ended october to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in fiscal years and  we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist us in this review 
in order to make this assessment each year  we prepared a long term forecast of the operating results and cash flows associated with the major reporting units of our business 
we prepared this forecast to determine the net discounted cash flows associated with each of these units 
the value of the discounted cash flows  less bank debt  was then compared to the book value of each of those units 
there is a great deal of judgment involved in making this assessment  including the growth rates of our various business lines  gross margins  operating margins  discount rates  and the capital expenditures needed to support the projected growth in revenues 
in those years in which a valuation consultant was engaged to assist in this evaluation  additional data regarding competitors and market valuations was also examined 
this examination also requires a great amount of subjectivity and assumptions 
based on the work performed  we determined that the fair value was greater than our carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products assembled or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
in addition  from time to time we are a party to threatened litigation or actual litigation in the normal course of business 
in such cases  we evaluate our potential liability  if any  and determine if an estimate of that liability should be recorded in our financial statements 
estimating both the probability of our liability and the potential amount of the liability are highly subjective exercises and are evaluated frequently as the underlying circumstances change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate libor at october  plus to depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio or the bank s prime rate at october  less to also depending on the company s funded debt to cash flow ratio 
in an effort to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates  in november we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate interest payments on amortizing notional amounts of million 
the swap agreement expired on november  and was not renewed 
the pay fixed rates under the swap agreement was 
the receive floating rates for the swap agreement was month libor  resetting monthly 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
