our allowance for losses on loans may be insufficient to cover actual losses on loans 
we maintain an allowance for losses on loans at a level believed adequate by us to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is a reserve established through a provision for losses on loans charged to expense that represents our estimate of probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio at each statement of condition date and is based on the review of available and relevant information 
the level of the allowance for losses on loans reflects our consideration of historical charge offs and recoveries  levels of and trends in delinquencies  impaired loans and other classified loans  concentrations of credit within the commercial loan portfolio  volume and type of lending  and current and anticipated economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for losses on loans inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for losses on loans 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for losses on loans and may require an increase in the provision for losses on loans or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different from ours 
also  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for losses on loans  we will need additional provisions to increase our allowance for losses on loans 
any increases in the allowance for losses on loans will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for losses on loans see critical accounting policies and allowance for losses on loans within item management s discussion and analysis of financial results and operations of this annual report on form k 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area with other financial institutions offering products and services similar to those we offer 
we compete with savings associations  national banks  regional banks and other community banks in making loans  attracting deposits and recruiting and retaining talented employees 
we also compete with securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market mutual funds  credit unions and other non bank financial service providers 
many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions we are subject to and therefore are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services 
the competition in our market for making commercial and construction loans has resulted in more competitive pricing and credit structure as well as intense competition for skilled commercial lending officers 
these trends could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable 
significant discounting of interest rates offered on loans negatively impacts interest income and can therefore adversely impact net interest income 
if increased competition causes us to modify our underwriting standards  we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities 
an inability to recruit and retain skilled commercial lending officers poses a significant barrier to retaining and growing our customer base 
the competition in our market for attracting deposits also has resulted in more competitive pricing 
to successfully compete in our market area  we have at times offered higher deposit rates within the same market area 
increasing rates paid on deposits in response to competitive pressure could decrease our net interest margin 
while management believes it can and does successfully compete with other financial institutions in our market  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size and lack of geographic diversification 
the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger public companies which can cause price volatility 
the trading history of our common stock has been characterized by relatively low trading volume 
the value of a shareholder s investment may be subject to sudden decreases due to the volatility of the price of our common stock which trades on the nasdaq national market 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuation in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our market  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting us or our competitors 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent a shareholder from selling common stock at or above the current market price 
we may experience difficulties in managing our growth  and our growth strategy involves risks that may negatively impact our net income 
we may expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current market and in surrounding areas by opening new branches and acquiring existing branches of other financial institutions 
to the extent that we undertake additional branch openings and acquisitions  we are likely to continue to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations  which may have an adverse effect on our levels of reported net income  return on average equity and return on average assets 
other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our time and attention and general disruption to our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our operations 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with law  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
