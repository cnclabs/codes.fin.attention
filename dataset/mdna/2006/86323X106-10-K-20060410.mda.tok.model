part i item business general lanvision systems  inc lanvision tm or the company is a healthcare information technology company doing business as streamline health tm  which is focused on developing and licensing proprietary software solutions that improve document centric information flows and complement and enhance existing transaction centric hospital healthcare information systems 
the company s workflow and document management solutions bridge the gap between current  predominantly paper based processes and transaction based healthcare information systems by electronically capturing document centric information from disparate sources  electronically directing that information through vital business processes  and providing access to the information to authenticated users such as physicians  nurses  administrative and financial personnel and payers across the continuum of care 
lanvision s systems are designed for enterprise wide deployment to seamlessly connect disparate departmental systems  or silos of independent technologies which create friction points tm  in a common interoperable document management workflow solution 
the company s workflow based products and services offer solutions to specific healthcare business processes within the revenue cycle  such as remote coding  abstracting and chart completion  remote physician order processing  pre admission registration scanning  insurance verification  denial management  secondary billing services  explanation of benefits processing  release of information processing and other departmental workflow processes 
lanvision s products and services also create an integrated document centric repository of historical health information that is complementary to  and can be seamlessly bolted on to existing transaction centric clinical  financial and management information systems  allowing healthcare providers to aggressively move toward fully electronic medical record emr processes while improving service levels and convenience for all stakeholders 
these integrated systems allow providers and administrators to dramatically improve the availability of patient information while decreasing direct costs associated with document retrieval  work in process  chart completion  document retention and archiving 
lanvision s software solutions can be provided on a subscription basis via remote application hosting services or licensed and installed locally 
lanvision provides aspen sm  application service provider based remote hosting 
table of contents services to  the university hospital  a member of the health alliance of greater cincinnati  md anderson cancer center  and children s medical center of columbus  oh  among others 
in addition  lanvision has licensed its workflow and document management solutions  which are installed at leading healthcare providers including stanford hospital and clinics  the albert einstein healthcare network  beth israel medical centers  the university of pittsburgh medical center  medical university hospital authority of south carolina  and memorial sloan kettering cancer center  among others 
lanvision s applications allow authenticated users  such as physicians  nurses  administrative and financial personnel  and payers with access to patient healthcare information that exists in disparate systems across the continuum of care and improve operational efficiencies through business process re engineering and automating labor intensive and demanding paper environments 
lanvision s applications and services are complementary to existing clinical and financial systems  and use document imaging and advanced workflow tools to ensure users can electronically access both structured transaction centric and unstructured document centric patient data and all the various forms of clinical and financial healthcare information from a single permanent and secure repository  including clinician s handwritten notes  laboratory reports  photographs  insurance cards  etc 
lanvision s workflow solutions offer value to all of the constituents in the healthcare delivery process by enabling them to simultaneously access and utilize lanvision s advanced technological workflow applications to process information  on a real time basis from virtually any location  including the physician s desktop  using web based technology 
lanvision s solutions integrate its own proprietary imaging platform  application workflow modules and image and web enabling tools that allow for the seamless merger of back office functionality with existing clinical and financial information systems at the desktop 
lanvision offers its own document imaging management infrastructure foundation suite that is built for high volume transaction processing and is specifically designed for the healthcare industry 
in addition to providing access to information not previously available at the desktop  lanvision s applications fulfill the administrative and regulatory needs of the medical records  patient financial services and other hospital departments 
furthermore  these systems have been specifically designed to integrate with any clinical information system 
for example  lanvision has integrated its products with selected systems from siemens medical solutions usa  inc siemens  cerner corporation  and idx information systems corporation idx applications  thus enabling customers to use our solutions without the expense of replacing entire software systems to gain the software functionality 
by offering electronic access to all the patient information components of the medical record  this integration completes one of the most difficult tasks necessary to provide a true electronic medical record 
lanvision s systems deliver on line enterprisewide access to fully updated patient information  which historically was maintained on a variety of media  including paper  magnetic disk  optical disk  and microfilm 
lanvision operates in one segment as a provider of health information technology solutions that streamline healthcare information flows within a healthcare facility 
the financial information required by items b of regulation s k is contained in item selected financial information of this form k 
historically  lanvision has derived most of its revenues from systems sales  recurring application hosting services  recurring maintenance fees  and professional services involving the licensing  either directly or through remarketing partners  of its medical record workflow and revenue cycle management solutions to integrated healthcare delivery networks idn 
in a typical transaction  lanvision  or its remarketing partners  enter into a perpetual license or fee for service subscription agreement for lanvision s software application suite and may license or sell other third party software and hardware components to the idn 
additionally  lanvision provides professional services  including implementation  training  and product support 
with respect to systems sales  lanvision earns its highest margins on proprietary lanvision software and application hosting services and the lowest margins on third party hardware and software 
systems sales to customers may include different configurations of lanvision software  hardware  third party software  and professional services  resulting in varying margins among contracts 
the margins on professional services revenues fluctuate based upon the negotiated terms of the agreement with each customer and lanvision s ability to fully utilize its professional services  maintenance  and support services staff 

table of contents beginning in  lanvision began offering customers the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an application hosting basis as an application service provider asp 
lanvision established a hosting data center and installed lanvision s suite of workflow products  called aspen application service provider ehealth network within the hosting data center 
under this arrangement  customers electronically capture information and securely transmit the data to the hosting data center 
the aspen services store and manage the data using lanvision s suite of applications  and customers can view  print  fax  and process the information from anywhere using the lanvision web based applications 
lanvision charges and recognizes revenue for these aspen services on a per transaction or subscription basis as information is captured  stored  retrieved and processed 
the decisions by a healthcare provider to replace  substantially modify  or upgrade its information systems are a strategic decision and often involve a large capital commitment requiring an extended approval process 
since inception  lanvision has experienced extended sales cycles 
it is not uncommon for sales cycles to take six to eighteen months from initial contact to the execution of an agreement 
as a result  the sales cycles can cause significant variations in quarter to quarter operating results 
these agreements cover the licensing  implementation and maintenance of the system  which typically takes place in one or more phases 
the licensing agreements generally provide for the licensing of lanvision s proprietary software and third party software with a perpetual or term license fee that is adjusted depending on the number of concurrent users or workstations using the software 
site specific customization  interfaces with existing customer systems and other consulting services are sold on a fixed fee or a time and materials basis 
alternatively  with lanvision s asp services solution  the application hosting services agreements generally provide for utilizing lanvision s software and third party software on a fee per transaction or recurring subscription basis 
aspen services was designed to overcome obstacles in the buying decision such as large capital commitment  length of implementation  and the scarcity of time for healthcare information systems personnel to implement new systems 
lanvision believes that large idn s and smaller healthcare providers are looking for this type of asp application because of the ease of implementation and lower entry level costs 
lanvision believes its business model is especially well suited for the medium to small acute care facility marketplace as well as the ambulatory marketplace and is actively pursuing remarketing agreements  in addition to those discussed below  with other healthcare information systems his and staff outsourcing providers to distribute lanvision s workflow solutions 
generally  revenues from systems sales are recognized when an agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenue recognition related to routine installation  integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
revenues from consulting  training  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of the revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
in  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation  which was acquired by ge healthcare  a unit of the general electric company in january under the terms of the remarketing agreement  idx was granted a non exclusive worldwide license to distribute all lanvision workflow software including accessanyware tm  codinganyware tm  and aspen application hosting services to idx customers and prospective customers  as defined in the remarketing agreement 
under the terms of a remarketing agreement with idx  lanvision records this revenue when the products are made available to end users  which is usually at the same time the royalty report is received from idx 
royalties are remitted by idx to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on specific milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
lanvision s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to do so in the future because of various reasons including demand for lanvision s products and services  long sales cycles  and extended installation and implementation cycles based on customer s schedules 
sales are often delayed because of 
table of contents customers budgets and competing capital expenditure needs as well as personnel resource constraints within an integrated delivery network 
delays in anticipated sales or installations may have a significant impact on lanvision s quarterly revenues and operating results  because substantial portions of the operating expenses are fixed 
the us department of health and human services  in its national health expenditure projections released in january  believe that the health spending expenditures will reach trillion in  growing at an average annual rate of during the forecasted period as a share of the gross domestic product  health spending is projected to reach by up from its level of 
total spending on healthcare was trillion in  over four times the amount spent on defense source national coalition on health care 
hospital spending accounted for of the growth in personal health spending between and and increased to by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services projections indicate that by  health spending will account for of gross domestic product  up from in and the growth in spending is projected to average a year 
in response to this growth  the healthcare industry is undergoing significant change as competition and cost containment measures imposed by governmental and private payers have created significant pressures on healthcare providers to control healthcare costs while providing quality patient care 
at the same time  the healthcare delivery system is experiencing a shift from a highly fragmented group of non allied healthcare providers to integrated healthcare networks  which combine all of the services  products and equipment necessary to address the needs of healthcare customers 
as a result  healthcare providers are seeking to cut costs  increase productivity and enhance the quality of patient care through improved access to information throughout the entire hospital or integrated healthcare network 
today  the majority of the patient records are paper based 
the inefficiencies of paper based records increase the cost of patient care 
physicians often cannot gain access to medical records at the time of patient visits  and multiple users cannot simultaneously access the record when only a single copy of the paper based patient record is available 
based upon lanvision s experience in installing its systems  a typical bed hospital can produce  to  pages of new patient information each day even with computerized admission  billing  laboratory and radiology systems  and individual physician document retrieval requests can be as high as documents per physician per day 
the volume of medical images in the patient record is expanding as well 
in addition to images such as x rays and cat scans  mri s  new image forms such as digitized slides  videos and photographs proliferate 
thus  the ability to store and retrieve images of voluminous paper records and medical images on a timely basis is a critical feature of a complete computerized patient record 
in order to simultaneously reduce costs and enhance the level of patient care  hospitals and other healthcare providers are requiring comprehensive  cost effective information systems that deliver rapid access to fully updated and complete patient information 
traditional healthcare information systems are inadequate because i they do not capture large amounts of the patient records which are paper based and stored in various sites throughout the enterprise  ii computerized patient data is generated using a variety of disparate systems which cannot share information  and iii multimedia medical information such as x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information are frequently inaccessible at the point of patient care 
accordingly  hospitals and other healthcare providers have begun to increase their information systems expenditures 
in the eleventh annual healthcare information and management systems society himss leadership survey  healthcare business issues were driving information technology priorities with over half of the respondents indicating that cost pressures would continue to be a driving force in improving operational efficiencies 
included in the top ten information technology priorities was the implementation of computerized patient records 
respondents believe that implementing ehealth and hipaa health insurance portability and accountability act of strategies see regulations relating to confidentiality below will consume most of the information technology budget  because use of interactive ehealth solutions has become a competitive advantage 
providers  payers and suppliers know that the consequences of ignoring an ehealth strategy will result in the loss of market share 
lanvision believes that the hipaa regulations are an additional impetus for idn s to embrace lanvision products and services as a means of ensuring compliance with federal regulations 
a medical records institute survey of electronic health records trends and usage reported that one of the more interesting findings indicated 
table of contents that of the respondents acknowledge that emr systems can help improve workflow  said that such systems can help improve clinical documentation  and said emrs will help improve patient safety 
document imaging and workflow management technologies are essential elements of a complete emr because they allow for the storage of unstructured data ie  patient record elements other than data or text  such as hand written physician or nursing notes and physician orders  photographs  images of a document and they enable digitized x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information to be accessed and delivered to the caregiver at the point of patient care 
lanvision believes the demand for its medical record workflow solutions  which can supply document imaging capabilities to the emr  will increase in future years 
also  a himss leadership survey indicated that of the survey respondents were interested in outsourcing information technology functions in asp services 
additionally  the information technology individuals responding to the himss leadership survey indicated that security related to patient records to meet hipaa regulations was the second most important information technology priority within their institutions 
the number one priority was to deploy internet technology to support ehealth by moving healthcare information to the web 
in addition to mandated hipaa regulations  the healthcare industry is being strongly encouraged by many professional medical organizations to make greater use of information technology 
a report by the institute of medicine iom of the national academies  entitled to err is human building a better health system  envisioned a revamped system that  among other things  makes greater use of information technology to enable providers and institutions to move away from paper based medical record systems to take advantage of new information technology 
the american medical association  american academy of family physicians  american college of physicians  american society of internal medicine  and the american college of surgeons  issued a joint statement supporting the iom recommendations 
current regulatory matters the us department of health and human services hss has asked the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences to design a standardized model of an electronic health record  in a move that may help spur nationwide acceptance of emr s 
the impact of such a change  if implemented by hss  on current lanvision products and services is unknown at this time 
however  lanvision believes that its software and systems are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing regulatory requirements 
also  in  president bush put forth the goal of establishing emr s for most americans within years 
according to a wall street journal article dated april   a new national health technology coordinator has been appointed who reports to the secretary of hss 
his responsibility is specifically to create a plan to guide the highly fragmented industry toward an interoperable electronic medical records system 
the hss secretary has also announced incentives for healthcare providers to speed up the conversion to electronic medical records  with possible regional grants  low rate loans and various pilot programs 
the bush administration made million available for electronic records demonstration projects in the president s budget doubled that amount to million 
as noted in a wall street journal article dated july   putting such a system in place can cost a major hospital million or more 
hss estimates that in the us  only about of hospitals have adopted electronic health records for patients 
as a result  the health care industry lags far behind most other industries in using computers 
according to an october  business week online article president bush appointed david j 
brailer as national coordinator for health information technology in the health and human services department 
his task is to give every american an electronic medical record of their health care by  and link all the records into one giant medical internet  called the national health information network 
dr 
brailer s team will build the network s backbone and set the standards for swapping data 
physicians and hospitals will have to pay for the computers  software  and other infrastructure  which according to brailer is estimated at up to billion over five years 
president s information technology advisory committee on june   the president s information technology advisory committee issued its report entitled revolutionizing health care through information technology  which focused on the most fundamental and pervasive problem of healthcare delivery the paper based medical record 
in the report  they stated the potential of information technology to reduce the number of medical errors  reduce cost  and improve patient care is 
table of contents enormous 
the essence of our recommendations is a framework for st century health care information infrastructure that revolutionizes medical records systems 
the four core elements of this framework are electronic health records for all americans that provide every patient and his or her caregivers the necessary information required for optimal care while reducing costs and administrative overhead 
computer assisted clinical decision support to increase the ability of health care providers to take advantage of state of the art medical knowledge as they make treatment decisions enabling the practice of evidenced based medicine 
computerized provider order entry such as for tests  medicine  and procedures both for outpatient care and within the hospital environment 
secure  private  interoperable  electronic health information exchange  including both highly specific standards for capturing new data and tools for capturing non standard compliant electronic information from legacy systems 
lanvision s current products and services can currently be used to implement some of the recommendations or provide interim solutions to some of the aspects recommended in items  above  especially with regard to legacy  paper based  medical information  order entry systems  other than medication  and security of exchanging health information 
based on the federal initiatives noted above  lanvision believes that its product and services are able to support these and other similar initiatives  and its products are currently available and installed at leading healthcare facilities throughout the us regulations relating to confidentiality federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient health information 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to evolve 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information phi 
the legislation requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
regulations adopted pursuant to hipaa include rules addressing several areas 
compliance with the new privacy rule was required by most covered entities other than small health plans by april the final privacy rule also extended the scope of enforcement to phi residing on non electronic media  such as paper  as well as to email  oral and written communications 
the regulations under the security rule were effective in april  with a compliance date of april small health plans have until april to comply with the security rule 
the regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on its business 
lanvision cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised the regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
lanvision believes that the features and architecture of lanvision s products are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of products and adversely effect the licensing of lanvision s products 
overall  lanvision believes the hipaa regulations will continue to stimulate healthcare organizations to purchase computer based emr systems that automate the collection  use  and disclosure of patient health information  while maintaining appropriate security 
table of contents and audit controls over the information 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of lanvision application hosting services will occur 
rapid technological change and evolving market the market for lanvision s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  lanvision s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
lanvision s future success will depend  in part  upon lanvision s ability to enhance its existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing requirements 
changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry lanvision derives substantially all of its revenues from the licensing of software  providing professional services and maintenance services and providing application hosting services within the healthcare industry 
accordingly  the success of lanvision is dependent upon the regulatory and economic conditions in the healthcare industry 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to establish integrated delivery networks to take advantage of economies of scale  greater marketing power and greater leverage in negotiating with vendors who supply the industry with the goods and services they require 
the impact of such consolidations  lanvision believes  will benefit lanvision as more healthcare organizations investigate methods to streamline operations  including outsourcing non core services to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care through the use of information technology  especially in the paper intensive area of patient medical records and patient financial services 
key personnel lanvision s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management and technical personnel 
lanvision must recruit  motivate and retain highly skilled managers  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which lanvision s products operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse impact on the company 
limited protection of proprietary technology the success of lanvision depends on the protection of its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary technology 
lanvision relies on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure  license  and employment agreements  trade secret laws  copyrights  and restrictions on the disclosure of its intellectual property 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to lanvision s products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend lanvision s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
lanvision could also be required to defend itself against claims made by third parties for intellectual property right infringement 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
warranties and indemnities lanvision s products are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
failure of any lanvision product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require lanvision to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting lanvision to liability 
also  lanvision indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
if lanvision becomes liable to a third party for infringement of their intellectual property  lanvision could be required to pay substantial amounts as damages  obtain a license to 
table of contents use the infringing technologies  develop its own noninfringing technologies  or cease using the infringing intellectual property 
competition several companies historically have dominated the healthcare clinical information system software market and several of these companies have either acquired  developed or are developing their own document imaging and workflow technologies 
the industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
strategic alliances between vendors offering medical record workflow and document imaging technologies and vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing 
barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication  the ability to offer a proven product  a well established customer base and distribution channels  brand recognition  the ability to operate on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms  the ability to integrate with pre existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities 
lanvision believes that these barriers taken together represent a moderate to high level barrier to entry 
foreign competition has not been a significant factor in the market  to date 
lanvision s competitors include clinical information system vendors that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources than lanvision 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom lanvision may establish strategic alliances may also compete with lanvision 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding lanvision  place bids for large agreements in competition with lanvision 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by lanvision could have a material adverse effect on lanvision 
lanvision believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  lanvision believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
lanvision believes that its principal competitors are american management systems  incorporated  cerner corporation  eclipsys corporation  hyland software  inc  mckesson hboc  inc  medplus  inc 
a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated  perceptive vision  inc  siemens medical solutions usa  inc a subsidiary of siemens ag  and softmed systems  inc 
the lanvision solution lanvision s products and services streamline information flows and provide medical record workflow  patient financial services and other departmental workflow solutions for the patient and other information access needs of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks

lanvision s systems i capture and store electronic data from disparate hospital information systems through real time  computerized interfaces  ii provide applications for efficiently scanning and automatically indexing paper based records  iii allow storage of a patient s lifetime medical record on secure media which also provides rapid access to high volumes of data enterprisewide  iv provide technologically advanced workflow automation software to facilitate the re engineering of business processes  and v incorporate physician oriented interfaces that allow the user to easily locate and retrieve patient information in the hospital or clinical setting  including the point of patient care 
lanvision s medical record workflow and patient financial services workflow solutions provide financial  administrative  and clinical benefits to the healthcare provider and facilitate more effective patient care 
these 
table of contents benefits include improved access to patient information to assist in making informed clinical and financial decisions  reduced costs for administrative personnel due to increased workflow efficiency  as data can be routed within an organization to all users who need to process that information simultaneously or in sequence as required  increased productivity through the elimination of file contention by providing multiple users simultaneous access to patient medical records  reduced costs and improved care through the reduction of unnecessary testing and admissions  improved cash flow through accelerated account receivable collections and reductions in technical denials which occur when a third party payer refuses payment because of the provider s inability to substantiate billing claims due to loss of portions or all of the patient record  expedited treatment decisions  and fewer redundant tests as a result of timely access to complete information  fewer medical record errors by minimizing misfiled  lost and improperly completed records  and increased security of patient information through improved controls on access to confidential data and the creation of audit trails that identify the persons who accessed or even tried to access such information 
the lanvision strategy lanvision s objective is to continue to be a leading provider of medical record and patient financial services workflow solutions to the healthcare industry 
important elements of lanvision s business strategy include expand distribution channels lanvision estimates the total market for lanvision s document management products and services could be in excess of billion  and the market is less than penetrated 
a healthcare industry report stated that in order to comply with the hipaa healthcare information electronic transmission regulations  healthcare systems will need to adjust existing systems or purchase new information technology systems  hire and retrain staff  and make significant changes to the current processes associated with maintaining patient privacy  the cost of which is estimated to be somewhere between three to four times the amount of expenditures required for year remediation  or an amount in excess of billion 
lanvision strongly believes its highly evolved  secure and technologically advanced web browser based asp solutions will position lanvision to take advantage of  what it continues to believe will be  significantly increasing market opportunities for lanvision and its distribution partners in the future 
as previously noted in  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx now ge healthcare  which offers a wide variety of patient care products to integrated delivery networks  group practices  academic medical centers  radiological centers  and hospitals nationwide 
idx has installed its products at more than  customer sites with systems deployed to serve over  physicians

lanvision believes only the most robust  flexible  dependable products will survive in the healthcare market  and lanvision has attempted to establish itself as a leader in document imaging management and workflow applications through strong product development 
image enable clinical data repositories and other applications software today  healthcare information is often stored on numerous dissimilar host based and departmental systems that are spread throughout an enterprise and are not integrated 
additionally  these current systems do not address the data stored on paper or the increasing volume of medical images such as cat scans  mri s  digitized slides  exploratory scopes  photographs  audio  etc 
lanvision believes the efficiencies and productivity of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks can be greatly enhanced by seamlessly integrating their historical information systems with document imaging and workflow applications 
physicians  clinicians  and other healthcare users then have access to the complete patient medical record  including the structured data  such as laboratory results  and related unstructured data  or a doctor s hand written notes 
lanvision has image enabled many popular clinical data repositories  such as those offered by oacis healthcare holdings corp  idx information systems corporation  and cerner corporation 
lanvision is marketing image enabling technology through its accessanyware and lanvision application bridge products 
lanvision intends to continue to aggressively market its unique image enabling solutions to end users and other third party software application providers

the functions presented to the user vary with the user s security 
for example  if the user is a clinician  he she is presented with an inbox function that displays a list of incomplete charts awaiting completion and a list of linked patients assigned to them 
the clinician then has the option to complete deficient charts or retrieve patient information via searching or by clicking on the linked patients within their inbox 
this access may occur from any workstation within the facility  the physician s office  or some other remote site 
with proper security  the user is able to view  print and fax patient information 
releaseanyware lanvision clients also have the option of further enhancing the productivity of their operations through the releaseanyware workflow module which fulfills internal and external requests for patient information and allows for automatic invoicing capability 
it also provides the ability to electronically search for  print  mail or fax information to third parties that request copies of patient records 
codinganyware due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient 
in  lanvision introduced codinganyware  which provides workflow automation of the coding and abstracting process by allowing hospital personnel to electronically access documents to be coded and abstracted from remote locations  including the employee s home

the small number of customers  the dependence on remarketing partner idx  and extended sales cycles has contributed to variability in quarterly and annual operating results 
lanvision expects that as its customer base continues to increase and sales through its remarketing agreements increase  the actions of any one customer will have less of an effect on its quarterly and annual operating results 
the loss of a major customer or the remarketing partner idx could have a material adverse effect on lanvision 
signed agreements backlog see also item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog  for an explanation of the current year backlog compared with the prior year backlog 
lanvision enters into master agreements with its customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed and or services to be provided by lanvision  the agreed upon aggregate price and the timetable for implementation 
the master agreement typically provides that lanvision will deliver the system in phases  thereby allowing the customer flexibility in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in customer needs 
the master agreement also allows the customer to request 
table of contents additional components as the installation progresses  which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and terms 
historically  customers have ultimately purchased systems and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the master agreement  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
at january   lanvision has master agreements  purchase orders  or royalty reports from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based revenues for the application hosting services that have not been delivered  installed which  if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  the related products and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
furthermore  lanvision has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years and lanvision s master agreements also generally provide for a limited initial maintenance period and require the customer to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
maintenance and support revenues for fiscal years   and were approximately   and  respectively 
maintenance and support revenues are expected to increase in the future 
at january   lanvision had maintenance agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year and the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  lanvision is unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
lanvision s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by lanvision  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of lanvision to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on lanvision s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
royalties lanvision incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate lanvision s proprietary software 
lanvision licenses these software products  and pays the required royalties and or license fees when such software is delivered to lanvision s customers 
employees as of january   lanvision had full time employees 
in addition  lanvision utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of lanvision s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
lanvision has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good

item a risk factors see also  part i  item  business 

table of contents the variability of quarterly operating results can be significant 
the company s future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the relatively large size of customer agreements  unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales  length of the sales cycle  delays in installations and changes in customer s financial condition or budgets 
the company needs to manage its growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of growth and expansion which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the company s services and support operations  sales and administrative personnel and other resources 
lanvision believes that it must expand the workforce to serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base 
the company s ability to successfully expand its operations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s ability to manage its planned growth effectively also will require the company to continue to improve its operational  management  and financial systems and controls  to train  motivate  and manage its employees and to increase its operating expenses in anticipation that such growth will increase future revenues 
the company could be less profitable than expected 
because of the relatively fixed operating expenses and overhead  the future profitability of the company is dependent on increasing revenues which may not materialize as anticipated 
sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
the company s revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers  and the company has historically derived a substantial percentage of its total revenues from a few customers 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of lanvision to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on lanvision s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s major reseller could choose to discontinue reselling lanvision products  and significant customers could elect to discontinue using our products 
the company needs to ensure that the company expands the distribution channels to reduce the reliance on a single major reseller and expand the customer base to ensure that the loss of a customer is not a significant loss in total revenues 
lanvision faces significant competition  including from companies with significantly greater resources 
the company currently competes with more than eight other companies for the licensing of competitive software products and the related services 
most of these companies are larger than us  and have significantly more resources to invest in their business 
lanvision s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of lanvision s products and services 
the company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property  which represents an important asset to the company 
lanvision does not have any patent protection on any of its software 
the company relies upon license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc 
to maintain the confidentiality of lanvision s proprietary information and trade secrets 
if the company fails to adequately protect the intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights  license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc  the intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated  or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage the company may have 
also  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials are produced as our software functionality is expanded 
any claim  even if not meritorious  would be expensive to defend  and if the company were to become liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights  the company could be liable 
table of contents for substantial damage awards  and potentially be required to cease using the technology  produce noninfringing technology or obtain a license to use such technology 
due to the rapid pace of technology change  the company believes the future success is likely to depend upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of our property rights 
however  the company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary 
rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm lanvision s business 
the technology underlying lanvision s product is subject to rapid change including the potential introduction of new products and technologies  which may have a material  adverse impact on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company needs to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new products and apply new technologies to the existing products 
the impact of new or changes in existing federal  state  and local regulations governing healthcare information healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on business 
however  the company cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
lanvision believes that the features and architecture of lanvision s products are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect lanvision s business 
lanvision s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management and technical personnel 
the company must recruit  motivate  and retain highly skilled managers  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants  and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which our products operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
lanvision software may not be error free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities 
lanvision software products are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
although the company performs extensive testing  failure of any product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require us to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting the company to liability 
lanvision s license agreement generally limits our liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the application hosting services and support services could experience interruptions 
the company performs hosting services for certain clients  including the storage of critical patient and administrative data 
in addition  we provide support services to our clients through our client support facility 
the company has redundancies  such as backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines  built into its operations to prevent disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the building or equipment inside the buildings housing our data center or client support facilities could cause a disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on us for application hosting services 
any interruption in operations at our data center or client support facility could cause 
table of contents us to lose existing clients  impede our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  cause potential liability to our clients  and increase our operating costs 
third party products are essential to lanvision s software 
lanvision software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate our proprietary software 
the loss of the ability to use these third party products  or ability to obtain substitute third party software at comparable prices  could have a material adverse affect on our ability to license our software 
the company could be liable to customers or third parties 
the company s systems provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care 
the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims 
the company attempts to limit any potential liability of the company to customers by limiting the warranties on its systems in the company s agreements with healthcare provider 
however  such agreements do not protect the company from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care 
the company maintains insurance  which provide limited protection from such claims  if they are successfully litigated 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of our software solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company needs to continuously anticipate future events  such as changes in regulations that could affect its products  and the probability of natural disasters  catastrophes war  or terrorism etc 
the company may not correctly anticipate such future events which could have a material adverse impact on the company 
item properties lanvision s principal offices are located at alliance road  suite  cincinnati  oh the offices consist of approximately  square feet of space under a lease that expires in july in addition  lanvision leases dedicated collocation high security data center space in the cincinnati  oh area  for its aspen services  application hosting data center operations  which leases expire in june  but has automatic renewal provisions 
the current rental expense for all of these facilities approximates  annually 
lanvision believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs and that suitable alternative space is available to accommodate expansion of lanvision s operations 
item legal proceedings lanvision is  from time to time  a party to various legal proceedings and claims  which arise  in the ordinary course of business from time to time

see also part  item a risk factors for a general description of factors that affect lanvision s business 
application of critical accounting policies see also notes to consolidated financial statements lanvision s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires lanvision to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  lanvision evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  support contracts  contingencies and litigation 
lanvision bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that lanvision believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
lanvision believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lanvision records revenues for customer contracts  including special payment agreements and royalties from third party resellers in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from the licensing and sale of systems  either directly to end users or through third party resellers  comprising internally developed software  third party software and hardware components  product support  maintenance and professional services  and  application hosting services that provide high quality  transaction or subscriptions based document imaging management services from a central data center 
generally  revenues from software license fees and hardware sales to end users are recognized when a master agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenues from agreements that contain multiple element arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the elements 
revenues related to routine installation and integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
revenues from consulting  education  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
under the terms of a remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation  lanvision records this revenue when the products are made available to end users  which is usually at the same time the royalty report is received from idx 
royalties are remitted by idx to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on specific milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
bad debts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed lanvision for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting activities 
contracts with individual 
table of contents customers and resellers determine when receivables are due 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof 
corrective action  if necessary  is taken by lanvision to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these quarterly reviews  lanvision determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of lanvision s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell lanvision s products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of lanvision receivables is not uncommon 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred

lanvision relies on idx for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on future results of operations 
lanvision believes a greater percentage of its future revenues will come from remarketing agreements with  idx  and other his related vendors 
lanvision continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other companies 
lanvision believes the large his vendors  hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks now have a better understanding of the valuable role the emr plays in providing a truly computerized patient record and the benefits of such systems in developing advanced workflow solutions 
as more healthcare providers become aware of and better understand the significant economic and operating benefits of the emr and other imaging management and workflow applications  lanvision believes the future demand for its products and services will increase 
many companies have emerged to provide healthcare applications through private intranets or secure applications on the internet 
additionally  the traditional his companies have developed clinical information systems for the internet 
lanvision s applications are well suited for integration with such clinical systems and are optimized for use on the internet and private intranets 
through lanvision s aspen services  application hosting customers can rapidly deploy and access healthcare information using web browser based technology from a central data center on a per transaction or subscription basis thereby minimizing up front capital expenditures 
lanvision believes healthcare organizations will continue to increase their use of healthcare applications through 
table of contents the internet  and lanvision s products are an integral part of providing a complete emr across the internet 
lanvision continues to actively pursue strategic relationships with other healthcare application service providers 
management believes that revenue growth can be fueled by the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts  the repositioning and re branding of the company  an increase in incremental revenue from existing and new strategic distribution partners  an increase in interest by healthcare organizations in lanvision products and services to assist in compliance with the federal hipaa standards as they relate to the confidentiality and security of medical records  and incremental new revenues derived from new lines of business for lanvision in the remote coding  revenue cycle and other workflows for the hospital marketplace 
the revenue cycle workflows are a logical extension of the product line because of the ability of the financial services departments of hospitals to access and process patient information from the emr 
due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient 
since commencing operations in  lanvision has incurred substantial cumulative operating losses 
although lanvision achieved operating profitability during the last six years  lanvision incurred net losses in most fiscal years prior to fiscal year based upon the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability is dependent upon increasing revenues 
although the company believes that it can continue to be profitable  there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to neither achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of lanvision in the near or long term 
liquidity and capital resources during the last five fiscal years  lanvision has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  and a  bank loan 
lanvision s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors to include the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major his companies that resell lanvision s products which have good credit histories and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
lanvision has no significant obligations for capital resources  other than its  of long term debt  the noncancelable operating leases of approximately  payable over the next five years and capitalized leases of approximately  payable over the next three years 
capital expenditures for property and equipment in are not expected to exceed during the last three years  lanvision has expended approximately  for capital expenditures  increased its sales and marketing expenses  product research and development and support and consulting expenses  and made net debt and deferred interest repayments of approximately  this resulted in significant net cash outlays over the last three years 
although lanvision reduced staffing levels and related expenses during and  the stringent expense controls and reduced staffing  caused by the necessity to retire the long term debt  hampered the growth of revenues in fiscal year and accordingly  to continue to achieve increasing revenues and profitability it was necessary for the company to significantly increase the sales and marketing expenses in fiscal and will continue to do so in the company believes that this strategic initiative to expand sales and marketing should produce improved results in late and beyond as the expanded sales and marketing efforts begin to produce results 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
at january   lanvision had cash of  under the terms of its loan agreement  as amended  lanvision has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance equal to the balance of the long term debt currently 
table of contents  of which  is repayable on july  through the earlier of the repayment or maturity of the loan on july  the current loan can be repaid at any time without penalty 
lanvision has carefully monitored operating expenses during the last five fiscal years 
notwithstanding the current levels of revenues and operating profit  for the foreseeable future  lanvision will need to continually assess its revenue prospects compared to its then current expenditure levels 
if it does not appear likely that revenues will increase  it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or raise cash through additional borrowings  the sale of assets  or other equity financing 
certain of these actions will require current lender approval 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be successful in any of these efforts 
if it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses  this could have an adverse effect on future operating performance 
lanvision believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation currently anticipated from operations  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the short term 
however  continued expansion of the company in will require additional resources 
the company may need to refinance its current debt  obtain an additional infusion of capital  or a combination of both  depending on the extent of the expansion of the company and future revenues 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on lanvision s revenues or expenses 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal exceeded  down from approximately  in the prior fiscal year primarily because of the increase in receivables resulting from increased fourth quarter revenues 
cash was used in fiscal primarily for financing activities  primarily the repayment of debt 
future cash flow from operations is dependent upon revenues and the terms and conditions relating to the timing of payments of new agreements 
in  the company intends to invest in additional operating expenses which will reduce the amount of cash flow from operations available for investing and financing activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lanvision currently invests its cash balances  in excess of its current needs in an interest bearing account 
lanvision does not invest for the purposes of trading in securities 
additionally  lanvision does not have any significant market risk exposure at january
