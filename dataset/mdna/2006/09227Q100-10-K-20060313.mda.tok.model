overview we are the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations 
our products and services enable nonprofit organizations to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve communications with constituents  manage their finances and optimize internal operations 
we have focused solely on the nonprofit market since our incorporation in and have developed our suite of products and services based upon our extensive knowledge of the operating challenges facing nonprofit organizations 
in  we had over  customers  of which or almost  pay annual maintenance and support fees 
our customers operate in multiple verticals within the nonprofit market including religion  education  foundations  health and human services  arts and cultural  public and societal benefits  environment and animal welfare  and international foreign affairs 
we derive revenue from licensing software products and providing a broad offering of services  including consulting  training  installation  implementation  and donor prospect research and modeling services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
consulting  training and implementation are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products and are sold separately 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from these services separately from license fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to our allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  revenue recognition  and provision for income taxes and realization of deferred tax assets 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we are not aware of any circumstances in the past  which have caused these estimates and assumptions to be materially wrong 
furthermore  we are not currently aware of any material changes in our business that might cause these assumptions or estimates to differ significantly 
in our discussion below of deferred taxes  the most significant asset subject to such assumptions and estimates  we have described the sensitivity of these assumptions or estimates to potential deviations in actual results 
actual results could differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery occurs when the product is delivered 
our typical license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable with our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we postpone recognition of the revenue until cash collection 
we sell software licenses with maintenance and  often times  professional services 
we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to our company 
fair value for the maintenance services associated with our software licenses is based upon renewal rates stated in our agreements  which vary according to the level of the maintenance program 
fair value of professional services and other products and services  which is evaluated at least annually  is based on sales of these products and services to other customers when sold on a stand alone basis 
we recognize revenue from maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is usually one year 
maintenance revenue also includes the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
subscription revenue includes fees for hosted solutions  data enrichment services and hosted online training programs 
subscription based revenue and any related set up fees are recognized ratably over the twelve month service period of the contracts 
hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the thirty six month period of the hosting contracts 
our services  which include consulting  installation and implementation services  are generally billed based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel and lodging related expenses 
for small service engagements  less than approximately  we frequently contract for and bill based on a fixed fee plus reimbursable travel and lodging related expenses 
we recognize this revenue upon completion of the work performed 
when our services include software customization  these services are provided to support customer requests for assistance in creating special reports and other minor enhancements that will assist with efforts to improve operational efficiency and or to support business process improvements 
these services are not essential to the functionality of our software and rarely exceed three months in duration 
we recognize 
table of contents revenue as these services are performed 
when we sell hosting separately from consulting  installation and implementation services  we recognize that revenue ratably over the service period 
we sell training at a fixed rate for each specific class  at a per attendee price  or at a packaged price for several attendees  and revenue is recognized only upon the customer attending and completing training 
during the second quarter of  we introduced the blackbaud training pass  which permits customers to attend unlimited training over a specified contract period  typically one year  subject to certain restrictions 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period that is typically one year 
we recognize revenue from donor prospect research and data modeling service engagements upon delivery 
to the extent that our customers pay for the above described services in advance of delivery  the amounts are recorded in deferred revenue 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customers a day right of return and maintain a reserve for returns 
we estimate the amount of this reserve based on historical experience 
provisions for sales returns are charged against the related revenue items 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables 
any necessary provision is reflected in general and administrative expense 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  the undiscounted cash flow method is used to determine whether the asset is impaired 
cash flows would include the estimated terminal value of the asset and exclude any interest charges 
to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset  the impairment is measured using discounted cash flows 
the discount rate utilized would be based on our best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value  which could materially adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
all of the goodwill is assigned to a single reporting unit 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this pronouncement  there is generally no cost associated with options that are granted with an exercise price equal to or above the fair value per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
because there was no public market for our stock prior to our initial public offering in july  our board of directors estimated the fair value of our common 
table of contents stock by considering a number of factors  including our operating performance  significant events in our history  trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
grants under two of our option plans  covering approximately million options  contained provisions that resulted in them being treated as variable awards under apb no 
the effect of this accounting is that an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price of the options and the estimated current fair value is charged to deferred compensation and amortized as an expense over the related vesting periods of the grants using the accelerated method outlined in fasb financial interpretation number  or fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or awards plans 
under variable award accounting  the affected option grants continue to be marked to market until such time as the amount of related compensation is deemed fixed 
approximately million options are no longer being accounted for as variable awards following the occurrence of our initial public offering in july the remaining million options  which were held by our former chief executive officer  were accounted for as a variable award until the grant was exercised for all but shares during the components of stock based compensation expense benefit for the year ended december  are presented below in thousands q q q q charge credit to adjust deferred compensation associated with fully vested options of former ceo to period end closing stock price charge to adjust deferred compensation associated with option exercises of former ceo to stock price on date of transaction amortization of deferred compensation associated with formerly variable options which became fixed upon the company s ipo amortization of deferred compensation associated with restricted stock grants total we have separately disclosed stock based compensation throughout this discussion and in our financial statements and we have shown a reconciliation of stock based compensation as it relates to sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses on the statement of operations because  in managing our operations  we believe such costs significantly affect our ability to better understand and manage other operating expenses and cash needs 
we have also disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the pro forma effects of accounting for our stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as well as the underlying assumptions 
we used the following assumptions in the calculation of stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
years ended december  volatility dividend yield risk free interest rate expected option life in years 
table of contents deferred taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in a net deferred tax asset  which is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
the final tax outcome of these matters might be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  benefits and accruals 
any difference could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
prior to october   we were organized as an s corporation under the internal revenue code and  therefore  were not subject to federal income taxes 
in addition  the company was not subject to income tax in many of the states in which it operated as a result of its s corporation status 
we historically made distributions to our stockholders to cover the stockholders anticipated tax liability 
in connection with the recapitalization agreement see note to the financial statements  we converted our us taxable status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
accordingly  since october  we have been subject to federal and state income taxes 
upon the conversion and in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded a one time benefit of million to establish a deferred tax asset as a result of the recapitalization agreement 
we must assess the likelihood that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
except with respect to the state income tax credits discussed below  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  and  because we expect to be able to utilize our entire net deferred tax asset 
the ability to utilize our net deferred tax asset is solely dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
based on current estimates of revenue and expenses  we expect future taxable income will be more than sufficient to recover the annual amount of additional tax deductions permitted 
even if actual results are significantly below our current estimates  the recovery still remains likely and no valuation allowance would be necessary 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we record our tax provision at the anticipated tax rates based on estimates of annual pretax income 
to the extent that the final results differ from these estimated amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made and could have an impact on the deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at an amount based upon a blended us federal income tax rate of 
this us federal income tax rate is based on our expectation that our deductible and taxable temporary differences will reverse over a period of years during which  except for and due to anticipated stock option exercises  we will have annual taxable income exceeding million per year 
if our results of operations worsen in the future  such that our annual taxable income will be expected to fall below million  we will adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities to an amount reflecting a reduced expected us federal income tax rate  consistent with the corresponding expectation of lower taxable income 
if such change is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 

table of contents our deferred tax asset at december  also included state income tax credits  net of federal taxes at  of approximately million that expire between and we established a full valuation allowance against these credits when the asset was recorded because  based on information available at that time  it was not deemed probable that these credits would be realized 
during  as a result of profitable results in and  expectations of future profitability and utilization of all related state net operating losses  we released million of the valuation allowance related to these state income tax credits which resulted in a credit to our income tax expense for additionally  certain other state tax credits whose use was previously restricted to reducing state franchise taxes became available to offset state income tax as a result of a clarification in enacted tax law during accordingly  a deferred tax asset was established during of million  net of federal taxes at  related to the associated future reduction of state income taxes 
a valuation allowance was established for million of the million representing the portion of the credits now deemed more likely than not to be utilized 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the remaining state tax credits and any further adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period we determine it is more likely than not any of the remaining credits will be utilized 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies in the normal course of business 
we accrue for loss contingencies when a loss is estimable and probable
