item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of advanced wireless communications products for diverse commercial  defense and government markets 
we focus on the needs of the mobile information user and the increasing demand for wireless broadband communications 
our products enable communications across a variety of coverage areas  ranging from global to regional to within a single building 
our continuing operations include the following four business units defense space systems highly engineered hardware for satellites and defense electronics applications  lxe rugged mobile computer terminals and other equipment for wireless local area networks  satcom satellite communications antennas and terminals for aircraft and ground based vehicles  other portable satellite terminals  and satellite ground stations for search and rescue operations  ems wireless base station antennas and signal repeaters for pcs cellular systems 
we sell our defense space systems products primarily for defense applications 
we sell our ems wireless products exclusively  and our lxe products predominantly  for commercial applications 
we also sell the majority of our satcom products for commercial applications 
sales of products for us government end use comprised and of our net sales in and  respectively 
our sales to customers in the united states accounted for of our consolidated net sales in and of our consolidated net sales in the largest single geographic market for our products outside the us has recently been the united kingdom  which accounted for and of net sales in and respectively 
net sales from our non us markets have generally increased when the euro and other local functional currencies have increased in value as compared with the us dollar 
following is a summary of significant factors affecting the company in for continuing operations net sales reached an all time high of million from continuing operations in this was mainly due to record sales recorded at our ems wireless and satcom divisions  and from continued sales growth at our lxe division 
strong operating income was recorded by each of the four divisions in  and in total for continuing operations  was over those reported in for discontinued operations on november   the company completed the sale of the assets and operating liabilities of its space technology montreal division to macdonald  dettwiler and associates  ltd 
of vancouver  bc mda 
on march   the company completed the sale of the assets and operating liabilities of its satnet division to advanced microwave technologies  inc advantech 
included impairment charges of million for our satnet division and million for our space technology montreal division 
they were recorded to reflect the revised estimate of the fair value  less cost to sell  of these divisions 
the loss recorded for our discontinued operations also reflected cost increases on certain long term contracts at our space technology montreal s t montreal division  lower than expected net sales by our satnet division  and increases in reported costs for both of these canadian based operations as a result of a weaker us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
of 
table of contents description of net sales  costs and expenses net sales the amount of net sales reported in a given period is the most significant factor affecting our operating income 
we sell our products through established networks of value added resellers and systems integrators who incorporate our products into the systems they sell to end users 
in addition to product sales  we also generate net sales from the sale of maintenance and repair services 
such service revenues have been below of our net sales for each of the three years ended december  we recognize revenues under most of our customer agreements when we ship units or perform services 
if the customer agreement is in the form of a long term contract typical in our defense space systems division  we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  using the ratio of cost incurred to total estimated cost as the measure of performance 
cost of sales we conduct most of our manufacturing efforts in our atlanta area facilities  including the manufacture of all of our lxe and defense space systems products  as well as all ems wireless products for the us market 
we manufacture ems wireless products for distribution outside the us at our brazilian facility 
we manufacture all satcom products at our facility in ottawa  canada 
cost of sales includes the cost of materials  payroll and benefits for direct and indirect manufacturing labor  engineering and design costs  outside costs such as subcontracts  consulting or travel related to specific contracts  and manufacturing overhead expenses such as depreciation  utilities and facilities maintenance 
through our four divisions  we sell a wide range of wireless products into markets with varying competitive conditions  as a result  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  varies with each product 
the mix of products sold in a given period is a significant factor affecting our operating income 
in recent years  the cost of sales percentage has generally been lower for lxe and satcom products  as compared with products from our defense space systems and ems wireless divisions 
the cost of sales percentage is principally a function of competitive conditions  but our satcom division is also directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
satcom derives most of its net sales from contracts denominated in us dollars  but the canada based satcom division incurs most of its costs in canadian dollars 
as the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  our reported manufacturing costs may increase relative to our net sales  which increases the cost of sales percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include salaries  commissions  bonuses and related overhead costs for our personnel engaged in sales  administration  finance  human resources  information systems and legal functions 
also included in sg a are the costs of engaging outside professional services such as legal consultation  auditing and tax compliance  as well as general corporate expenditures to other outside suppliers and service providers 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses represent the cost of our development efforts  net of any reimbursement under specific customer funded r d agreements 
r d expenses include salaries of engineers and technicians and related overhead expenses  the cost of materials utilized in research  and additional engineering or consulting services provided by independent companies 
r d costs are expensed as they are incurred 
we also often incur significant development costs to meet the requirements of customer contracts in our defense space systems division  and we report these costs in the consolidated statements of operations as cost of sales 
of 
table of contents non operating income  net non operating income  net mainly includes the gain or loss on the sale or disposal of long lived assets that are held and used 
foreign exchange gains and losses we recognize foreign exchange gains and losses  mainly in our satcom and lxe divisions  related to assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency different from the local functional currency 
for our canada based satcom division  most trade receivables relate to contracts denominated in us dollars  when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the value of satcom s trade receivables decreases and foreign exchange losses result 
for our lxe division s europe based subsidiaries  most trade payables are in us dollars and relate to their purchases of hardware from lxe for sale in europe  when the us dollar weakens against the euro or other european currency  the value of the lxe subsidiaries trade payables decreases and foreign exchange gains result 
we enter into forward currency contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the notional amount of each forward currency contract is based on the amount of exposure for a specific asset or liability subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we mark these contracts to market in our consolidated statements of operations 
interest expense we incur interest expense related to our long term debt  principally revolving credit loans with us and canadian banks 
the interest rates on most of our long term debt are variable rates 
income tax expense the main factor affecting our effective income tax rate each year is the relative proportion of taxable income that we earn in canada  where we have a much lower effective rate than in the us  or other locations 
the lower effective rate in canada results from certain canadian tax benefits for research related expenditures 
discontinued operations we have reclassified the assets related to our s t montreal division through their date of disposition  and satellite networks division for all periods presented from assets held and used to assets held for sale  due to decisions to dispose of these operations in the third quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively 
our discontinued operations have not been profitable for any of the three years ended december  reflecting difficult market conditions for both divisions 
we recorded an impairment charge of million and million for our satnet division in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  and additional impairment charges of million and million in the second quarter of  and third quarter of  respectively  for our space technology montreal division

net sales for ems wireless increased as a result of significant orders placed by several us wireless service providers  beginning late in the first quarter of  for our antenna products to expand and upgrade their network coverage footprints 
satcom s net sales increased million mainly due to continued growth in high speed data aeronautical terminals reflecting growth in the military markets  and new us defense applications 
lxe s net sales increased million due mainly to increased shipments of products  which we believe was related to market acceptance of our latest product offerings 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was for  compared with for the increase in the cost of sales percentage was mainly due to the very high volume of sales at ems wireless  which typically carries a higher cost of sales  as well as a higher cost of sales percentage for a new model of base station antenna introduced in sg a  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from to 
the decrease in sg a percentage was related primarily to the large net sales increase at ems wireless and other divisions  which substantially increased the net sales over which we absorb fixed sg a 
actual expenses increased by million primarily due to an increased investment in sales and marketing expenditures in international markets by our lxe division  and higher domestic administrative expenses to support the continued growth in product sales in the americas 
an additional factor in the sg a growth was the weaker us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the fluctuations in the euro  which raised the reported us dollar equivalent of sg a expenses incurred in the canada based satcom division and in lxe s international subsidiaries 
of 
table of contents r d expenses decreased due to our planned transition from certain internal development programs at d ss that neared completion to more contract related efforts on these and other programs 
net r d also decreased as our satcom division engaged in more r d arrangements involving partial customer reimbursement 
the most significant element of non operating income for was a  pre tax gain for the sale of non operating real estate adjoining our facility in montreal that occurred in march of interest expenses increased from million in to million in due to higher interest rates and increased average debt levels 
the effective income tax rate was in as compared to in the increase is due to a significantly higher proportion of earnings in being derived from the us  which has a higher effective income tax rate than most other countries especially canada in which we do business 
our low effective rate in canada is due to research related tax benefits 
years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million in the largest growth occurred at lxe with a net sales increase of million  principally due to increased hardware sales  which we believe were related to our leadership in the introduction of new products  as well as favorable foreign exchange rates that enhanced market conditions in europe 
net sales of our defense space systems division also increased approximately million due to new orders for commercial applications of our antenna technologies 
these increases in net sales were substantially offset by declines in net sales at ems wireless and satcom 
we believe that ems wireless antenna markets were unfavorably affected in by consolidation in the telecommunications industry that delayed several carriers plans for system expansion 
in  net sales at satcom were the second highest in the division s history  but were less than the record levels set in  when orders benefited from new us defense applications of satcom products 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased slightly from in to in a significant factor in the increase in the cost of sales percentage was the unfavorable effect of a stronger canadian dollar on the costs associated with our canadian based satcom division 
these increases were somewhat offset by cost savings resulting from selective staff reductions at satcom 
sg a  as a percentage of net sales  increased in to from in  mainly due to an increase in the level of selling and marketing expenses in support of sales growth opportunities at lxe 
an additional factor in the sg a growth was the weaker us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the euro  which raised the reported us dollar equivalent of sg a expenses incurred in the canada based satcom division and in lxe s international subsidiaries 
the effect of these expense increases was offset somewhat by selective staff reductions at satcom 
r d expenses increased due to development initiatives such as the win t program at d ss and rfid technology at lxe 
the most significant element of non operating income for was a  pre tax gain for the sale of non operating real estate adjoining our facility in montreal that occurred in march in and  we reported net foreign currency losses of  and  respectively  which were mainly the result of a weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar 
interest expense increased to million from million  resulting from interest rate increases  as well as approximately  of bank fees associated with the extension of our previous revolving loan agreement and the new revolving credit loan initiated in december the effective income tax rate was in and  reflecting a comparable relative proportion of earnings at our canada based satcom division  which is subject to a much lower effective income tax rate than in the us and other jurisdictions due to tax benefits from research related expenditures

orders for long term defense contracts slowed at the end of as a result of delayed funding by the us department of defense due to budgetary delays 
net sales increased in as compared with due to strong orders growth for long term defense contracts which resulted in a record backlog of defense orders at the end of  totaling almost million 
net sales in also reflected greater activity for non defense orders as compared to the previous year 
the cost of sales percentage remained relatively unchanged for years ending december   and lxe net sales increased by million in from this growth in net sales was mainly due to an increase in product shipments for both the us and international markets  which we attribute to market acceptance of our latest product offerings especially vehicle mounted computer models that incorporate the windows ce 
net operating system 
fluctuations in exchange rates for the euro and other foreign currencies compared with the us dollar also influenced the increase in international net sales 
net sales for our lxe segment increased to million in from million in we believe the growth over this period was due to the continued expansion of our product line of rugged computers for logistics  and the introduction of new partner and service programs 
additionally  we believe that our products marketability in europe and other international markets has benefited from an improved competitive environment and a weakening us dollar over the periods presented 
of 
table of contents cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively stable for the three years ended december  sg a expenses increased significantly in as compared with the previous year due to an increased investment in sales and marketing expenditures in international markets  higher domestic administrative expenses to support the continued growth in product sales in the americas  and increased domestic selling expenses as a result of higher sales volumes 
in addition  sg a expenses increased in due to the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
satcom net sales in increased by compared with as the division achieved two quarterly net sales records in net sales increased in due to continued growth in high speed data aeronautical terminals reflecting growth in the military markets  and strong sales of new aeronautical products introduced in the second half of the year 
satcom s net sales declined in as compared with due primarily to strong net sales in resulting from favorable timing of orders near the end of the year 
on a normalized basis  we believe that our satcom division has shown continued sales growth over the previous three fiscal years 
most of this growth has been due to growth in unit sales of high speed data aeronautical and land mobile portable terminals 
these terminals are typically installed on executive jets and on military aircraft and vehicles for senior us military commanders 
the cost of sales percentage increased over the years  and due to the continued weakening of the us dollar compared with the canadian dollar 
this foreign exchange trend resulted in increased reported costs for our canada based satcom division relative to sales from its customer agreements  most of which were denominated in us dollars 
ems wireless net sales for increased by as compared with  due to substantial orders placed by several us wireless service providers  and one in particular  for our next generation antenna products which were needed to expand and upgrade their network coverage footprints 
for  net sales decreased from the preceding year due to lower capital spending by our customers  which we believe related to uncertainty during a period of consolidation in the telecommunications industry 
however  the decrease in antenna sales was partly mitigated by substantial growth in sales of repeaters  which set a new record in net sales of antennas manufactured by our brazilian subsidiary were also higher in compared with  reflecting a period of build out activity for wireless service providers in latin american markets 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased in compared with  due to an unusually high volume of net sales of a newly introduced model of antenna that had a higher cost of sales percentage than our traditional product line  and a related increase in warranty expense 
in addition  royalty fees were higher as a technology license was purchased to produce the new remote electrical down tilt antenna that was released in the second quarter of the cost of sales percentage increased slightly in compared with  due to additional engineering and manufacturing costs associated with the roll out of our new antenna product in discontinued operations in the third quarter of  and in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a formal plan to sell our space technology montreal division  and our satellite network operations  respectively 
as a result  we have accounted for these divisions as discontinued operations space technology montreal through its date of disposition  and satnet for all periods presented  and have classified their net assets as assets held for sale 
on november   we completed the sale of the assets and operating liabilities of our space technology montreal division to mda for approximately million in cash 
additional payments may be received in future years depending on the extent to which contractual in orbit incentives are earned under the contract governing s t montreal s role as payload subcontractor to mda on the canadian radarsat satellite program 
the transaction also eliminated a previous contractual requirement that the company post approximately million to secure in orbit incentive performance of the radarsat payload  but the company remains liable for that amount in the event of specified in orbit payload failures 
the company recorded a net after tax gain of  from the disposal of these operations in see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also as part of the agreement to sell the net assets of s t montreal  the company released the purchaser  mda  from a corporate guarantee  resulting in the company accruing a million long term liability 
this liability represents the company s estimated loss under a previous agreement to acquire a sub license from mda for million in payments over a six year period  which would entitle the company to receive a portion of the satellite service revenues from a specific market territory over the same period 
mda had previously guaranteed that the revenues derived under the sub license would equal or exceed the acquisition cost of the sub license  however  without the guarantee  the company currently estimates that its portion of the satellite service revenues will be less than the acquisition cost  and the company has accordingly accrued a net long term liability 
of 
table of contents on march   we completed the sale of the assets and operating liabilities of our satnet division to advantech 
in addition to advantech s assumption of trade payables  liabilities under existing satnet contracts and other specified liabilities  the agreement provides for the payment of aggregate consideration in the amount of  consisting of cash in the amount of  of which  had been previously paid and an interest bearing note of advantech in the initial principal amount of  the note is to be repaid in three equal annual installments commencing in may see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the pre tax results from our discontinued operations was a loss of million 
this loss includes impairment charges of million and million for our space technology montreal and satnet divisions  respectively  in to reflect the revised estimate of the fair value  less cost to sell  of these divisions 
the loss also reflected cost increases on certain long term contracts at our s t montreal division and lower than expected net sales by our satnet division 
in addition  the results from these canada based discontinued operations were adversely affected by a weaker us dollar compared with the canadian dollar  which increased the reported costs of satnet s operations relative to sales under its customer agreements  most of which were denominated in us dollars 
the million pre tax loss from discontinued operations in related to two significant factors affecting the space technology montreal division two large commercial space contracts experienced combined losses of million due to engineering and supplier difficulties  and we recorded an additional million charge to write down the value of assets held for sale to their estimated fair value  less costs to dispose 
the million pre tax loss from discontinued operations in reflected approximately million of losses for space technology montreal from additional costs and reserve provisions for legacy commercial space programs  and additional costs of downsizing 
also significant in were a million charge to write down the space technology montreal assets to estimated fair value  less costs to sell  and a million loss related to the disposal in of a small us based product line that had been accounted for as discontinued operations 
of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources during  net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million  primarily as a result of our earnings from continuing operating activities and an increase in payables  partially offset by an increase in receivables from higher sales at ems wireless  satcom and lxe 
net cash used in operating activities in discontinued operations was million mainly due to the loss from discontinued operations and a decrease in payables 
we received million in cash upon the sale of s t montreal  which has been included in cash flows from investing activities 
total debt decreased by million during the twelve months ended december  on february   the company amended its us and canadian revolving credit agreements to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity from million to million  and to add another financial institution in the us and in canada to the group of creditors in the agreements 
under this amendment  the aggregate borrowing capacity of the revolving credit agreements was million in both the us and canada 
the new us revolver facilities are secured by substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the company  with certain exceptions for real estate that secures existing mortgages and other permitted liens 
the new agreements mature in december interest under both the us and the canadian revolving loans are  at the company s option  a function of either the bank s prime rate or libor 
a commitment fee equal to 
per annum of the daily average unused credit in both the us and canada is payable quarterly 
these credit facilities also restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends 
the sale of the s t montreal division resulted in repayment of million of our canadian credit facility 
thereafter  amounts available for borrowing under the canadian facility were reduced by million  but the credit available under the company s us facility was increased by an equal  offsetting amount 
we are no longer required to maintain an aggregate reserve of million in unused revolving credit and cash related to a s t montreal contract 
at december   the company had million available for borrowing in the us and million available for borrowing in canada under the respective revolving credit agreements after current borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
subsequent to the end of the year  the company repaid all of its million of borrowings under its us and canadian revolving credit facilities from the million in proceeds from the sale of  initial shares and  over allotment shares of its common stock in a public stock offering in february the company invested the remaining proceeds from its stock offering along with the million received from the closing of the satnet sale on march  in a government obligations money market fund 
this reduction in the company s overall debt should reduce our interest expense in the future  and allow us to more readily meet our debt covenants 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
upon the closing of the sale of our satnet division  the amounts available for borrowing under the canadian credit facility were reduced by million 
as of the date of this filing  the company had a million borrowing capacity under its us revolving credit facility  and a million borrowing capacity under its canada revolving credit facility and no borrowings were outstanding under either facility 
the company expects that capital expenditures in will range from million to million 
these expenditures will be used primarily to purchase equipment that increases or enhances capacity and productivity 
management believes that cash provided from operations  the proceeds from the sale of its recent public stock offering  and borrowings available under our credit agreements will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the operating and capital expenditure needs for existing operations during the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has million of standby letters of credit to satisfy performance guarantee requirements under certain customer contracts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
while these obligations are not normally called  they could be called by the beneficiaries at any time before the expiration date should we fail to meet certain contractual requirements 
the company has an additional million of standby letters of credit outstanding under another canadian bank to secure a revolving credit facility for one of its foreign location 
the company has deposited million at a canadian bank as collateral for a portion of these standby letters of credit  of 
table of contents which is classified as restricted cash on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
most of this cash will become available to the company by the middle of as the underlying letters of credit expire or are settled 
at december   the company had million available for borrowing in the us and million available for borrowing in canada under the respective revolving credit agreements after current borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
as a result of the closing of the sale of its s t montreal division  the company agreed to pay half to a maximum of million of the potential liability to satisfy grievance claims arising from previously severed employees of s t montreal who claim to have received insufficient severance payments  and half to a maximum of  of any increase in the accrued pension benefit obligation of the post retirement medical plan from december  to december  in addition  an existing contractual requirement for the company to post approximately million to secure in orbit incentive performance of the radarsat payload was eliminated  but the company remains liable for that amount in the event of specified in orbit payload failures 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also as part of the agreement to sell the net assets of s t montreal  the company released the purchaser  mda  from a corporate guarantee  resulting in the company accruing a million long term liability 
this liability represents the company s estimated loss under a previous agreement to acquire a sub license from mda for million in payments over a six year period  which would entitle the company to receive a portion of the satellite service revenues from a specific market territory over the same period 
mda had previously guaranteed that the revenues derived under the sub license would equal or exceed the acquisition cost of the sub license  however  without the guarantee  the company currently estimates that its portion of the satellite service revenues will be less than the acquisition cost  and the company has accordingly accrued a net long term liability 
subsequent to december   the company closed the sale of its satnet division 
based on that agreement  the company is obligated to repurchase from advantech  at face value  the accounts receivable included in the purchased assets that have not been collected within days after the closing date  with the exception of certain identified receivables that will be repurchased at of face value if they remain uncollected days after the closing

see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
purchase commitments primarily represent existing commitments under purchase orders or contracts to purchase inventory and raw materials for our products 
most of these purchase orders and contracts can be terminated for a fee that is either fixed or based on when termination occurs 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of 
table of contents of management  and as a result  actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenue recognition for fixed price  long term contracts is a critical accounting policy involving significant management estimates by the defense space systems and satcom divisions in continuing operations  as well as the space technology montreal division in discontinued operations for periods prior to its november disposition 
long term contracts use the ratio of cost incurred to total estimated cost as the measure of performance that determines how much revenue should be recognized percentage of completion method of accounting 
cost incurred and estimates of cost to complete include overhead expenses  which are applied at a budgeted rate  the budgeted overhead rate has historically been closely comparable with the periodic actual overhead rate  but any budget versus actual rate variance during an accounting period is expensed in that period  with no effect on revenues recognized 
the determination of total estimated cost relies on engineering estimates of the cost to complete the contract  with allowances for identifiable risks and uncertainties 
if changes in engineering estimates result in an expected cost overrun ie  the estimated cost to complete exceeds the revenue to be recognized on the remainder of the contract  then revenue recognized to date will be adjusted downward  so that the revenue to be recognized on the remainder of the contract will equal the estimated cost to complete 
engineering estimates are frequently reviewed and updated  however  unforeseen problems can occur to substantially reduce the rate of future revenue recognition in relation to costs incurred 
as of december   the company had recognized a cumulative total of million in revenues from continuing operations under percentage of completion accounting  but which revenues were unbilled as of that date due to the billing milestones specified in the respective customer contracts 
net sales under cost reimbursement contracts in the defense space systems segment are recorded as costs are incurred and include an estimate of fees earned under specific contract terms 
costs incurred include overhead  which is applied at the division s customer approved rates 
fixed fees are earned ratably over the life of a contract 
incentive fees are based upon achievement of objective criteria for technical product performance or delivery milestones  although such fees may also be based upon subjective criteria for example  the customer s qualitative assessment of the company s project management 
in all cases related to incentive fee arrangements  the company does not record revenue until the fee has been earned under the terms of the contract 
net sales under all other contracts in the defense space systems and satcom segment  as well as all the company s other segments  are recognized when units are shipped or services are performed 
of 
table of contents accounting for government research incentives our accrual of research incentives from the canadian government is a critical accounting policy involving management estimates for the satnet and space technology montreal divisions in discontinued operations 
these incentives are in the form of a cash reimbursement for a portion of certain qualified research expenditures 
incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales  because the underlying research efforts primarily apply to development of technological capabilities for specific business opportunities 
for the  total incentives earned were approximately million  compared with million for we have established procedures to identify qualified costs and to submit appropriate claims for reimbursement 
all of these claims are subject to financial and scientific audits by the canadian government to determine whether certain expenses qualified for incentive programs 
although historically these audits have not resulted in significant disallowances of previously accrued incentives  such disallowances in the future would have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated statements of operations 
inventory valuation management assesses inventory valuation based upon an analysis of the aging of the inventory and assumptions that management develops concerning how the value of inventory for specific products  markets or applications may decrease over time 
inventory write downs are accounted for as adjustments to the related inventory s cost basis  and reserves are reduced only upon subsequent sale  disposal or usage of the inventory  rather than upon any subsequent improvement in the inventory aging 
evaluation of long lived assets for impairment all long lived assets on the consolidated balance sheet are periodically reviewed for impairment 
if an indication of impairment arises  we test recoverability by estimating the cash flows expected to result from the long lived assets under several different scenarios  including the potential sale of assets  as well as continued holding of the assets under several different kinds of business conditions 
no long lived assets that were classified as held and used were determined to be impaired as of december  the assets were reclassified from assets held and used to assets held for sale  for our space technology montreal through the date of its disposition  november and the satnet for all periods presented divisions due to decisions to dispose of these operations in the third quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively 
as a result  the space technology montreal and satnet divisions were accounted for as discontinued operations  and the net assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair values upon disposal 
ems recorded an impairment charge of million and million for our satnet division that was recorded in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  and additional impairment charges of million and million that were recorded in the second quarter of  and third quarter of  respectively  for our space technology montreal division 
these impairment charges were recorded to reflect the revised estimate of the fair value  less cost to sell  of these divisions based on discussions with potential purchasers 
on march   the company closed the sale of the net assets of our satnet division 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
establishment of reserves for deferred income tax assets it is management s current expectation that our canadian operations will utilize enough research related tax benefits each year to offset any canadian federal tax liability for any given year 
historically  we had reserved substantially all the net deferred tax assets associated with these research related tax benefits totaling approximately million at the end  because they are unlikely to be realized 
however  this reserve was reduced by 
million to reflect the expected future utilization of research related tax benefits following the disposition of our discontinued operations  which were unprofitable 
this reserve may be reduced further resulting in an income tax benefit to future consolidated statements of operations if our profitability in canada increases  which would increase the tax liability available to offset in future years  or the level of our qualified research in canada decreases  which would lower the tax benefits earned in future years
