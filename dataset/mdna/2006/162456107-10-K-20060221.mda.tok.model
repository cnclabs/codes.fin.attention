item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a leading marketer and manufacturer of a broad portfolio of branded otc healthcare products  toiletries and dietary supplements including such categories as topical analgesics  medicated skin care products  medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner  dietary supplements  and other otc and toiletry products 
our portfolio of products includes well recognized brands such as topical analgesics such as icy hot and aspercreme  medicated skin care products such as gold bond medicated skin care powder  cream  lotion  first aid  and foot care products  selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner  dietary supplements including dexatrim  garlique and new phase  and other otc and toiletry products such as pamprin  a menstrual analgesic  herpecin l  a lip care product  benzodent  a dental analgesic cream  and toiletries such as bullfrog  a line of sunblocks  ultraswim  chlorine removing shampoo  and sun in  a hair lightener 
our products typically target niche markets that are often outside the core product areas of larger companies where we believe we can achieve and sustain significant market penetration through innovation and strong advertising and promotion support 
many of our products are among the us market leaders in their respective categories 
for example  our portfolio of topical analgesic brands and our gold bond medicated body powders have the leading us market share in these categories 
we support our brands through extensive and cost effective advertising and promotion  the expenditures for which represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we sell our products nationally through mass merchandiser  drug and food channels principally utilizing our own sales force 
developments during fiscal products in the first quarter of fiscal  we introduced the following product line extensions aspercreme odor free therapy back and body patch  gold bond ultimate comfort powder  new phase extra strength  dexatrim max and bullfrog kids uv defender 
selsun salon was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal product divestures in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold our selsun business in certain countries in africa and asia to the mentholatum co  inc we maintain our rights to selsun elsewhere in the world except india 
the divested territory was not compatible with our strategic goals for the remainder of our international selsun operations and contributed only million in net sales in fiscal on november   we sold the phisoderm line of skin care products to the mentholatum co  inc for a purchase price of million plus inventories of approximately million 
of the million initially held in escrow subject to certain post closing conditions  only million remained in escrow as of february  the transaction allowed us to divest a brand that was no longer consistent with our brand strategy and enables us to focus our financial and management resources on our leading brands 
phisoderm generated a total of million of net sales in fiscal as a result of this transaction  we recorded a loss on product divestures of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal debt during the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due march  in the open market at an average premium of over the principal amount of the notes 
the repurchases resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in the second quarter of fiscal the outstanding balance of the remaining subordinated notes was reduced to million 
on november   we entered into the amended revolving credit facility that  among other things  increased our borrowing capacity under the facility from million to million  increased our flexibility to repurchase shares of our stock and improved our borrowing rate under the facility 
on november   we called our million of floating rate senior notes for full redemption on december  the terms of the indenture for the floating rate senior notes required the payment of a price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest 
the million of floating rate senior notes were fully redeemed on december  we utilized borrowings of million under our amended revolving credit facility and million of our cash on hand to fund the redemption of the floating rate senior notes 
as a result of the redemption  a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal litigation during fiscal  we resolved substantially all of the claims submitted in the dexatrim ppa settlement and now estimate that the total cost of the dexatrim settlement will be approximately million 
a total of million has been funded into a settlement trust by our insurers and the product manufacturer and is available to pay claims in the settlement 
any funds remaining in the settlement trust after all claims and expenses of the trust have been paid will be distributed as approved by the court in accordance with the class action settlement agreement and our settlement agreements with each of kemper indemnity insurance company and the product manufacturer 
we currently expect that after all claims and expenses of the settlement trust have been paid  we could recover up to approximately million from the settlement trust 
if realized  this potential recovery is estimated to occur in the first half of fiscal we currently do not expect to record any additional charges relative to the settlement of the ppa litigation  except for legal expenses that will be recorded in the period incurred 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred and recorded million of legal expenses related to the dexatrim litigation 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the delaco company delaco  successor by merger to the thompson medical company  inc  which owned the dexatrim brand prior to december  the delaco agreement 
pursuant to the delaco agreement  we will assume responsibility for all claims against delaco and its predecessor  thompson medical company  inc  or us relating to dexatrim products involving an injury date after december  and will hold the delaco bankruptcy estate harmless from any such claims 
in exchange  a settlement trust to be established under delaco s bankruptcy plan will pay us million and will assume responsibility for all claims related to dexatrim products alleging injury dates on or before december  the delaco agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court on july  the delaco agreement and our receipt of million from the delaco settlement trust is conditioned upon final confirmation and approval of the delaco bankruptcy plan and funding of the delaco settlement trust by the insurance companies and other parties obligated to fund the trust 
at the confirmation hearing on february   the bankruptcy court indicated that it would enter an order confirming the delaco bankruptcy plan 
absent any appeals being filed  the order confirming the plan would become final ten days after the bankruptcy court enters the order 
substantial funding of the delaco settlement trust is due to occur on or before march  counsel for delaco announced at the confirmation hearing that the effective date of the plan is anticipated to be march  on the effective date  we will be released from all liability from holders of dexatrim claims with injury dates prior to december   and if the settlement trust is funded as anticipated  we expect to receive a payment of million before the end of march management during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a separation agreement with our former president and chief operating officer 
in connection with the separation agreement  we incurred a million executive severance charge consisting of a million lump sum cash payment and a million non cash charge as a result of accelerating the vesting of restricted stock 
robert e 
bosworth was named our president and chief operating officer effective september  on november   richard d 
moss resigned from his position as vice president and chief financial officer of chattem 
robert e 
bosworth  our president and chief operating officer  who formerly served as our chief financial officer from to  will serve as our principal financial officer on an interim basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended november  as adjusted as adjusted total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative executive severance charges impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets loss on product divestures litigation settlement total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense investment and other income expense  net loss on early extinguishment of debt total other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the fiscal and consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to reflect retroactively the change in method of valuing our domestic inventory from the lifo to the fifo method adopted in fiscal our net income margin net income total revenues was  and for fiscal and  respectively 
our adjusted net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement and executive severance charges margin adjusted net income total revenues was and for fiscal and  respectively 
adjusted net income net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement and executive severance charges margin is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe that disclosure of adjusted net income margin provides investors with useful information regarding our financial performance and allows for easier comparison with net income margin without the effect of the charges in prior periods 
we use this non gaap financial measure to analyze our performance compared to forecasted and prior period results 
in addition  the fiscal consolidated statement of income has been adjusted to reflect retroactively the change in method of valuing our domestic inventory from the lifo to the fifo method adopted in fiscal a reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income for fiscal and is presented in the following table for the year ended november  dollars in thousands as adjusted net income add loss on early extinguishment of debt impairment of indefinite lived assets loss on product divestures litigation settlement executive severance provision for income taxes net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement and executive severance charges net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement and executive severance charges per common share diluted net income excluding debt extinguishment  impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement and executive severance charges margin ebitda  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  is a key non gaap financial measure used by us to measure operating performance but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the most directly comparable us generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure is net income 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda excluding impairment  loss on product divestures  litigation settlement charges and executive severance charges are used by us to supplement net income as an indicator of operating performance and not as an alternative to measures defined and required by gaap 
we consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda as well as ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda margin as important indicators of our operational strength and performance  including our ability to pay interest  service debt and fund capital expenditures 
we believe that presenting ebitda and ebitda margin  both adjusted to exclude litigation settlement and executive severance charges  provides investors with a useful measure of our ongoing operating performance 
further  ebitda adjusted to exclude litigation settlement charges is one measure used in the calculation of certain ratios to determine our compliance with the terms of our amended revolving credit facility 
our presentation of ebitda and ebitda margin  as we have adjusted such measures  should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by items similar to those excluded from the calculation of ebitda and ebitda margin  as we have adjusted such measures 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of financial performance and liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to operating income  net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flows provided by operating  investing or financing activities

the fiscal and consolidated statements of income have been adjusted to reflect retroactively the change in method of valuing our domestic inventory from the lifo to the fifo method adopted in fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use estimates 
several different estimates or methods can be used by management that might yield different results 
the following are the significant estimates used by management in the preparation of the november  consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as of november   an estimate was made of the collectibility of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate requires the utilization of outside credit services  knowledge about the customer and the customer s industry  new developments in the customer s industry and operating results of the customer as well as general economic conditions and historical trends 
when all these facts are compiled  a judgment as to the collectibility of the individual account is made 
many factors can impact this estimate  including those noted in this paragraph 
the adequacy of the estimated allowance may be impacted by the deterioration in the financial condition of a large customer  weakness in the economic environment resulting in a higher level of customer bankruptcy filings or delinquencies and the competitive environment in which the customer operates 
during the year ended november   we performed a detailed assessment of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and reduced our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million  which resulted in a decrease to selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the balance of allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at november  and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when our products are shipped to our customers 
it is generally our policy across all classes of customers that all sales are final 
as is common in the consumer products industry  customers return products for a variety of reasons including products damaged in transit  discontinuance of a particular size or form of product and shipping errors 
as sales are recorded  we accrue an estimated amount for product returns  as a reduction of these sales  based upon our historical experience and any known specific events that affect the accrual 
we charge the allowance account resulting from this accrual with any authorized deduction from remittance by the customer or product returns upon receipt of the product 
in accordance with industry practice  we allow our customers to return unsold sun care products ie bullfrog and sun in lines of products at the end of the sun care season 
we record the sales at the time the products are shipped and title transfers 
at the time of shipment  we also record a reduction in sales and an allowance on our balance sheet for anticipated returns based upon an estimated return level 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels and competitive conditions 
each percentage point change in our return rate would impact our net sales by approximately million 
during fiscal  we reduced our estimate of seasonal returns by approximately million  to a balance of million  which resulted in an increase to net sales in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal  as compared to an approximately million reduction in our estimate in fiscal and an approximately million increase in our estimate in fiscal  which resulted in an increase and decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  as a result of our estimate of customer inventory levels and based on historical non seasonal product returns  we increased our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million  to a balance of million  which resulted in a decrease to net sales in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal during fiscal and  we reduced our estimate of non seasonal returns by approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in an increase in net sales in our consolidated financial statements in fiscal and  respectively 
at november  we recorded an allowance for returns of phisoderm of million as a result of the sale of phisoderm 
we routinely enter into agreements with our customers to participate in promotional programs 
these programs generally take the form of coupons  temporary price reductions  scan downs  display activity and participations in advertising vehicles provided uniquely by the customer 
the ultimate cost of these programs is often variable based on the number of units actually sold 
estimated unit sales of a product under a promotional program are used to estimate the total cost of the program  which is recorded as a reduction of sales 
actual results can differ from the original estimate 
in addition  increases and decreases in total program commitments each year impact the accrual 
we also consider customer delays in requesting promotional program payments when evaluating the required accrual 
some customers audit programs significantly after the date of performance to determine the actual amount due and make a claim for reimbursement at that time 
as a result  changes in the unit sales trends under promotional programs as well as the timing of payments could result in changes in the accrual 
during fiscal  and  we reduced our estimate of promotional accruals by approximately million  million and million  respectively  which resulted in an increase to net sales or a decrease in advertising and promotion expense in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability 
we record income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate 
we revised our annual estimated annual effective income tax rate during fiscal to  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of the implementation of a number of foreign and state tax planning initiatives

fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage as adjusted dollars in thousands domestic net sales international revenues including royalties total revenues cost of sales advertising and promotion expense selling  general and administrative expense executive severance charges impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets loss on product divestures litigation settlement charges interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt net income the fiscal selected financial data has been adjusted to reflect retroactively the change in method of valuing our domestic inventory from the lifo to the fifo method adopted in fiscal domestic net sales domestic net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal for a description of each brand included in the following categories  see products in item of this form k 
a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands topical analgesics medicated skin care products dietary supplements medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner other otc and toiletry products total net sales growth in the topical analgesics category was led by and increases in sales of aspercreme and icy hot  respectively 
aspercreme s sales increase was driven by the launch of the odor free therapy back and body patch 
icy hot continued to benefit from the strength of the icy hot back patch and a full year of sales from the medicated sleeve 
net sales growth in this category also resulted from  and sales increases in capzasin  sportscreme and flexall  respectively 
the overall sales growth in this category was partially offset by decreased sales of arthritis hot 
net sales growth in the medicated skin care products category resulted from an increase in the gold bond franchise 
gold bond sales growth was attributable to   and increases from the lotion  powder  foot care and cream lines  respectively  and was partially offset by lost sales from our discontinued first aid and antifungal foot swab products 
the increase in sales from the gold bond lotion line of products was attributable to continued sales increases of gold bond ultimate healing lotion 
the increase in net sales of gold bond powder was driven by the launch of gold bond ultimate comfort body powder  and the sales increase of gold bond foot care products resulted from increased distribution 
although phisoderm benefited from the launch of the new pho line  this line extension was more than offset by weakness in sales and lost distribution from its acne and base skin care business 
the phisoderm brand and related inventories were sold on november  to the mentholatum co  inc net sales for the dietary supplements category improved primarily due to and increases in new phase and garlique  respectively 
net sales of new phase increased due to the introduction of new phase extra strength  and garlique sales benefited from an effective new advertising campaign 
dexatrim diet pill sales increased due to the successful launch of dexatrim max  but were offset in part by declining sales of the dexatrim all in one bar 
domestic net sales of our medicated dandruff shampoos increased  reflecting continued sales growth of selsun blue resulting from an effective advertising campaign and the launch of selsun salon in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in net sales for the other otc and toiletry products category was due primarily to sales decreases of pamprin  bullfrog and pr msyn 
the decreases in sales of pamprin and pr msyn were primarily attributable to lost distribution with a major retailer 
the decrease in sales of bullfrog was primarily attributable to unfavorable weather principally at the beginning of the suncare season and the timing and magnitude of returns in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in sales was partially offset by sales growth of sun in  ultraswim  herpecin l and benzodent 
domestic sales variances were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes with the exception of certain selected products  for which we implemented a unit sales price increase 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the introduction of icy hot in canada and strengthening distributor sales in certain european and middle eastern countries offset in part by sales declines in the uk market 
cost of sales cost of sales in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in sales volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to increases in raw materials and transportation costs  offset in part by price increases for several products 
it is anticipated that costs of sales may increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal as a result of the introduction of icy hot pro therapy and selsun salon 
advertising and promotion expense advertising and promotion expenses in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal and were of total revenues for compared to for the comparable period of fiscal support for new product introductions resulted in an increase in advertising and promotion expenditures in fiscal for dexatrim  aspercreme  gold bond powder  bullfrog  new phase and phisoderm 
the decrease in advertising and promotion expense as a percentage of total revenues was attributable to a more cost effective use of advertising expenditures and higher sales 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
an increase in sales was primarily responsible for higher selling expenses 
in addition  freight expenses increased due to higher fuel costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely a result of higher levels of product development expenses  compensation expense and insurance expense during fiscal executive severance charges during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a separation agreement with our former president and chief operating officer 
in connection with the separation agreement  we incurred a million executive severance charge consisting of a million lump sum cash payment and a million non cash charge as a result of accelerating the removal of restrictions on restricted stock 
impairment of indefinite lived assets as a result of a decline in sales and reforecasted expected future cash flows in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the impairment test as prescribed by sfas and determined that a revaluation was required for our dexatrim product line at november  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset related to this product line 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal no corresponding charge was incurred in fiscal loss on product divestures during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the phisoderm line of skin care products for a purchase price of million plus inventories of approximately million 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a loss on product divestures of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal litigation settlement charges litigation settlement items decreased million in fiscal to a gain of million from an expense of million in fiscal the change was principally due to a million reversal of previously estimated costs related to the dexatrim litigation  net of legal expenses  recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and reduced dexatrim legal and administrative costs in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease was largely the result of reductions in outstanding debt as a result of our repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes completed in the second quarter of fiscal and the remaining benefit from the debt refinancing completed during the first quarter of fiscal until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes  which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we called our million floating rate senior notes for full redemption on december  the million of floating rate senior notes were fully redeemed on december  as a result of the redemption  a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal to facilitate discussion of our operating results for the years ended november  and  we have included the following selected data from our consolidated statements of income for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage as adjusted as adjusted dollars in thousands domestic net sales international revenues including royalties total revenues cost of sales advertising and promotion expense selling  general and administrative expense impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets nm litigation settlement charges nm interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt nm net income the selected financial data has been adjusted to reflect retroactively the change in method of valuing our domestic inventory from the lifo to the fifo method adopted in fiscal domestic net sales domestic net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal for a description of each brand included in the following categories  see products in item of this form k 
a comparison of domestic net sales for the categories of products included in our portfolio of otc healthcare products is as follows for the year ended november  increase decrease amount percentage dollars in thousands topical analgesics medicated skin care products dietary supplements medicated dandruff shampoos and conditioner other otc and toiletry products total net sales growth in the topical analgesics category was led by a increase in sales of icy hot  which was primarily driven by the continued strength of the icy hot back patch and the newly introduced icy hot medicated sleeve 
net sales growth in this category also resulted from and sales increases in capzasin and aspercreme  respectively 
the overall sales growth in this category was partially offset by a decline in sales of flexall as competition from inside and outside the category increased and media support was curtailed 
net sales growth in the medicated skin care products category resulted from a increase in the gold bond franchise 
gold bond sales growth was attributable to  and increases from the lotion  foot care and cream lines  respectively  and was partially offset by declines in the first aid portion of the business 
the increase in sales from the gold bond lotion line of products was attributable to the successful launch of gold bond ultimate healing skin therapy lotion in the third quarter of fiscal sales growth in the medicated skin care products category was also offset by a decrease in phisoderm sales due to increased competition 
net sales for the dietary supplements category declined primarily due to a decrease in dexatrim diet pill sales 
sales of dexatrim were impacted by the overall decline in the diet pill market resulting in part from negative ephedrine publicity and the impact of low carbohydrate diet products 
the decline in net sales of dexatrim diet pills was partially offset by sales of the dexatrim all in one bar  which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal the dexatrim all in one bar sales were lower than expected for fiscal  as the category has proved to be more promotional and seasonal than we expected 
domestic net sales of selsun blue medicated dandruff shampoo increased due to an effective advertising campaign and sales of selsun blue conditioner  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in net sales for the other otc and toiletry products category was due primarily to sales increases of pamprin and bullfrog 
the increase in sales of pamprin was primarily attributable to the introduction of pamprin all day in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in sales of bullfrog was primarily attributable to expanded distribution and increased sales of pre pack displays 
domestic sales variances were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes with the exception of pamprin  pr msyn pms  phisoderm  flexall  aspercreme  capzasin and sportscreme  for which we implemented a unit sales price increase 
international revenues for fiscal  international revenues increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal due principally to an increase in selsun sales in canada  europe and latin america and favorable foreign currency translation 
international sales variances were principally the result of changes in unit sales volumes 
cost of sales cost of sales in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal due primarily to sales of the dexatrim all in one bar  the icy hot back patch and the icy hot medicated sleeve  all of which have lower profit margins than many of our other products 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was for both fiscal and fiscal advertising and promotion expense advertising and promotion expenses in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal and were of total revenues for compared to for fiscal support for new product introductions resulted in an increase in advertising and promotion expenditures for fiscal for icy hot  pamprin  the dexatrim all in one bar  selsun blue and the gold bond lotion and foot care lines 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
an increase in sales was primarily responsible for the higher selling expenses 
in addition  freight expenses increased due to the higher fuel costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely a result of increased incentive compensation and new product development expenses as well as expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of a decline in sales and reforecasted expected future cash flows in the fourth quarter  we performed the impairment test as prescribed by sfas and determined that a revaluation was required for our dexatrim product line at november  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset related to this product line 
as a result  we incurred an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal no corresponding charge was incurred in fiscal litigation settlement charges litigation settlement charges were million in fiscal this expense was attributable to legal  administrative and estimated settlement costs related to our dexatrim litigation 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease was largely the result of lower interest rates and a reduction in outstanding debt as a result of our debt refinancing completed during the first quarter of fiscal until our indebtedness is reduced substantially  interest expense will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during fiscal  we retired million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes and the remaining outstanding balance of our million senior secured credit facility  which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
no corresponding charge was incurred in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings 
our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses  servicing long term debt  acquisitions  working capital  repurchases of our common stock  payment of income taxes and capital expenditures 
cash of million and million was provided by operations in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt of million incurred in fiscal year compared to million incurred in fiscal increased net income  refundable income taxes and deferred income taxes also contributed to the increase in cash flow from operations 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the tax benefit realized from stock option exercises  prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the usage of cash was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our selsun business in certain countries in africa and asia in fiscal financing activities used cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash used primarily was attributable to the million repurchase of common stock in fiscal as compared to million of common stock repurchased in fiscal as of november   our total debt was million  consisting of our floating rate senior notes of million and subordinated notes of million 
as of november   we had no borrowings outstanding under our amended revolving credit facility with available borrowings up to million 
as of february   our total debt was million  consisting of borrowings outstanding under our amended revolving credit facility totaling million and million of our subordinated notes 
borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus applicable percentages of to or a base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate plus applicable percentages of to as of november  
the applicable percentages are calculated based on our leverage ratio 
the floating rate senior notes bear interest at a three month libor plus per year as of november  
on march   we entered into an interest rate cap agreement effective june  with decreasing annual notional principal amounts of million beginning march  and cap rates ranging from to over the life of the agreement 
we paid a million premium to enter into the interest rate cap agreement  which will be amortized over the life of the agreement 
the current portion of the premium on the interest rate cap agreement of million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and the long term portion of million is included in other non current assets 
during fiscal  the amortized value of the premium on the interest rate cap was compared to the fair value of the interest rate cap and the change in the market value of the premium of million  net of tax  was recorded to other comprehensive income 
also as of november   a portion of the interest rate cap was deemed to be an ineffective cash flow hedge due to the reduction of variable rate debt upon the subsequent redemption of the floating rate senior notes  resulting in a loss of million  net of tax  reflected in the income statement as interest expense 
the balance of the cash flow hedge was deemed to be effective as of november  the interest rate cap agreement terminates on march  in october  our board of directors increased the total authorization to repurchase our common stock under our stock buyback program to million  which became effective on november  upon consummation of the amended revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
we are limited in our ability to repurchase shares due to restrictions under the terms of our amended revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which the subordinated notes were issued 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balance and funds available under our amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  debt service and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future as our business is currently conducted 
it is likely that any acquisitions we make in the future will require us to obtain additional financing 
contractual obligations the following data summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  we had no commercial obligations as of november  payments due by contractual obligations total within year years years after years dollars in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase commitments endorsements total purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
foreign operations historically  our primary foreign operations have been conducted through our canadian and united kingdom uk subsidiaries 
since november   our european business has been conducted through chattem global consumer products limited  a wholly owned subsidiary located in limerick  ireland 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact operating results  including total revenues and expenses  when translations of the subsidiary financial statements are made in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
for fiscal and  these subsidiaries accounted for and of total revenues  respectively  and of total assets  respectively 
it has not been our practice to hedge our assets and liabilities in canada  the uk and ireland or our intercompany transactions due to the inherent risks associated with foreign currency hedging transactions and the timing of payments between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
following our acquisition of selsun blue  which is sold in approximately foreign countries  our international business operations have expanded significantly  which has increased our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
during fiscal  a portion of these foreign sales was reflected as royalties  which have been paid to us in us dollars 
in addition  until july abbott laboratories abbott  from whom we acquired selsun blue  continued to supply a portion of our international supply of selsun and billed us in us dollars in certain instances 
beginning april   a portion of our international supply of selsun was billed to us in local currencies 
historically  gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have not had a material impact on our operating results 
gains of million and million for the years ended november  and  respectively  resulted from foreign currency transactions and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which supersedes interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities issued in january fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie  as defined  when the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the vie s expected residual returns or both 
fin r also requires consolidation of existing  non controlled affiliates if the vie is unable to finance its operations without investor support  or where the other investors do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
fin r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january  for a vie created before february   fin r applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after march   our third fiscal quarter beginning june  application of fin r is also required in financial statements that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in determining whether to report discontinued operations eitf 
under the consensus  the approach for assessing whether cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity focuses on whether continuing cash flows are direct or indirect cash flows 
cash flows of the component would not be eliminated if the continuing cash flows to the entity are considered direct cash flows 
the consensus should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions and requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard  but we estimate the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas r will result in an expense  net of tax  of approximately million during fiscal if all current unvested stock options vest on the scheduled dates and the assumptions in the black scholes model remain the same 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note  stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
this statement is effective for our fiscal year that begins december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions to eliminate certain exceptions to the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca was enacted on october  the ajca repeals an export incentive  creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the us in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 application of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
fsp clarifies that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of ajca should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas and not as a tax rate reduction 
we have not completed the process of evaluating the impact that will result from adopting this statement and are therefore unable to disclose the impact that adopting fsp will have on our financial position and results of operations 
the fasb also issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the ajca introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
we have described the impact of fsp on our financial statements in note  income taxes 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas 
sfas no 
replaces apb no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements and establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r fsp r 
fsp r provides companies with a practical accommodation when determining the grant date of an award that is subject to the accounting provisions in sfas r 
specifically  assuming a company meets all of the other criteria in the definition of grant date in sfas r  a mutual understanding between the company and the recipient of the key terms and conditions of an award is presumed to exist at the date the award is approved in accordance with the company s normal corporate governance policy if the award is unilateral grant meaning that the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award  and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to the recipient within a relatively short period of time as defined in the fsp r after the grant was approved 
this fsp is effective upon initial adoption of sfas r on december  in november  the fasb issued fsp r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides a practical exception when a company transitions to the accounting requirements in sfas r 
sfas r requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting sfas r apic pool  assuming the company had been following the recognition provisions prescribed by sfas the fasb learned that several companies do not have the necessary historical information to calculate the apic pool as envisioned by sfas r and accordingly  the fasb decided to allow a practical exception as documented in fsp r this fsp is effective immediately

the applicable percentages are calculated based on our leverage ratio 
as of november   no amounts had been borrowed under the amended revolving credit facility  and the variable rate on the amended revolving credit facility was 
the floating rate senior notes were fully redeemed on december  utilizing million of cash on hand plus million drawn from the amended revolving credit facility 
the subordinated notes are fixed interest rate obligations 
on march   we entered into an interest rate cap agreement effective june  with decreasing annual notional principal amounts of million beginning march  and cap rates ranging from to over the life of the agreement 
the amortized value of the premium on the interest rate cap was compared to its fair value as of november   and a charge of million  net of tax  was recorded to other comprehensive income 
the interest rate cap agreement terminates on march  the impact on our results of operations of a one point rate change on the february  outstanding balance of our amended revolving credit facility for the next twelve months would be approximately million  net of tax
