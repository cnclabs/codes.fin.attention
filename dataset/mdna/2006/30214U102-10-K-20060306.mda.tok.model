table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes and valuing goodwill have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements and fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all consulting contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  such as current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections and operating plan for fiscal  we currently believe that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets 
valuing goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if certain triggering events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic trends 
when evaluating our goodwill for impairment  based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of an impairment by assessing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit  including goodwill  using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
we completed our annual impairment review as of the end of the th week of fiscal and determined that we had no impairment of our goodwill and therefore did not record an impairment charge 
as of december   goodwill totaled million

our civil engineering practice had a strong year as we assisted our clients with the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita 
in our biomechanics practice  we continued to grow our business  working with clients in their medical device development as well as in accident injury analysis 
this growth was offset by lower revenues in our technology development practice due to a decrease in the number of large projects with the united states department of defense 
our revenue growth was driven primarily by higher billing rates 
total billable hours increased to  during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal technical full time equivalents decreased to for fiscal as compared to during fiscal utilization was during fiscal and through the management of our operating expenses we were able to leverage this revenue growth to improve operating income by

table of contents result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock option plans 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this method  we generally do not recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants issued under our stock option plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense 
the paragraph entitled stock based compensation included in note to our consolidated financial statements provides the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock based awards during fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we financed our business in fiscal principally through available cash and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents and short term investments 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at the end of the prior year 
we also maintain a revolving reducing mortgage note  secured by our headquarters building 
as of december   our available borrowings under this mortgage note were million and the outstanding balance was the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in tax benefit for stock option plans offset by an increase in net income and an increase in deferred revenues 
accounts receivable increased due to an increase in revenues and higher days sales outstanding  which increased to days in fiscal as compared to days in fiscal the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to slower payment on two of our largest projects during fiscal the decrease in tax benefit for stock option plans was due to a decrease in stock option exercises 
these changes were offset by an increase in net income of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal and an increase in deferred revenues due to more pre billed fixed price projects in process at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to slower collections and a decrease in deferred revenue offset by an increase in net income 
accounts receivable related cash flow slowed as a result of higher days sales outstanding  which increased to days in fiscal as compared to days in fiscal the decrease in deferred revenue was due to fewer pre billed fixed price projects in process at the end of fiscal as compared to fiscal these changes were offset by an increase in net income of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  and  net cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase and sale or maturity of short term investments 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and an increase in common stock repurchases 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock are primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and a decrease in common stock repurchases 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs  to strategically acquire professional services firms that are complementary to our business and to pay dividends 

table of contents the following table represents the remaining authorization under our stock repurchase plans as of december  in thousands board approval date authorized repurchases repurchases to date remaining authorization february august between january  and february  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase plans for  the following schedule summarizes our principal contractual commitments as of december  in thousands fiscal year operating lease commitments capital leases purchase obligations total thereafter we have a revolving reducing mortgage note with a total available borrowing amount of million and an outstanding balance of as of february  we believe that our existing revolving note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve month period 
in addition  we believe that the funds available under the revolving reducing mortgage note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated long term cash needs beyond the next twelve month period  however  we intend to grow our business by pursuing potential acquisitions  which could increase the need for additional sources of funds over the long term 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not engage in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
the average effective maturity of our investment portfolio of short term investments and cash equivalents at december  was years 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal 
exponent has a revolving reducing mortgage note the mortgage note secured by our silicon valley headquarters building 
the mortgage note had an initial borrowing amount up to million and is subject to automatic annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed of between approximately million to million per year until january  as of december  we had 
table of contents outstanding and available borrowings of million 
as of february  our available borrowings under this note decreased to million due to the annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed 
the mortgage note is subject to two interest rate options of either prime less or the fixed libor plus with a term of one month  two months  three months  six months  nine months  or twelve months 
any borrowings under the mortgage note would expose us to some interest rate risk 
our general policy for selecting among interest rate options and related terms will be to minimize interest expense 
however  given the risk of interest rate fluctuations  we cannot be certain that the lowest rate option will always be obtained  thereby consistently minimizing our interest expense 
no sensitivity analysis was performed on our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  however  given the historical low volatility of both the prime and libor interest rates  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
