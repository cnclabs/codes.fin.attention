item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal product sales for the year ended december  increased by  to  from  in  primarily due to growth in sales of first defense 
we believe that sales of our products are influenced by the price of milk sold by our primary customers 
after declining in to price levels common in the s  the price of milk has increased 
a common index used in the industry to measure this trend is known as the class iii milk price  which indicates the value of pounds of milk sold into the cheese market 
the average class iii milk price for was per pounds  which represents a decrease from the average  but is still higher than the price level

internally developed products such as first defense tend to have higher gross margin percentages than acquired products 
a moderately lower gross margin percentage is anticipated initially as new products are developed and acquired 
over time  as these products are fully integrated into our manufacturing and selling operations  we expect to be able to improve the gross margin percentage 
this is the case  for example  with wipe out dairy wipes  a product that we acquired in december in  we invested in the necessary facility addition and production equipment required to process the wipe stock and perform the filling operations for this product internally

table of contents on any sales of mast out made by pfizer 
during the term of our license agreement  pfizer is responsible for most of the future product development and all of the marketing expenses pertaining to mast out 
nisin for wipe out dairy wipes had been produced for us under subcontract since the product s acquisition in during  we began making building modifications and fixed asset acquisitions necessary to bring the production process in house  which project was completed in for approximately  this manufacturing process was optimized during this facility was also used to produce clinical material for mast out 
the know how gained in producing nisin in our facility is being shared with pfizer  who is responsible for the production of cgmp nisin for mast out for commercial sales 
since  our strategy has been to focus our research and development efforts on animal health product opportunities  which are generally less expensive to develop than the human health product opportunities that we had worked on during the s 
we funded most of our research and development expenses principally from product sales and have been profitable for each of the seven years in the period ended december  in march  we received a two year award aggregating up to  from the maine technology institute  a non profit corporation created by the general assembly of the state of maine 
the award augmented our development of mast out 
the award was subject to a contingent payback obligation unless the product development was terminated 
because of this contingent payback obligation  the funding was recorded as deferred revenue as the cash was received  and no income was recognized to match the development expenses as they were incurred 
after pfizer assumed primary responsibility for the future development of mast out  we repaid this award in full in december our cumulative investment in research and development expenses of  for the sixteen year period ended december  has been supported  in part  by  in grant awards since not including the  award from the maine technology institute  described above 
approximately  of this grant income was recognized prior to  and  was recognized in and  is expected to be recognized in we may  on occasion  seek additional research grant support as a means of leveraging the funds that we are able to spend developing new products 
effects of inflation and interest rates  currency fluctuations we believe that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses 
significant increases in inflation or interest rates  however  could affect our customers and the demand for our products 
we hope to increase the level of our future sales of products outside the united states  and the cost of our products to foreign customers could be affected by currency fluctuations 
critical accounting policies details regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements is provided in note l to our financial statements 
the financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  contingencies and the useful lives and carrying values of intangible and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of the business and understanding our financial statements 

table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
royalty income is recorded on the accrual basis based on sales as reported to us by our licensee pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
non refundable grant income is recognized as reimbursable expenses are incurred 
indirect costs which are billed to the government are subject to their review 
all research and development costs and patent costs are expensed as incurred  except as described in the next paragraph 
in november  we capitalized a payment of approximately  made to nutrition  inc to buy out certain future milestone and royalty payment obligations  which principally resulted in a fully paid  perpetual license related to mast out 
this intangible asset is expected to be amortized over the period from november  to december  we received a  up front payment from pfizer in connection with the december product development and marketing agreement covering mast out 
we expect to recognize this revenue over the period from december  to december  both of these periods reflect management s estimate of the likely period of development before royalties could be received on sales of mast out 
the pfizer agreement  among other things  also provides for contingent milestone payments and royalties based on any future sales  subject to certain minimums 
we expect that revenue from any future milestone payments that we receive from pfizer will be recognized from the date that the milestone is achieved through december  any such milestone payments received for obtaining regulatory approvals  or after a regulatory approval is obtained  are expected to be recognized when the milestone has been reached 
should the december  estimate change  the period during which the then remaining expense and revenue are recognized would be adjusted accordingly 
any future royalty payments will be recognized as earned based on future product sales 
inventories include raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are recorded at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on the first in  first out method or market net realizable value
