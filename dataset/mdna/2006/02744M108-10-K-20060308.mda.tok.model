item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introductory overview american medical systems develops and delivers innovative medical solutions to our target patients and physicians 
since becoming an independent company in  we have worked to build a business that delivers consistent revenue and earnings growth  fueled by a robust pipeline of innovative products for significant  under penetrated markets of patients and their physicians 
we have greatly broadened our product line  building on our traditional base of products for erectile restoration and products for men s incontinence  to include products and therapies targeted at urethral stricture and benign prostatic hyperplasia in men as well as incontinence  pelvic organ prolapse and menorrhagia in women 
our primary physician customers include urologists  gynecologists  and urogynecologists

table of contents men s pelvic health products 
revenue from men s pelvic health products grew percent in  following an increase of percent in each year benefited from the july acquisition of thermatrx  inc erectile restoration product sales increased percent in  and percent in in  we experienced strong growth in our erectile restoration products in the first half of the year because the comparable period of was weak with the introduction of cialis and levitra in the us the average selling price of erectile restoration products increased percent in on a percent increase in units sold 
the increase in average selling price was due to the shift of significant volume within the ams line to the enhanced technology and correspondingly higher price of the tactile pump product  approved for use by the fda in july the increase in erectile restoration sales was also due to the broad introduction of the tactile pump product in fourth quarter 
male continence sales grew percent in and percent in unit sales in male continence grew percent and percent in and  respectively 
average selling prices in male continence grew percent in and percent in in  our male continence unit sales growth was strong because of a simplified surgical procedure and product improvements 
prostate treatment sales in  our first full year of sales from our thermatrx acquisition  increased million over sales in for prostate treatments increased million as the result of the thermatrx acquisition completed in july of that year 
excluding thermatrx sales  our prostate product sales declined million and million during and  respectively  as we continued to reposition the urolume product toward obstructive urethral conditions such as urethral stricture 
women s pelvic health products 
revenue from women s pelvic health products grew percent in  following an increase of percent in this revenue growth was the result of percent unit growth in and percent unit growth in in with our first full year of our apogee and perigee products  we experienced rapid growth in our prolapse business  changing our product mix and increasing our average women s pelvic health prices as compared to growth 
biologic versions of these products released in the fourth quarter of contributed to our million growth in prolapse products for over the monarc and bioarc to self fixating slings continued strong growth as the market continues the shift which began in from suprapubic to transobturator dominance in female incontinence slings 
the strong growth in uterine health products was the result of a favorable reimbursement decision effective january of for the her option product 
international sales and foreign exchange effects 
our consolidated revenue grew million  or percent in from of this growth  million  or percentage points  was due to favorable currency exchange rates in the markets in which we conduct business in a foreign currency 
in  million  or percentage points  of the revenue increase from was due to favorable currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
because a large share of our expenses associated with international sales are foreign currency denominated costs  changes in these currency rates do not affect net income and cash flows from operations by the same dollar amount as they affect sales revenues

table of contents cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points from to cost of goods sold improvements resulted from increased volume  process improvements generating favorable variances  favorable product mix  reduction of production set up and controlled overhead spending 
these were partially offset by an increase in royalty payments from the prior year 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from to of this increase  percentage points  or million  is due to the reduction in our warranty allowance 
partially offsetting the warranty allowance impact is the percentage point favorable impact of foreign currency 
the remaining percentage point increase in cost of goods sold is due mainly to the costs of integrating thermatrx and product mix changes  partially offset by higher production volumes 
cost of goods sold as a percent of sales has generally benefited from relatively stable overhead costs  which account for more than a quarter of our cost of goods sold 
future cost of goods sold will continue to depend on production levels  labor costs  raw material costs and product mix 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses increased in due to additional us marketing and selling personnel in support of the million increase in net sales 
the increase in from reflects the growth of our sales force and the addition of the thermatrx sales force in july of that year 
we expect to continue investing in marketing and selling in support of increasing sales levels  but expect marketing and selling expenses will slightly decrease as a percentage of sales 
research and development 
research and development includes costs to develop and improve current and possible future products plus the costs for regulatory and clinical activities for these products 
the million increase in research and development expense from to is due to our continued investment in personnel in support of applied research  product development  intellectual property support  clinical studies  and regulatory filings including those related to our ovion acquisition 
over percent of the research and development increase relates to additional personnel and expenditures in support of our july acquisition of thermatrx 
we expect total spending in research and development  over the longer term  to be in the range of to percent of sales 
in process research and development 
the in process research and development ipr d expense relates to our acquisition of ovion inc  a development stage enterprise  in july in accordance with the rules of purchase accounting  we recognized a charge of million related to the value assigned to ipr d for a permanent birth control device for women that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
we estimated the fair value of the ipr d based on the excess earnings method  using projections of expected cash inflows and outflows  including cost of goods sold  research and development expenses to complete and maintain the product  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses  taxes and incremental working capital requirements 
the ipr d expense relates to our acquisition of thermatrx  inc in july in accordance with the rules of purchase accounting  we recognized an ipr d charge of million related to the next generation thermatrx console  a transurethral microwave system to treat bph  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
this device includes updated components  new software  and a significantly updated user interface 
this device is subject to approval by the fda 
with an anticipated launch in  this capital device will replace the current capital equipment component of the thermatrx system 
we used the excess earnings method to estimate the fair value of the ipr d  using projections for incremental sales and expenses associated with the new device for the years through no incremental sales and expenses for the device are expected after  as yet to be defined products are expected to replace this device by that time 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs remained relatively constant from to as increased costs due to personnel additions were offset by decreased systems depreciation and decreased professional fees and services related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
general and administrative cost increases in compared to were primarily due to million of professional fees and services associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  million of international bad debt expense  million of legal costs related to intellectual property matters and million due to the acquisition of thermatrx 
amortization of intangibles 
the increase in intangible amortization in compared to is primarily due to the amortization of definite lived assets from the thermatrx and ovion acquisitions 
the increase in amortization expense in compared to reflects the 
table of contents amortization of definite lived assets over approximately months from the thermatrx acquisition 
for a more complete description of this change and its impact on financial results see notes to consolidated financial statements no 
other income expense royalty income 
our royalty income in is from the license of our stent delivery technology for medical use outside of urology 
this perpetual exclusive worldwide license was entered into during and is expected to continue to we receive a royalty equal to percent of net sales of licensed products on a quarterly basis 
we do not directly influence sales of the products on which this royalty is based and cannot give any assurance as to future income levels 
interest income 
the increase in interest income in reflects an increase in rates partially offset by lower cash balances in the interest bearing accounts 
cash balances declined due to the thermatrx contingent earnings payments and the consideration paid for ovion in july see notes to consolidated financial statements no 

interest income was higher in than in due to an increase in rates partially offset by lower cash balances as a result of the prepayment of the credit facility in july see notes to consolidated financial statements no 
and the initial consideration paid for thermatrx in july see notes to consolidated financial statements no 

interest expense 
interest expense decreased in due to lower borrowing levels  partially offset by the amortization of fees related to our million senior unsecured five year revolving facility line of credit secured in january the interest expense included million related to the early termination of our prior credit facility  offset by the impact of lower borrowing than in investment impairment 
in  we recognized a million loss associated with the write off of our common and preferred stock investment in injectx  a company focused on the development of ethanol ablation systems for prostate treatments 
see notes to consolidated financial statements no 
other income expense 
other expense in is due primarily to losses resulting from the fluctuation in foreign currencies  mainly the euro  against the us dollar and relate to translating foreign denominated inter company receivables to current rates 
other income in is due mainly to net gains resulting from the fluctuation in foreign currencies  similar to those described for provision for income taxes in  the effective tax rate of percent was higher than the statutory tax rate applied to taxable income primarily due to the effects of the million ipr d charge for which no related tax benefit can be recorded under purchase accounting rules 
in  the effective tax rate of percent was higher than the statutory tax rate applied to taxable income primarily due to the million ipr d charge and the million investment impairment charge  neither of which are deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million as of december   compared to million as of january  the decrease is primarily due to i the million of contingent payments on aggregate sales paid to thermatrx shareholders in and ii the net cash consideration of million paid for the ovion inc acquisition in july these decreases were partially offset by cash flow from operations 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided from operating activities increased by million in primarily as a result of an increase in net income exclusive of non cash ipr d charges of approximately million and from improvements in various working capital items of million including accounts receivable and accounts payable 
net cash provided from operating activities in increased from levels by approximately million due primarily to an increase in net income exclusive of non cash ipr d 
table of contents charges and investment write offs of approximately million and million from improvements in various working capital items including accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
during and  we purchased property  plant and equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
we had net cash payments of million in related to the acquisitions of thermatrx and ovion  and a cash payment of million related to the acquisition of thermatrx 
cash flows from financing activities cash flow from financing activities was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in cash received under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was million and million during and respectively 
payments made under the prior senior credit facility were million and million in and  respectively 
on july   we repaid the remaining balance of million under our prior senior credit facility and terminated the facility 
this facility  which was set to expire in september  was replaced with a new facility on january  the new agreement provides for a million senior unsecured five year revolving facility us dollars only  with a million sub limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit  and a million sub limit for swing line loans 
at our option  any loan under the credit agreement other than swing line loans bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or an alternative variable rate based on either prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  in each case plus a basis point spread determined by reference to our leverage ratio 
we have the option of increasing the aggregate maximum principal amount under the facility by million 
funds are available under the credit facility for working capital and other lawful purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
there were no borrowings under the facility at december  the new credit agreement contains standard affirmative and negative covenants  including the two financial covenants set forth below credit facility covenant requirements actual leverage ratio to 
to interest coverage ratio to to the covenants also restrict a the making of investments  the payment of dividends and other payments with respect to capital  the disposition of material assets other than in the ordinary course of business and mergers and acquisition if such actions would cause our leverage ratio to be greater than to  b transactions with affiliates unless such transactions are completed in the ordinary course of business and upon fair and reasonable terms  c the incurrence of liens and d substantial changes in the nature of our business 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  including  payment defaults  material inaccuracy of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  bankruptcy and involuntary proceedings  monetary judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts  cross defaults to certain other agreements  change of control and erisa defaults 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the future commitments in thousands under the senior credit facility see notes to consolidated financial statements no 
and operating leases 
less than more than in thousands total year years years years credit facility commitment fees operating lease commitments purchased inventory commitments total 
table of contents we have a commitment to purchase component parts used in the manufacture of thermatrx products 
the purchase order requires us to buy components and finished assembly product of million during the first half of we will use cash generated from operations to satisfy this commitment 
on july   we acquired thermatrx  inc at closing  the shareholders of thermatrx were initially paid cash consideration of million 
in addition to the initial closing payment  we made contingent payments based on the net product revenues attributable to sales of the acquired product 
through the end of the fourth quarter of  we accrued contingent payments to former thermatrx shareholders in the amount of million  of which million was paid and approximately million is payable in on july   we acquired ovion inc and the former shareholders of ovion received initial cash consideration of million  after certain adjustments made at closing regarding the payment of outstanding liabilities of ovion at the time of closing 
we deposited million of this initial consideration in escrow to be held for months after closing of the merger to cover certain contingencies  and the balance was distributed to former ovion shareholders 
we used cash on hand to make the initial payment of million  net of acquired cash on hand at closing of million 
we also incurred acquisition related costs of approximately million 
in addition to the initial closing payment  we will make additional contingent payments up to million  if certain clinical trial and regulatory milestones are completed  and an earn out payment equal to net sales for a month period after commercialization 
in addition  the ovion founders will receive a two percent royalty related to their initial technology contribution to ovion 
this transaction is more fully described in our form k filed with the sec on july  and in notes to consolidated financial statements no 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with our balances in cash and cash equivalents along with funds available under our senior credit facility  will be sufficient to finance current operations  planned capital expenditures  and commitments to former thermatrx and ovion shareholders through the terms of these agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  warranty  legal contingencies  and income taxes 
the critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
approximately percent of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory or from inventory with field representatives 
for these products  revenue is recognized at the time the product has been used or implanted 
for all other transactions  we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  providing there are no remaining performance obligations required from us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
in cases where we utilize distributors or ship product directly to the end user  we recognize revenue upon shipment provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we record estimated sales returns  discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the sale period revenue is recognized 
all of our customers have rights of return for the occasional ordering or shipping error 
we maintain an allowance for these returns and reduce reported revenue for expected returns from shipments during each reporting period 
this allowance is based on historical and current trends in product returns 
at december  this allowance was million  and it was million at january  allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing those accounts receivable that have reached their due date and by applying rates based upon historical write off trends and specific account reserves 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of bankruptcy or other 
table of contents circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
when it is deemed probable that a customer account is uncollectible  that balance is written off against the existing allowance 
different estimates could have material variances in the amount and timing of our reported results for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and at january   was million 
the allowance remained at this level on increased sales due to improved collection activities in both us and international operations 
in particular  allowances required on open accounts in spain and portugal have decreased through more aggressive monitoring of hospital payment patterns and resulting collection activities 
the allowance was percent and percent of gross accounts receivable at the end of and  respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on the first in first out method 
each quarter  we evaluate our inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical loss trends  expected product lives  product at risk of expiration  sales levels by product  and projections of future sales demand 
we reserve inventories we consider obsolete 
in addition  we record an allowance for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the reduction reflects enhanced inventory management practices 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current estimates  additional inventory adjustments would be required and would adversely affect income in the period the adjustment is made 
warranty accrual allowance we warrant all of our products to be free from manufacturing defects 
in addition  if a product fails  we may provide replacements at no cost or at a substantial discount from list price 
we maintain a warranty allowance to cover the cost of replacements for our erectile restoration  incontinence  bph  and menorrhagia products 
when we sell products  we record an expense for the expected costs of future warranty related claims  and increase the warranty allowance by an equivalent amount 
we reduce the warranty allowance by the cost of the replacement device when an actual claim is awarded 
thus  the balance of the warranty allowance is an estimate of the future cost of honoring our warranty obligation 
factors influencing this estimate include historical claim rates  changes in product performance  frequency of use by the patient  the patient s performance expectations  and changes in the terms of our product replacement policy 
product reliability is a function of raw material properties  manufacturing processes  and surgical technique 
during  we noted a significant decrease in warranty claims  following the trend from the prior year 
with further investigation  we concluded this continuing decrease was the result of improvements in the quality and durability of our products and changes in our claims processing 
because we expected these trends to affect warranty claims for the foreseeable future  we determined that the warranty allowance should be reduced by approximately million 
the adjustment was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold and as an increase to reported operating income and net income 
at december   our accrued warranty allowance was million compared to million at january  if we experience further changes in any of the factors that influence this estimate  we will make additional adjustments to this accrued warranty allowance 
product liability accrual each quarter  we estimate the uninsured portion of legal representation and settlement costs of product liability claims and lawsuits 
this evaluation consists of reviewing historical claims costs as well as assessing future trends in medical device liability cases 
social and political factors  as well as surgeon and medical facility responsibility  make litigation costs hard to predict 
accruals for future litigation costs were million at december   versus million at january  the accrual amount reflects the estimate related to identified claims and lawsuits 
if  in the future  we determine that this accrual is inadequate  the adjustment would reduce reported income in the period we recorded the adjustment 

table of contents operating leases we lease certain operating equipment  primarily automobiles  with terms of generally three years 
at the inception of the lease  terms are evaluated to determine whether benefits and risks of ownership have been transferred from the lessor  through bargain purchase options  lease terms greater than or more of the estimated economic life of the equipment  transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or a present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term of or more of the fair value of the equipment 
as none of these factors exist in our lease arrangements  our leases are recorded as operating leases  with monthly rental payments charged to expense as the payments become due 
valuation of ipr d  goodwill and other intangible assets when we acquire another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between in process research and development ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets  and goodwill as required by us gaap 
ipr d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for ipr d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including ipr d  of acquired businesses 
we assess goodwill impairment indicators quarterly  or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  and million as of january  other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  patents  and trademarks and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we review these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december  and million as of january  income taxes in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate are estimated 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and then valued accordingly 
we evaluate the realizable value of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly and yearly basis  as well as assess the need for valuation allowances by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when we believe all or part of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances for and of million and million  respectively  are maintained to offset tax loss carry forwards created in a foreign jurisdiction  million of which  if subsequently recognized  would be allocated to goodwill 
in addition  in a million valuation allowance was established for the capital loss carry forward related to the investment impairment see notes to consolidated financial statements no 

no other allowances against net deferred tax assets are maintained at december  if a determination is made that we would not realize all or part of the deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a charge to income in the period of the determination would be made 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements see notes to consolidated financial statements no  recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we do not believe that the interest rate risk on earnings is material given our level of investments and their short term nature 
also  we do not believe that the interest rate risk on borrowings is material given we currently have no debt outstanding 
interest rate risk will increase at such time as we borrow funds 
currency our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency 
all assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated to us dollars at period end exchange rates 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and short term inter company receivables from foreign subsidiaries are included in other income expense 
during fiscal and  revenues from sales to customers outside the united states were percent and percent of total consolidated revenues  respectively  and international accounts receivable  inventory  cash  and accounts payable were percent  percent  percent  and percent of total consolidated accounts for each of these items as of december  the reported results of our foreign operations will be influenced by their translation into us dollars by currency movements against the us dollar 
the result of a uniform percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar in fiscal relative to each of the currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would have been a decrease in net income of approximately million during at december   our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the period end exchange rate was million and the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar currency exchange rate amounts to million 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years and periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future
