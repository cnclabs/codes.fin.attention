see risk factors 
overview we are a biotechnology company specializing in the sequencing  or detailed structural analysis  and design of complex sugars for the development of improved versions of existing drugs  the development of novel drugs and the discovery of new biological processes 
we are also utilizing our ability to sequence sugars to create technology enabled generic versions of sugar based and complex drug products 
through detailed analysis of the molecular structure of complex sugars  we believe our proprietary technology enables us to define the specific sugar sequences contained in complex sugar based drugs  including those structures that had previously not been described due to a lack of available technology 
in addition  we are able to derive a more complete understanding of the roles that sugars play in cellular function  disease and drug action based on our analytical capabilities 
with our capabilities  we have developed a diversified pipeline of near term product opportunities and novel discovery and development candidates 
our business strategy is to utilize revenue realized from applying our technology to near term product opportunities  such as m enoxaparin and generic versions of other complex mixtures  as a funding source for our development and discovery programs 
over the long term  we expect to generate value by leveraging our understanding of sugars to create novel therapeutics which address critical unmet medical needs in a wide range of disease areas  including oncology  cardiovascular disease  inflammation and immunology 
our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a technology enabled generic version of lovenox  a widely prescribed low molecular weight heparin  or lmwh 
we have formed a collaboration with sandoz nv and sandoz inc  collectively sandoz  affiliates of novartis ag  to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin 
in accordance with our collaboration with sandoz  an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  was submitted for m enoxaparin on august  since our inception in  we have incurred annual net losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we recognized net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses as we develop our product candidates  expand our research and development activities and prepare for the commercial launch of our product candidates 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
our revenues for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  were derived from our collaboration agreement with sandoz and primarily consist of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for m enoxaparin 
on june   we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriters discounts and expenses 
in july we raised million in a follow on public offering  net of expenses  from the sale and issuance of  shares of our common stock 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our product candidates 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in which we compete are undergoing  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant technological change 
we expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made or new biotechnology products are introduced 
to become and remain profitable  we must succeed in developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential 
this will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities for which we are only in the preliminary stages developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approval for them  and manufacturing  marketing and selling them 
we have invested a significant portion of our time  financial resources and collaboration efforts in the development of our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin 
our successful development and commercialization of m enoxaparin  in collaboration with sandoz  depends on several factors  including using our technology to demonstrate successfully to the fda that m enoxaparin is therapeutically equivalent to lovenox  meeting any other fda requirements for marketing approval  successfully manufacturing m enoxaparin in a consistent and reproducible manner and at a commercial scale  manufacturing m enoxaparin cost effectively  achieving a favorable outcome of potential litigation with sanofi aventis relating to enoxaparin  if any  and achieving market acceptance of m enoxaparin in the medical community and with third party payors 
financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any revenue from product sales and are uncertain whether or not we will generate any revenue from the sale of products over the next several years 
we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our collaboration agreement with sandoz 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  contract research and manufacturing  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
the following summarizes our primary research and development programs development programs m enoxaparin our most advanced product candidate  m enoxaparin  is designed to be a generic version of lovenox 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of dvt  and treatment of acs 
we have formed a collaboration with sandoz to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m enoxaparin 
under our collaboration agreement  sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the m enoxaparin development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
the total cost of development and commercialization and the timing of bringing m enoxaparin to market is subject to uncertainties relating to the development  regulatory approval and legal processes 
in accordance with our collaboration agreement with sandoz  an anda was submitted to the fda for m enoxaparin on august   seeking approval to market m enoxaparin in the united states 
we anticipate that the fda s review of the m enoxaparin anda will require  among other things  a review of our technology and characterization methodology  as well as our manufacturing data 
in parallel  momenta  in collaboration with sandoz  is focused on activities related to supporting the anda submission and the fda s review of the anda and preparing for the commercialization of m enoxaparin  if and when approved  including advancing manufacturing  supply chain  sales and marketing objectives 
m m is a lmwh that we rationally designed to provide improved clinical properties to treat patients with acs 
in november  we initiated efforts to develop a more efficient and reproducible manufacturing process 
those efforts have resulted in a new process with greater yield and reproducibility at a reduced cost  as compared to the prior manufacturing process 
in september  we initiated glp toxicology and pharmacology studies for m intended to support our ind 
we expect that additional expenditures will be required to complete preclinical testing 
if such preclinical testing is successful  we intend to file an ind in mid and begin phase i clinical trials shortly thereafter  if the ind goes into effect 
because m is in preclinical development  we are not currently able to estimate the cost to complete the research and development phase nor are we able to estimate the timing of commercialization of m other complex mixture drugs we are exploring the application of our technology to the analysis of other complex mixture drugs beyond heparins 
certain drug products exist as complex mixtures 
in addition to heparins  complex mixtures include synthetic  semi synthetic and naturally derived products and are composed of molecules that  due to their diversity  are difficult to fully characterize 
drugs which are complex mixtures can be approved and regulated under either the new drug application  or nda  or biological licensing application  or bla  regulatory paths at the fda 
some complex mixture products  such as estrogen products  peptide mixtures  and botanical drug products  have been approved as ndas 
however  many other complex mixture products have been approved as bla products  including glycoproteins such as erythropoietin  blood clotting factors  and interferon beta 
we are seeking to apply our technology to complex mixture products irrespective of the regulatory path under which each product was approved 
for complex mixtures approved as ndas  we are applying our characterization technology to develop technology enabled generic products 
we have identified a candidate for this strategy and are currently refining the characterization data and process development work 
we continue to advance our discussions for this complex mixture product with potential strategic partners 
for complex mixtures approved as blas  such as glycoproteins  we are applying our technology to characterize and better understand these molecules 
product applications include working with innovator biotechnology companies to help them better understand the sugars contained in their products  applying our technology to create technology enabled follow on generic glycoproteins  leveraging strategies similar to those of m enoxaparin  and creating improved versions of glycoprotein products 
m dalteparin m dalteparin is targeted to be a technology enabled generic version of fragmin  a lmwh product 
fragmin is indicated for the prevention of dvt and selected indications in acs 
in september  eisai inc  a us pharmaceutical subsidiary of eisai co 
ltd  obtained us promotion rights to fragmin from pfizer inc fragmin is marketed by pfizer in europe and by kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in japan 
similar to lovenox  fragmin is currently described by limited measures such as molecular weight distribution  anti xa activity and anti iia activity 
we believe that additional analysis is necessary to demonstrate that a generic version of fragmin has the same active ingredients as the branded drug 
through our technology  we believe we have the ability to analyze fragmin and demonstrate that our generic product has the same active ingredients as fragmin  thereby enabling the fda to approve an anda for dalteparin 
in november  we reprioritized the m dalteparin program in light of other more commercially attractive opportunities 
we have reduced our internal resources for m dalteparin while we assess our options to pursue commercialization and partnering of the product 
the total cost of development and commercialization and the timing of bringing m dalteparin to market are subject to uncertainties relating to the market growth for fragmin  as well as the development  regulatory and legal approval processes 
discovery programs we are also applying our analytical capabilities for complex sugars to several discovery programs  including a drug delivery program and an oncology program 
through our drug delivery program  we have identified a mechanism by which sugars facilitate the transport of drugs across mucosal membranes  enabling the delivery of larger proteins and leading to higher levels of bioavailability  or levels of drug in the blood 
we believe this sugar mediated transport mechanism can be applied to a variety of marketed drugs and drug candidates 
while our current focus is on the pulmonary delivery of therapeutic proteins where achieving adequate bioavailability has been a challenge  the technology has potentially broad application to the delivery of other drugs across other mucosal membranes 
a second discovery program is focused on the role that complex sugars play in biological systems  including regulating the development and progression of disease 
our initial focus is in cancer  which is a disease characterized by unregulated cell growth 
sugars play a part in the conversion of normal cells into cancerous cells  the regulation of tumor growth  and tumor invasion and metastasis 
we believe that our technology can provide us with a better understanding of the role of sugars in disease  which we hope will enable us to discover novel sugar therapeutics  as well as to discover new disease mechanisms that can be targeted with small molecule or antibody drugs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we anticipate additional increases in general and administrative expenses to support our research and development programs 
these increases will likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
we intend to continue to incur increased internal and external legal and business development costs to support our various product development efforts  which can vary from period to period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for was million  compared with million for  and million for the increase of million from to and million from to is attributable to our collaboration agreement with sandoz signed in november these revenues include amortization of an initial payment made to us by sandoz and amounts earned for research and development services and other reimbursable costs 
the increases are due to increased research activity as described below 
research and development research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in personnel and related costs  million in manufacturing and research provided by third parties  million in facilities costs  million in lab supplies  million in consultant costs  million in depreciation expense and million in recruiting and relocation costs 
the increase of million from to principally resulted from an increase of million in manufacturing and research provided by third parties and million in personnel and related costs 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenses for our principal research and development programs for the years ended december    and research and development in thousands development programs discovery programs other research total research and development expense the increases in development program expenses from to and from to were primarily due to the increased personnel and manufacturing costs of the m enoxaparin program 
the increase from to also included increased personnel and manufacturing expenses for the m program 
the increases in discovery program expenses from to and from to were primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs in drug delivery and oncology 
the increase in other research in both periods was primarily due to increases in personnel and related costs for research benefiting our technology platform or multiple programs 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in for development  discovery and other research programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense increased by million from to due primarily to an increase of million in professional fees  including legal  consulting  accounting and other professional fees  million in personnel and related costs  million in insurance and million in office and computer supplies 
in compared to general and administrative expense increased by million due primarily to an increase of million in personnel costs  million in professional fees  including consulting and accounting fees  million in stock compensation expense  million in insurance costs and million in facilities costs 
interest income interest income was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of our follow on public offering in july the increase of million from to was primarily due to higher average investment balances as a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in june interest expense interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to additional amounts drawn from our equipment line of credit during liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our collaboration agreement with sandoz  borrowings from our lines of credit  and a capital lease obligation 
since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in june  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have received million from our sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations and additional funds from interest income 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in addition  we hold million in restricted cash which serves as collateral for a letter of credit related to our facility lease 
during the years ended december   and  our operating activities used million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of net losses associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop and maintain our administrative infrastructure 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
during  we used million of cash to purchase marketable securities  offset by cash provided of million in maturities of marketable securities 
we used million of cash in to purchase marketable securities 
during the years ended december   and  we used million  million and million respectively  to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements 
for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million  reflecting the net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering in july in addition  we borrowed an additional million under our line of credit facility set up in and we received million under a sale leaseback arrangement being treated as a capital lease in december the arrangement allows for the sale and leaseback of an additional million in capital equipment through december for the year ended december   our financing activities provided million  reflecting the net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in june  and the issuance of our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
in addition  in december  our initial line of credit with a bank provided million in proceeds 
payments on our line of credit totaled million in in  million was provided by financing activities  primarily due to net proceeds of million from our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock and proceeds from a line of credit of million  offset by line of credit payments of million 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total through through after license maintenance obligations short and long term line of credit obligation capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations after  the annual obligations  which extend indefinitely  are approximately million per year 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
funding requirements during and  we have cumulatively received million from our collaboration with sandoz 
under our collaboration with sandoz  sandoz has agreed to fund a minimum amount of personnel and substantially all of the other ongoing development  commercialization and legal expenses incurred with respect to our m enoxaparin program  subject to the right to terminate if certain costs exceed mutually agreed upon limits 
we expect to use our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to continue the development of our product candidates  our discovery research programs and for other general corporate purposes 
we intend to use the majority of our cash to fund our development programs  including m enoxaparin  m  m dalteparin and the application of our technology to other complex mixtures including glycoproteins  and non sugar based complex mixtures 
also we will use funds to advance our discovery programs  which are focused on identifying novel therapeutics and technologies  the potential acquisition of companies  products and technologies that complement our business  and working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
we expect to incur substantial costs and losses as we continue to expand our research and development activities 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the advancement of our generic product candidates and other development programs  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborators  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the continued progress in our research and development programs  including completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the potential acquisition and in licensing of other technologies  products or assets  the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our product candidates  the cost of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities  if any  and the cost of litigation  including potential patent litigation 
we do not expect to generate significant additional revenues  other than payments that we receive from our collaboration with sandoz or other similar future collaborations  until we successfully obtain marketing approval for  and begin selling  m enoxaparin 
we believe the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize m enoxaparin  the success of our development programs  including our generic product candidates and programs involving preclinical and clinical development  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  and our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations with corporate and academic collaborators and the success of such collaborations 
if our existing resources  including the proceeds of our initial public offering and july follow on offering are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we acquire or license additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy  we may need to raise additional external funds through the sale of equity or debt securities 
the sale of equity securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  accrued expenses and certain equity instruments 
prior to our ipo  we also evaluated our estimates and judgments regarding the fair valuation assigned to our common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved 
contract revenues are recorded as the services are performed 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue should be recognized is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the collaborative agreement 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs  which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
in  and  certain grants of stock options were made at exercise prices deemed to be less than the fair value of our common stock and  as a result  we recorded deferred stock compensation expense 
in the notes to our financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas we account for transactions in which services are received from non employees in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received or of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured  in accordance with sfas and the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas and eitf requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be over or under stated 
equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and the value of those goods or services cannot be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees and non employees 
we estimated the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors which we deemed to be relevant at the time 
because shares of our common stock had not been publicly traded prior to our ipo  market factors historically considered in valuing stock and stock option grants included comparative values of public companies discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares we were issuing  pricing of private sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants and the effect of events that had occurred between the time of such grants  economic trends  and the comparative rights and preferences of the security granted compared to the rights and preferences of our other outstanding equity 
prior to our ipo  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors 
in the absence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights and voting control attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock and  primarily  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale of momenta 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be expensed based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june   irrespective of the entity s fiscal year 
early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we adopted statement r on january  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods i the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date or ii a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has adopted the modified prospective method when applying statement r 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options granted at fair value 
accordingly  the adoption of the statement r fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss per share as noted in footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
the company currently expects stock option expense for to be in a range of million to million dependent upon assumptions used in estimating the fair value  market prices and levels of share based payments granted in any changes from current assumptions could result in significant variation from the company s current estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount
