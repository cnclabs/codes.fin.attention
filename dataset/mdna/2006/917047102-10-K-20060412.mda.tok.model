item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly results for additional information 
item a 
risk factors our business segments are sensitive to economic conditions  consumer spending  shifts in fashion and industry and demographic conditions 
we are subject to seasonal variations and face numerous business risk factors 
consumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products  including our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there is a risk that consumer sentiment may decline due to economic and or geo political factors  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
we rely heavily on our ability to identify changes in fashion 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
our inability to reasonably determine these changes may lead to higher seasonal inventory levels and a future need to increase markdowns to liquidate our inventory 
compared to our retail segments  our wholesale business is more sensitive to changes in fashion trends because of longer lead times in the manufacture and sale of its apparel 
while we do not plan for mistakes in our fashion offering selections  our fashion decisions constitute a material risk and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new retail stores 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores on a profitable basis 
our operating complexity will increase as our store base grows  and we may face challenges in managing our future growth 
such growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our operating capabilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may be unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified personnel or successfully manage our growth 
our expansion prospects also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things  competition  the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements  the availability of suitable sites for new store locations on acceptable lease terms  and the availability of inventory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals  nor can there be any assurance that our newly opened stores will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if our stores fail to achieve  or are unable to sustain  acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores 

table of contents existing and increased competition in the specialty retail  direct to consumer and wholesale apparel businesses may reduce our net revenues  profits and market share 
the specialty retail  direct to consumer and the wholesale apparel businesses are each highly competitive 
our retail stores compete on the basis of  among other things  the location of our stores  the breadth  quality  style  and availability of merchandise  the level of customer service offered and merchandise price 
our anthropologie and free people stores also face competition from small boutiques that offer an individualized shopping experience similar to the one we strive to provide to our target customers 
in addition  some of our suppliers offer products directly to consumers and certain of our competitors 
our free people wholesale business competes with numerous wholesale companies based on the quality  fashion and price of our wholesale product offerings  many of whose products have wider distribution than ours 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition as well as financial  marketing and other resources 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
we believe that we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives  including our chairman  president and co founder  richard a 
hayne  and the president of anthropologie  inc  glen t 
senk 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects  as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
hayne  mr 
senk or any of our other key personnel 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future at costs that are favorable to us  or at all  could impair our ability to increase revenue and could otherwise harm our business 
we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution centers are shut down 
we operate three distribution facilities worldwide to support our retail and wholesale business segments in the united states  western europe and canada  and for fulfillment of catalog and web site orders 
we have also engaged a third party to operate an additional distribution facility to service our stores in the western united states and utilize a portion of the toronto urban outfitters store as a wholesale distribution facility in canada 
the merchandise purchased for our retail and wholesale operations is shipped directly to our distribution center in lancaster county  pennsylvania and merchandise purchased for our direct to consumer operations is shipped directly to our distribution center in trenton  south carolina 
if any of our distribution centers were to shut down for any reason the other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the center 
we rely significantly on foreign sources of production 
we receive a substantial portion of our apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 

table of contents to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured  if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  or both  applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us  in addition  decreases in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period 
our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income  with a significant portion of operating income typically realized during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during this period  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding this period  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the back to school and holiday selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis  and have established a separate subsidiary whose primary purpose is to maintain and manage our current and future trademarks and service marks 
we are not aware of any claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks and service marks in the united states 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks  service marks and proprietary rights of others 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either are threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores may be negatively impacted 
a substantial portion of our 
table of contents merchandise is imported from other countries  see we rely significantly on foreign sources of production on page if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores  as well as fulfilling catalog and web site orders 
in the event of war or additional acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our expansion into enclosed shopping malls may not be successful 
our retail stores have often been located in unconventional retail spaces and in free standing buildings 
we have sought to expand the range of possible new store locations by opening urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores in enclosed shopping malls 
we cannot assure you that these mall stores will be accepted by our target customers or that they will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores 
the success of all of our mall stores will depend  in part  on the ability of the malls anchor tenants  such as large department stores  and other tenants and area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations 
sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area  the closing of anchor tenants or competition from non mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores

item properties our united states based home offices are located in philadelphia  pennsylvania and occupy approximately  square feet at walnut street  immediately adjacent to our anthropologie store at walnut street  and approximately  square feet at south th street 
our direct to consumer offices and order processing call center are located in edgefield county  south carolina as part of our  square foot distribution center  and occupy approximately  square feet 
we also operate additional direct to consumer offices at walnut street and sansom street in philadelphia  which occupy approximately  square feet 
our home office in europe is located at market place in london and occupies approximately  square feet of space 
our home offices and call center facilities are leased properties with varying lease term expirations through we own a  square foot distribution center in lancaster county  pennsylvania 
we also utilize a distribution facility in reno  nevada operated by a third party 
for more information on our distribution center properties  see item business company operations distribution 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
we plan to identify and utilize additional space over the next several years to accommodate our growth demands 
in april  we acquired several buildings in the historic core of the philadelphia navy yard 
this acquisition will allow for the efficient consolidation of our multiple philadelphia based offices on one campus and will support our growth needs for at least the next ten years 
the property is located at south broad street in philadelphia  approximately five miles from our existing philadelphia based home offices 
five of the buildings were purchased at a nominal price and two will be considered long term operating leases 
upon completion of certain improvements  the campus will provide office space of approximately  square feet 
options on several adjacent buildings are also available for at least the next ten years to allow for additional expansion if necessary 
anthropologie took occupancy of one of the buildings during the third quarter and we expect the 
table of contents balance of our philadelphia based support employees to take occupancy of the offices no later than the third quarter of fiscal we do not believe there will be a material financial impact to earnings associated with vacating our current headquarters 
the company spent approximately million on improvements at the navy yard during fiscal total expenditures on the project are expected to be between and million to improve the property  net of potential incentive credits  most of which will be capitalized and depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures 
the project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal all of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores are leased and are well maintained and in good operating condition 
our retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options for an additional five to ten years 
total estimated selling square feet for stores open  under lease at january   by urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people was approximately   and  respectively 
the average store selling square feet is approximately  for urban outfitters  approximately  for anthropologie and  for free people 
selling square feet can sometimes change due to floor moves  use of staircases  cash register configuration and other factors

item legal proceedings on march   an employee filed an employment related suit seeking class action status  unspecified monetary damages and equitable relief against anthropologie  inc  a subsidiary of the company  in the superior court of california for orange county 
the complaint alleges that  under california law  the plaintiff and certain other employees were misclassified as employees exempt from overtime and seeks recovery of unpaid wages  penalties and damages 
on october   the superior court granted the plaintiff s motion for class certification 
the company believes the claim is frivolous and without merit and intends to defend it vigorously 
the company is party to various other legal proceedings arising from normal business activities 
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the selected consolidated income statement and balance sheet data for each of the five fiscal years presented below is derived from the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the data presented below should be read in conjunction with item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto  which appear elsewhere in this report

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two business segments  a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business 
our retailing segment consists of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores and our direct to consumer operations  which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands 
a store is included in comparable store net sales data  as presented in this discussion  if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal  unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year 
sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable 
furthermore  non store sales  such as catalog and internet sales  are also considered non comparable 
although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores  we believe that  based only on our observations  changes in transaction volume  as discussed in our results of operations  correlate to changes in customer traffic 
we believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings  our web advertising  additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base  including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers 
our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
we plan to grow our store base by approximately per year 
retail stores as of january   we operated urban outfitters stores of which are located in the united states  three in canada and seven in europe 
during fiscal  we opened new urban outfitters stores  twelve of which are located within the united states  one store which we opened in canada and two of which we opened in the united kingdom 
urban outfitters targets young adults aged to through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment 
our product offering includes women s and men s fashion apparel  footwear and accessories  as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years  some of which may be outside the united states 
urban retail s north american and european store sales accounted for approximately and of consolidated net sales  respectively  for fiscal we operated anthropologie stores as of january   all of which are located in the united states 
during fiscal we opened new anthropologie stores 
anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged to our product assortment includes women s casual apparel and accessories  home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years 
anthropologie s store sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal 
table of contents we operated six free people stores as of january   all of which are located in the united states 
during fiscal we opened four new free people stores 
free people primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged to free people provides a unique merchandise mix of casual women s apparel  accessories and gifts 
we plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years 
free people s retail sales accounted for less than of consolidated net sales for fiscal for all brands combined  we plan to open approximately to stores during fiscal  including three to five new free people stores 
the remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between urban outfitters and anthropologie 
our goal thereafter is to increase net sales by at least per year through a combination of opening new stores  growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations 
direct to consumer in march  anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise  most of which is also available in our anthropologie stores 
during fiscal  we circulated over million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the anthropologie brand identity with our target customers 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million catalogs during fiscal and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
anthropologie operates an internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
anthropologie 
com  debuted in december the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel  accessories  household and gift merchandise 
as with our catalog  we believe that the web site increases anthropologie s reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of anthropologie s store operations 
in march  urban outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our urban outfitters stores 
in fiscal  we circulated approximately million urban outfitters catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million catalogs in fiscal urban outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
urbanoutfitters 
com  was launched in may the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store 
as with the urban outfitters catalog  we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of urban outfitters store operations 
we successfully launched the free people web site in september the web site  www 
freepeople 
com  offers consumers the entire free people product assortment found at free people retail stores as well as all of the free people wholesale offerings 
in october  free people introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our free people stores 
in fiscal  we circulated approximately million free people catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million catalogs in fiscal direct to consumer sales were approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal 
table of contents wholesale the free people wholesale division designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
our range of tops  bottoms  sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately  better department and specialty stores  including bloomingdale s  marshall fields  macy s west  nordstrom  urban outfitters and our own free people stores 
free people wholesale sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales  net of estimated customer returns 
payment for merchandise at our stores  and through our direct to consumer business  is by cash  check  credit card  debit card or gift card 
therefore  our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges 
deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
these custom orders  typically for upholstered furniture  have not been material 
gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption 
sales return reserve we record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported  but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit 
the reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends 
if the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate  additional sales returns would be recorded in the future 
as of january  and  reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled million and million  representing and of total liabilities  respectively 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost 
table of contents of merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories  such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and merchandise currently priced below original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  representing and of total assets  respectively 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
our reserves related to adjusting the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on recent historical trends 
our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis 
we expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly  related inventories 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements  as well as furniture and fixtures  and are included in the property and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life which is typically five years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of the urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for fiscal  and  write downs of long lived assets were immaterial 
we have only closed three store locations in our history  which in all cases took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms 
we have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement  whichever is less 

table of contents as of january   all of our stores opened in excess of three years are generating positive cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
we had valuation allowances of million as of january  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries 
in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the likelihood we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if appropriate 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 

table of contents results of operations as a percentage of net sales the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period 
this table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows fiscal year ended january  net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income other income other expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period change net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to  million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase was primarily attributable to a million  or increase  in retail segment sales 
free people wholesale sales contributed million or  excluding sales to our retail segment  to the increase 
the growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal was driven by a million increase in non comparable and new store net sales  a million or increase in comparable store sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of million or 
the increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a  and increase for anthropologie  free people and urban outfitters  respectively 
the increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal that were considered non comparable during fiscal comparable store net sales increases were primarily the result of an increase in the average sales prices resulting from higher initial margins which more than offset a heavy increase in markdowns during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal comparable store transactions improved modestly while units per transaction were down slightly 
thus far during fiscal  comparable store sales are below the same period in fiscal direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation 
table of contents of approximately million additional catalogs  increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at all brands 
the increase in free people wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings 
gross profit in fiscal increased to of net sales or million from of net sales or million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the leveraging of store related occupancy costs  driven by the increase in comparable store sales which more than offset the increase in markdowns 
total inventories at january  increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores 
on a comparable store basis  inventories increased by versus the prior fiscal year

fiscal compared to fiscal operating leases in a february letter to the american institute of certified public accountants  the sec clarified its position regarding certain lease accounting practices 
the sec s letter specifically addressed the depreciable life of leasehold improvements  rent holidays and landlord tenant incentives 
based upon the sec s conclusions included in their letter  we reviewed our historical treatment of these lease issues to ensure our accounting treatment reflected the sec s conclusions 
historically  we had recorded rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period commencing on the date the store opened 
the lease period did not include the construction period to make the lease space suitable for operations during which time we were not permitted to occupy the space for retail purposes 
we changed our straight line period to include this construction period in our calculation of rent expense over the lease term  which results in an accounting lease term that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
therefore  for purposes of calculating straight line rent expense  the commencement date of the lease term reflects the date we take possession of the building for initial construction and setup 

table of contents we had also historically classified tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of property and equipment 
the related amortization was classified as a reduction of depreciation expense on our consolidated statements of income 
our consolidated statements of cash flows historically reflected tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities 
we changed the classification of tenant improvement allowances on our consolidated financial statements to reflect such items as deferred rent that will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the straight line period 
furthermore  tenant improvement allowance activity is now presented as part of cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows after assessing our findings using the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recorded a cumulative adjustment of million  net of tax  which reduced net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase was primarily attributable to a million  or increase  in retail segment sales 
free people wholesale sales contributed million or  excluding sales to our retail segment  to the increase 
the growth in our retail segment sales during fiscal was driven by a million increase in non comparable and new store net sales  a million or increase in comparable store net sales and an increase in direct to consumer sales of million or 
the increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a  and increase for anthropologie  free people and urban outfitters  respectively 
the increase in net sales attributable to non comparable and new stores was primarily the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal that were considered non comparable during fiscal comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial price points which more than offset a modest increase in markdowns 
direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the circulation of approximately million additional catalogs  increased traffic to the web sites and improvements in the average order value at both urban outfitters and anthropologie 
the increase in free people wholesale sales was driven by an increase in customer response to our fashion offerings 
gross profit in fiscal increased to of net sales or million from million or of net sales in fiscal improvements to initial margins due to better merchandise sourcing and the leveraging of store related occupancy costs  driven by the comparable store sales increases  accounted for the majority of this increase 
this combined increase more than offset the million  or of net sales  multi year cumulative charge to accelerate deferred rent for store locations resulting from our review of our historical method of accounting for certain operating leases 
total inventories at january  increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily related to the acquisition of inventory to stock new retail stores 
on a comparable store basis  inventories increased by versus the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal decreased to of net sales versus of net sales for fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses

our working capital was million  million and million for these years  respectively 
the change in working capital is primarily due to the increase in our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories that have increased in order to support our current growth 
during the last three years  we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations 
our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories

cash paid for property and equipment  net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal  and were million  million and million respectively  and were primarily used to expand and support our store base 
during fiscal  we plan to construct and open to new stores  renovate certain existing stores  increase our catalog circulation by million  to million catalogs  and purchase inventory for our stores and direct to consumer business at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth 
we plan to increase the level of capital expenditures during fiscal to approximately million  primarily to expand our store base and continue construction of our new home office campus 
we believe that our new store  catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year 
improvements to our home office and distribution facilities are necessary to adequately support our growth 
the company spent approximately million on improvements at the navy yard during fiscal total expenditures on the project are expected to be between and million to improve the property  net of potential incentive credits  most of which will be capitalized and depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures 
the project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal we anticipate opening a distribution center in fiscal on the west coast of the united states to support our western stores 
the facility will be financed through an operating lease  however  we expect to spend to million on equipment and other improvements

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas no 
r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date or later modification 
in addition  sfas no 
r will require stock based compensation resulting from the continued vesting of grants issued prior to adoption of sfas r to be reflected in our consolidated statements of income over the remaining requisite service period 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on february   using the modified prospective approach mpa 
the mpa requires that compensation expense be recorded for restricted stock and all unvested stock options beginning as of february  we expect to continue using the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees 
for pro forma footnote disclosure purposes  we recognized the majority of our share based compensation costs using the accelerated recognition method as permitted by sfas no 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will continue to recognize the cost of previously granted share based awards under the accelerated recognition method 
sfas no 
r will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes 
these amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of income taxes paid in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we are continuing to evaluate the requirements of sfas no 
r and sab as of february   unvested stock based compensation expense  not including our restricted stock grant  is approximately million and we currently expect that the adoption of sfas no

in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this 
table of contents interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
we adopted fin in the fourth quarter of fiscal and this adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations

sfas no
