item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
service as the life and usage of our installed base of light sources in production at chipmakers exceed the original warranty periods  some chipmakers request service contracts from us 
additionally  we provide billable service or service contracts to the three semiconductor lithography tool manufacturers and to many of our chipmaker customers 
these service agreements require us to maintain and or service these light sources either on an on call or regular interval basis or both 
some of these contracts include replacement of consumable parts and non consumable parts 
in addition to service contracts  we offer cymeronline tm  a diagnostic and performance software product which delivers critical laser diagnostics and performance information in near real time directly to authorized users anywhere 
the software simplifies reporting and allows users to efficiently manage consumables usage 
cymeronline features a user friendly browser based interface  which features a robust design and provides a secure data environment 
event initiated messages sent to pagers  e mail  mobile phones  or other handheld devices enable up to the minute communication and proactive management 
revenues generated from service and service contracts were approximately million  million and million for  and respectively 
we expect service and service contract revenues to remain at or exceed these higher levels as our installed base grows and the warranty period of our light source systems expires 
customers and end users we sell our photolithography light source products to each of the three manufacturers of duv photolithography tools asm lithography canon nikon we believe that maintaining and strengthening customer relationships will play an important role in maintaining our leading position in the photolithography market 
we work closely with our customers to integrate our products into their photolithography tools 
sales to asm lithography  canon  and nikon accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue in revenues generated from customers within the us were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers outside of the us were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers located in japan were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
revenues generated from customers located in europe were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these revenues can originate from any of our locations to customers located in these countries 
long lived assets located in the us were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
long lived assets located outside of the us were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
end users of our light sources include all of the world s largest semiconductor manufacturers

backlog we schedule production of light sources based upon order backlog and informal customer forecasts 
we include in backlog only those orders to which a purchase order number has been assigned by the customer and for which delivery has been specified within months 
because customers may cancel or delay orders with little or no penalty  our backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared with a backlog of million at december  manufacturing our manufacturing activities consist of material management  assembly  integration and testing 
these activities are performed in a  square foot facility in san diego  california that includes approximately  square feet of class  cleanroom manufacturing and test space 
in order to focus our own resources  capitalize on the expertise of our key suppliers and respond more efficiently to customer demand  we have outsourced the manufacture of many of our subassemblies 
our manufacturing outsourcing strategy is exemplified by the modular design of our products 
substantially all manufacturing of nonproprietary subassemblies has been contracted to third party suppliers 
as a result  we are increasingly dependent upon these contract suppliers to meet our manufacturing schedules 
the failure by one or more of these suppliers to supply us on a timely basis with sufficient quantities of components or subassemblies that perform to our specifications could affect our ability to deliver completed light sources to our customers on schedule 
we believe that the highly outsourced content and manufacturable design of our products allows for reduced manufacturing cycle times and increased output per employee 
to improve current production efficiencies  control costs  and manage overall manufacturing capacity  we intend to continue to provide additional training to manufacturing personnel  improve our assembly and test processes in order to reduce cycle time  invest in additional manufacturing tooling and further develop our supplier management and engineering capabilities 
in addition to the manufacturing capacity at our facilities in san diego  california  we completed the construction of a refurbishment facility in korea in late this facility refurbishes discharge chambers for light sources in korea and the asia pacific region 
the refurbishment facility in korea includes  square feet of class  cleanroom manufacturing space 
we shipped the first chamber to a customer from this facility in january a limited number of components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a small group of suppliers 
for certain optical  control system and pulse power components and subassemblies used in our light source systems  we currently utilize a single supplier 
where possible  we work with secondary suppliers to qualify additional sources of supply 
to reduce the risk associated with this single supplier  we carry significant strategic inventories of these components 
strategic inventories are managed as a percentage of future demand 
we have also negotiated to have vendor managed inventory of critical components to further reduce the risk of a single supplier 
to date we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of the components and subassemblies used in the production of our light source systems in a timely manner from existing sources 
if in the future we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of required materials  components or subassemblies  or if such items do not meet our quality standards  delays or reductions in product shipments could occur which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts are designed to serve our customer base consisting of both the duv photolithography tool providers such as asm lithography  canon and nikon as well as many of the world s top chipmakers 
we market and sell our products through our own worldwide direct sales and marketing channels and we have developed product and applications engineering teams to support these efforts 
we believe that in order for our sales and marketing organization to be successful  we must work closely with and understand the requirements of both the photolithography systems solutions providers and the end user semiconductor manufacturers 
service and support we believe our success in the semiconductor photolithography market is highly dependent upon after sales support to both our direct and our end user customers 
we support our customers with field service  technical service engineers and training programs  and in some cases provide ongoing on site technical support at the customer s manufacturing facility 
prior to shipment  our support personnel typically assist the customer in site preparation and inspection and provide customers with training at our facilities or at the customer s location 
we also provide direct customers and end users with a comprehensive set of manuals  including operations  maintenance  service  diagnostic and safety manuals 
our field engineers and technical support specialists provide field service and front line technical support capability from our san diego headquarters  and at our field service offices located throughout the us support in europe  japan  korea  singapore  the people s republic of china  taiwan and southeast asia is provided by our subsidiaries located within those regions 
as part of our customer service  we maintain an inventory of spare parts at each of our service facilities 
as our installed base grows  replacement parts required to satisfy worldwide support requirements  as well as our own logistics support organization  will be subject to the fluctuating demands of the semiconductor industry 
in order to meet these demands  we must continue to effectively manage our production of component modules which are required for new systems  as well as for support and warranty requirements for installed systems 
we believe that the need to provide fast and responsive service to the level of quality required by semiconductor manufacturers using our light sources is critical and that we cannot depend solely on our customers to provide this service 
therefore  we believe it is essential to maintain  through our own personnel  a rapid response capability to service our customers and end users throughout the world 
accordingly  we seek to continuously develop and enhance our direct support infrastructure in europe  japan  korea  singapore  the people s republic of china  taiwan and southeast asia and the us this task entails recruiting and training qualified field service personnel or identifying qualified independent firms and maintaining effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to customers in various countries in their assigned regions 
we generally warrant our new light source products against defects in design  materials  and workmanship 
the warranty period and terms vary by light source model 
we also warrant consumable and spare parts sold to our customers and the coverage period varies by spare part type as some types include time based warranty periods and others include usage based warranty periods 
research and development the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
we believe that continued and timely development and introduction of new and enhanced light source products are essential for us to maintain our competitive position 
we intend to continue to develop our technology and innovative products to meet customer demands 
current projects include enhancements to our krf and arf light sources and the new mopa platform 
we have expended development efforts to address the technology and products that will be based on the extreme ultraviolet euv technology needed for future generation photolithography illumination sources 
while we are no longer making direct investments in fluorine f light source development  we expect the combination of our previous investment  together with continued platform and core technology developments in our other products to enable us to acquire a leadership position should a market for f light sources develop 
we may also invest in other product and technology areas in order to expand our portfolio within the semiconductor capital equipment market sector 
in addition there are ongoing efforts to improve existing products  reduce manufacturing costs  lower the cost of light source operation  enhance light source performance  develop new features for existing light sources  and conduct research and development of non light source products 
we have historically devoted a significant portion of our financial resources to research and development programs and we expect to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts 
research and development expenses for  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in the last three years  we have entered into several research and development agreements related to euv technology both with customers and government agencies 
the largest of these research and development agreements was with intel corporation in january this agreement provides funding to accelerate the development of production worthy euv lithography light sources at their request 
the funding being received from intel under this agreement is milestone based and is netted against our total research and development expenses in the period the milestone is achieved 
the total funding recorded under this agreement for and was million and million  respectively 
revenues generated from research and development contracts amounted to approximately   and million during  and  respectively 
for certain of our research and development contracts  our research and development expenses are offset by amounts earned associated with these contracts 
the amounts offset against research and development expenses were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in july  we entered into a joint venture agreement with zeiss and tcz gmbh tcz  a swiss limited liability company that is headquartered in san diego and is owned by us and by zeiss 
tcz is currently developing  and will integrate  market  sell  and support  process tools for the flat panel display manufacturing industry 
the joint venture is targeting the growing market for low temperature poly silicon ltps processing used in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays that are brighter  have higher resolution  and consume less power than displays using today s predominant amorphous silicon films 
tcz currently expects to ship an evaluation model of the tcz x by late or early as a majority owned subsidiary  tcz s research and development expenses are included in our consolidated research and development expenses 
intellectual property rights while the success of our business depends more on such factors as the technical expertise of our employees  as well as their innovative skills and marketing and customer relations abilities  the success of our business also relies on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
accordingly  we seek to protect our intellectual property rights in a variety of ways  including by obtaining patents 
as of december   we owned us patents covering certain aspects of technology related to light sources and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to october as of december   we had applied for additional patents in the us as of december   we owned foreign patents and had patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
due to cost constraints  we did not begin seeking patent protection in japan and other countries for our inventions that are covered by our us patents and patent applications until as a result  we do not have the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us thus  the likelihood of piracy of our technology and products is greater in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in appropriate proceedings in the courts or the patent offices to determine the priority of inventions 
these proceedings may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
loss of priority in these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on trade secret protection  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
in the past  funds from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these funds from government sponsored programs and customers  in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
currently  funds from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers are used to fund a small portion of our research and development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market this intellectual property may arise between the funding organizations and us 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu has notified us that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our subsequent discussions with komatsu  they also asserted that our former japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  or we may be infringing on some of komatsu s us patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our light sources infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continued to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our former manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agree to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitor and others of our us patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that it may be infringing some of our us patents 
we have discussed with komatsu our claims against each other 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the united states patent and trademark office uspto but our patent was subsequently re issued by the uspto 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography light source business to our competitor  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with lambda physik a subsidiary of coherent  inc regarding allegations by each party against the other of possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitor or former competitor may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may result due to a claim of infringement by our competitor or any other third party or may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our effort  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
instead of litigation  or as a result thereof  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license 
alternatively  we may design around the third party s intellectual property rights 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have granted seiko a right of first refusal to fund our development of  and receive a license to  new industrial light source technologies not developed with funding from other parties 
in exchange for these rights  we received up front license fees of million in aggregate during and we were also entitled to royalties of on related product sales through september  after which the royalty rate was subject to renegotiation 
to date no renegotiation of the royalty rate has occurred 
through  we earned no royalties under the agreement 
the license agreement also provides that product sales between us and seiko will be at a discount from the respective companies list prices 
the agreement terminates in august there has been no production or sales activity by seiko associated with this contract to date and this contract does not apply to our current light source system products 
we have registered the trademarks cymer and insist on cymer and others in the us and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the us and in other countries 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis and this would be costly to defend 
if a trademark infringement action were successful  we would have to stop using the mark and possibly pay damages 
competition we believe that the principal elements of competition in our markets are the technical performance characteristics of the excimer light source products and the operating efficiency of the system  which is based on availability  performance efficiency and rate of quality 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors 
we currently have one significant competitor  gigaphoton  that sells light sources for duv photolithography applications 
headquartered in japan  gigaphoton is a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio 
we believe that gigaphoton is aggressively trying to gain larger penetration in the duv light source market 
we know that our direct customers have purchased products from gigaphoton and have approved its light sources for use with their products 
we also know that gigaphoton has been approved by chipmakers in japan  the us and elsewhere for producing excimer light sources 
we could lose market share and our growth could slow or even decline if gigaphoton gains additional market acceptance 
in the future  we will likely experience competition from other technologies  such as euv and electron projection lithography 
to remain competitive  we believe that we will need to manufacture and deliver products to customers on a timely basis without significant defects and maintain a high level of investment in research and development and sales and marketing 
we might not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments necessary to maintain our competitive position 
larger competitors with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of light sources and may attempt to supply consumables and spare parts to that installed base 
employees on december   we employed persons worldwide 
no employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of any labor organization as far as we are aware 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not currently think are material may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter have varied in the past and our future operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly 
factors that contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results include demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  rates at which chipmakers take delivery of photolithography tools from lithography tool manufacturers our customers  rates at which our customers take delivery of light source systems from us  timing and size of orders from our small base of customers  product lead time demands from our customers and the chipmakers  mix of light source models  consumable and spare parts and service revenues in our total revenues  changes in the price and profitability of our products  our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products  changes in market penetration by our competitor  utilization rates of light sources and sales of consumable and spare parts and services  our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements  our ability to manage customer satisfaction  product reliability  and direct field service and support effectiveness  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by our japanese subsidiary are denominated  worldwide political instability  changing global economic conditions  including rising energy prices  and intellectual property protection 
we have historically derived a large portion of our quarterly and annual revenues from selling a small number of light source systems 
because we sell a small number of products  the precise time that we recognize revenue from an order may have a significant impact on our total revenue for a particular period 
our customers may cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalty 
orders expected in one quarter could shift to another period due to changes in the anticipated timing of customers purchase decisions or rescheduled delivery dates requested by our customers 
our operating results for a particular quarter or year may be adversely affected if our customers  particularly our three largest customers  cancel or reschedule orders  or if we cannot fill orders in time due to unexpected delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping  and product acceptance 
we manage our expense levels based  in large part  on expected future revenues 
as a result  our expenses are relatively fixed for the short term  and if our actual revenue decreases below the level we expect  our operating results will be adversely affected 
as a result of these or other factors  we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue  gross profit and operating income 
our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock  particularly on a short term basis  and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock 
our business depends on the semiconductor and the semiconductor capital equipment industries  which are highly volatile and unpredictable 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers  or original equipment manufacturer oem customers  who incorporate our light source systems in photolithography tools that they sell to semiconductor manufacturers  or chipmakers  and from chipmakers who purchase consumables  spare parts  upgrades and service directly from us 
like us  our oem customers depend on demand for their products from the chipmakers 
the capital equipment and related operating expenditures of chipmakers depend on a number of factors  including the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the many products using semiconductors 
that demand is highly volatile and unpredictable 
as a result of the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  the semiconductor capital equipment industry historically has experienced periodic ups and downs and currently appears to be in flux  with industry experts uncertain about the level of growth to expect in in late and early  business indicators for our industry have become more positive  and estimates of semiconductor capital equipment spending for the full year of now range from an increase of at least to as much as to over levels 
the lithography segment of the semiconductor capital equipment industry could grow at about double the rate of the industry as a whole due to a perceived need for additional lithography tools  with advanced lithography tools expected to have higher average selling prices 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and the semiconductor capital equipment industries affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and therefore our ability to manage our future expense levels 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle or slowdown  we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions while still being able to motivate and retain our key employees 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles 
we are not able to predict with any certainty the duration of any industry cycle or the timing or order of magnitude of any recovery 
downturns in the semiconductor industry often result in decreases in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including the photolithography tools that our oem customers produce 
the previous downturn in the semiconductor industry had a severe effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
fluctuating levels of investment by chipmakers and resulting pricing volatility will continue to materially affect our aggregate bookings  revenues and operating results 
even during periods of reduced revenues we believe we must continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive 
continued spending in furtherance of these objectives may temporarily harm our financial results 
semiconductor industry downturns and slowdowns are likely to continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results  and our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors in future quarters 
any failure to meet such expectations could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our oem customers try to manage their inventories and production requirements to appropriate levels that reflect their expected sales to chipmakers 
market conditions in the semiconductor industry and our oem customers production efficiency can cause them to expand or reduce their orders for new light source systems as they try to manage their inventories and production requirements 
we continue to work with our oem customers to better understand these issues 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in understanding our oem customers inventory management and production requirements or that our oem customers will not build up an excess inventory of light source systems 
if our oem customers retain an excess inventory of light source systems  our revenue could be reduced in future periods as the excess inventory is utilized  which could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
if our oem customers demand shorter product lead times to improve their inventory and cash positions  our inventory management and cash position may be negatively impacted  which may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from sales to a few large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  or delay or default on payments  our revenues would be reduced and our financial condition and cash flows would suffer 
three large companies  asm lithography  canon and nikon dominate the photolithography tool business 
collectively  these three companies accounted for the following percentage of our total revenue during the periods indicated years ended december  asm lithography canon nikon total collectively  these three companies accounted for the following percentage of our total accounts receivable at the dates indicated december  december  asm lithography canon nikon total we expect that sales of our light source products to these three customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase a minimum number of our products in the aggregate or during any particular period 
we can provide no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products at past or current levels 
for example  revenue attributable to sales to canon has declined by more than over the last two fiscal years 
sales to canon or any of these customers may be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include a change in a customer s competitive position in its industry  a customer experiencing lithography tool production problems  a decision to purchase light sources from other suppliers  changes in economic conditions in the semiconductor or the photolithography tool industries  and a decline in a customer s financial condition 
the loss of any significant business from or production problems for any one of these three customers would harm our business and financial condition 
a substantial percentage of our revenue is derived from the sale of a limited number of primary products 
our only current product line is excimer light source systems  including krf and arf systems  and support  including consumable and spare parts and service support 
we expect these light source systems and the related support to continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our light source system products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
the primary market for excimer light sources is in the use of duv photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices using smaller circuit geometries 
the demand for our products depends in part on the rate at which chipmakers further adopt excimer light sources as the chosen light source for their photolithography tools 
the rate with which chipmakers adopt excimer light sources may vary for a variety of reasons  including inadequate performance of photoresists used in advanced duv photolithography  potential shortages of specialized materials used in duv optics  productivity of mm photolithography tools relative to mm tools  and consolidation of chipmakers 
we cannot guarantee that these factors can or will be overcome or that the demand for our excimer light source products will not be materially reduced 
the demand for our light source products  and therefore our operating results  financial condition and cash flows  could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a decline in demand for our customers duv photolithography tools  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products  a failure to manage customer satisfaction  product reliability  and direct field service and support effectiveness  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we depend on the introduction of new products for our success  and we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change 
rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop  manufacture  timely introduce and support new light source products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing light source systems and process capabilities 
due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products  we must forecast accurate demand for new products while managing the transition from older products 
our most significant product introduction in recent years consisted of a technology change from a single discharge chamber excimer light source to a dual discharge chamber design called mopa 
the mopa design represents a paradigm shift from previously accepted lithography technology and offers chipmakers higher power  tighter bandwidth and lower cost of operation for their current and we expect for their future optical lithography applications 
as originally designed  the mopa architecture was projected to provide its benefits across all three duv wavelengths nm  nm  and nm but at this time  the semiconductor industry has only adopted mopa at the nm wavelength  due to the successful extension of nm single chamber technology  and the omission of nm lithography from the roadmap 
there are risks inherent in the ongoing transition to the mopa technology  including effective execution of our product development roadmap  continuing adoption of the product by lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers  manufacturability  cost effectiveness  and product performance in the field of the new products and the development of a comparable product by our competitor 
we believe that chipmakers are currently developing a capability to produce devices that are measured at nm or less  and these efforts are driving the current demand for our light source products for duv photolithography systems 
after chipmakers have this capability  their demand for our light source products will depend  in part  on whether they want to expand their capacity to manufacture these devices 
this will in turn depend on whether their sales forecasts and projected manufacturing process yields justify the necessary investments 
future technologies such as euv  electron projection lithography  and maskless lithography may render our excimer light source products obsolete 
we must manage product transitions  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
if new products are not introduced on time  or have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a timely or cost effective manner that satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
failure to develop and introduce these new products and enhancements could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect to face significant competition from current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this market  which may affect our ability to sell our new products 
furthermore  new products represent significant investments of our resources and their success  or lack thereof  could have a material effect on our financial results 
failure to maintain effectively our direct field service and support organization could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe it is critical for us to provide quick and responsive service directly to the chipmakers throughout the world that use our light source products in their photolithography systems  and that it is essential to maintain our own personnel or trained third party resources to provide these services 
accordingly  we have an ongoing effort to develop our direct support system with locations in europe  korea  japan  the people s republic of china  singapore  taiwan and the us this requires us to do the following recruit and train qualified field service personnel  identify qualified independent firms  and maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to our customers in various countries 
we may not be able to attract and train qualified personnel to maintain our direct support operations successfully 
we may not be able to find and engage qualified third party resources to supplement and enhance our direct support operations 
further  we may incur significant costs in providing these support services 
failure to implement our direct support operation effectively could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we must develop and manufacture enhancements to our existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to grow our business 
we may not effectively manage our growth and integrate these new enhancements and products  which could materially harm our business 
to continue to grow our business  our existing light source products and their process capabilities must be enhanced  and we must develop and manufacture new products to serve other semiconductor applications 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our business to grow effectively 
nor can we guarantee that we will be able to accelerate the development of new enhancements to our existing products and create new products 
further  we may not be able to effectively integrate new products and applications into our current operations 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must effectively manage changes in our business 
in order to respond to the business cycles of the semiconductor industry  in the past few years we have sharply expanded and contracted the scope of our operations and the number of employees in many of our locations and departments 
as the semiconductor industry cycle moves between growth and contraction we will need to closely manage our global operations  improve our process and other internal management systems  improve our quality control  order fulfillment  field service and customer support capabilities  quickly adapt to changing sales and marketing channels  effectively manage our inventory levels  and attract  train  retain and manage key personnel 
if we fail to effectively manage changes in our business  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected 
chipmakers prolonged use of our products in high volume production may not produce the results they desire and  as a result  our reputation and that of our customers who supply photolithography tools to the chipmakers could be damaged in the semiconductor industry 
over time  our light source products may not meet chipmakers production specifications or operating cost requirements after the light source has been used for a long period in high volume production 
if any chipmaker cannot successfully achieve or sustain their volume production using our light sources  our reputation could be damaged with the chipmakers and our customers who are the limited number of lithography tool manufacturers 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on a few key suppliers for purchasing components and subassemblies that are included in our products 
we purchase a limited number of components and subassemblies included in our light source products from a single supplier or a small group of suppliers 
for certain optical  control system and pulse power components and subassemblies used in our light source systems  we currently utilize a single supplier 
to reduce the risk associated with this single supplier  we carry a significant strategic inventory of these components 
strategic inventories are managed as a percentage of future demand 
we have also negotiated to have vendor managed inventory of critical components to further reduce the risk of a single supplier 
in addition  we contract the manufacture of various subassemblies more often than in the past 
further  some of our suppliers have specialized in supplying equipment or manufacturing services to semiconductor equipment manufacturers and therefore are susceptible to industry ups and downs and subject to the same risks and uncertainties regarding their ability to respond to changing market conditions 
because many of these suppliers reduce the size of their workforce in an industry downturn and increase it in an upturn  they may not be able to meet our requirements or respond quickly enough as an upturn begins and gains momentum 
due to the nature of our product development requirements  these key suppliers must rapidly advance their own technologies and production capabilities in order to support the introduction schedule of our new products 
these suppliers may not be able to provide new modules and subassemblies when they are needed to satisfy our product schedule requirements 
if we cannot purchase enough of these materials  components or subassemblies  or if these items do not meet our quality standards  there could be delays or reductions in our product shipments  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we face competition from one company and may face competition from additional competitors who enter the market 
we are currently aware of one significant competitor that sells light sources for duv photolithography applications 
this competitor  gigaphoton  is a joint venture between two large companies  komatsu and ushio  and is headquartered in japan 
additionally  late in  a former competitor coherent  inc  a us company  announced that their lambda physik subsidiary would no longer pursue the excimer light source systems business for photolithography in the semiconductor industry 
we believe that gigaphoton is aggressively trying to gain larger market penetration in the excimer light source industry 
we know that our customers have purchased products from this competitor and that our customers have approved this competitor s light sources for use with their products 
we know that gigaphoton has been approved by chipmakers in japan  the us and elsewhere for producing excimer light sources 
larger companies with substantially greater resources  such as other manufacturers of industrial light sources for advanced lithography  may attempt to sell competitive products to our customers 
potential competitors may also be attracted to our growing installed base of light sources which represents a steady and significant consumable and spare parts revenue stream for us  and they may attempt to supply consumable and spare parts to that installed base 
if any existing or future competitors gain market acceptance we could lose market share and our growth could slow or decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we depend on key personnel  especially management and technical personnel  who may be difficult to attract and retain 
we are highly dependent on the services of many key employees in various areas  including research and development  engineering  sales and marketing  field service and support  manufacturing  and management 
in particular  there are a limited number of experts in excimer light source technology  and we require highly skilled hardware and software engineers 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees 
we believe that our future growth and operating results will depend on the continued services of our research and development  engineering  sales and marketing  field service and support  manufacturing and management personnel  our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled key personnel  and the ability of our personnel and key employees to continue to expand  train and manage our employee base 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain key personnel as required  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
economic  political  regulatory and other events in geographic areas where we have significant sales or operations could interfere with our business 
we serve an increasingly global market 
a large portion of our total revenues is derived from customers located outside of the us  particularly in asian countries 
we expect our international sales to continue to account for a very large portion of our total revenues 
in order to support our foreign customers  we maintain a manufacturing and field service subsidiary in korea as well as field service and support subsidiaries in japan  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  singapore and taiwan 
we may not be able to manage our operations to address and support our global customers effectively 
further  our investments in these types of activities may not make us competitive in the global market or we may not be able to meet the service  support  and manufacturing levels required by our global customers 
additionally  we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business globally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates and currency controls  political and economic conditions and instability  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions  including changes in tariff and freight rates  foreign customs and duties  difficulty in coordinating our management and operations in several different countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  limited intellectual property protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences in some countries  the possibility of accounts receivable collection difficulties  in the case of asia  the risk of business interruption and damage from earthquakes  the effect of acts of terrorism and war  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
many of our major customers and many of the chipmakers who use our light source products in their photolithography systems are located in asia 
economic problems and currency fluctuations affecting these regions in asia could create a larger risk for us 
further  even though it has not been difficult for us to comply with us export controls  these export rules could change in the future and make it more difficult or impossible for us to export our products to many countries 
any of these vulnerabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may acquire a business or enter a new market that will involve numerous risks 
we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational and financial challenges 
the risks involved with acquiring a new company  forming a joint venture  or entering a new market include the following diversion of management s attention and resources to integrate the new company or new business opportunity  failure to retain key personnel  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company or new product in a new market  amortization of acquired definite lived intangible assets and deferred compensation  the cost associated with acquisitions and joint ventures and the integration of acquired operations  the cost associated with developing  marketing  introducing and supporting a new product in a new market  failure to commercialize purchased technologies  ability of the acquired companies  joint ventures or new markets to meet their financial projections  assumption of unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  nasdaq stock market rules and new accounting pronouncements as they relate to the new company or joint venture 
mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures as well as entering new markets are inherently subject to multiple significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in july  we formed a joint venture with zeiss named tcz gmbh  to produce tools for the manufacture of flat panel displays 
this is a new market for both cymer and zeiss and may involve numerous risks 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
further  any business that we acquire  joint venture that we form or new market we may enter may not achieve anticipated revenues or operating results 
compliance with changing regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations  nasdaq stock market rules  and new accounting pronouncements are creating uncertainty and additional complexities for companies such as ours 
in particular  the section internal control requirements under the sarbanes oxley act have added and will continue to add complexity and costs to our business and require a significant investment of our time and resources to complete each year 
we take these requirements seriously and expect to continue to make every effort to ensure that we receive clean attestations on our internal controls each year from our outside auditors 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all other evolving standards 
these investments may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from strategic revenue generating and cost management activities 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used broad based stock option programs and other forms of equity related incentives as a key component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options and other long term equity incentives directly motivate a broader base of employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of long term vesting  encourage employees to remain with us 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment to statement nos 
and  which we have adopted as of january  this new rule requires us to record an expense to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
moreover  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans has made it more difficult and expensive for us to grant options to employees  which has resulted in changes to our equity compensation strategy  including a reduction in the number of stock options granted to employees 
we have already developed alternative cash compensation arrangements for our employees to replace the majority of these stock option programs and may be required to offer additional alternative cash compensation arrangements in the future 
these and other developments in the provision of equity compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and such a change in accounting rules and alternative cash compensation programs may adversely impact our future operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
these types of claims could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
we believe our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
as of december   we owned us patents covering certain aspects of technology related to light sources and piezo techniques 
these patents will expire at various times during the period from january to october as of december   we had applied for additional patents in the us as of december   we owned foreign patents and had patent applications pending in various foreign countries 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with a competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
in addition  third parties patents might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
as a result of cost constraints  we did not begin seeking patent protection in japan and other countries for our inventions that are covered by us patents and patent applications until as a result we do not have the right to seek foreign patent protection for some of our early inventions 
additionally  laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us thus  the likelihood of piracy of our technology and products is greater in these countries 
further  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around patents that are granted to us 
other companies or persons may have filed or may file in the future patent applications that are similar or identical to ours 
we may have to participate in appropriate proceedings in the courts or the patent offices to determine the priority of inventions 
these proceedings may determine that these third party patent applications have priority over our patent applications 
loss of priority in these interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
we also rely on the following to protect our confidential information and our other intellectual property trade secret protection  employee nondisclosure agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods 
however  we may not be successful in protecting our confidential information and intellectual property  particularly our trade secrets  because third parties may independently develop substantially the same proprietary information and techniques  gain access to our trade secrets  or disclose our technology 
the parties to whom we provide research and development services may dispute the ownership of the intellectual property that we develop performing these services 
in the past  funds from research and development arrangements with third parties have been used to pay for a portion of our own research and development expenses 
we receive these funds from government sponsored programs and customers  in connection with our designing and developing specific products 
currently  funds from lithography tool manufacturers and chipmakers are used to fund a small portion of our research and development expenses 
in providing these research and development services to these manufacturers  we try to make clear who owns the intellectual property that results from the research and development services we perform 
however  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market this intellectual property may arise between the funding organizations and us 
any dispute over ownership of the intellectual property we develop could restrict our ability to market our products and have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the future  we may be subject to patent litigation to enforce patents issued to us and defend ourselves against claimed infringement by our competitor or any other third party 
third parties have notified us in the past  and may notify us in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
also  we have notified third parties in the past  and may notify them in the future  that they may be infringing our intellectual property rights 
specifically  komatsu has notified us that we may be infringing some of its japanese patents 
during our subsequent discussions  komatsu also asserted that our former japanese manufacturing partner  seiko  or we may be infringing on some of komatsu s us patents and a number of its additional japanese patents 
komatsu has also notified one of our customers  nikon  of its belief that our light sources infringe several of komatsu s japanese and us patents 
as a result  we started proceedings in the japanese patent office to oppose certain patents and patent applications of komatsu 
the japanese patent office has dismissed our opposition claims 
thus  litigation may result in connection with komatsu s japanese patents or us patents 
also  komatsu might claim that we infringe other or additional patents 
komatsu notified seiko that it intends to enforce its rights against seiko with respect to its japanese patents if seiko continued to engage in manufacturing activities for us 
in connection with our former manufacturing agreement with seiko  we agree to pay seiko under certain conditions for damages associated with these types of claims 
seiko may not prevail in any litigation against komatsu  and therefore  we may be required to pay seiko for such damages 
we have notified our competitor and others of our us patent portfolio 
specifically  we have notified komatsu that it may be infringing some of our us patents 
we have discussed with komatsu our claims against each other 
komatsu challenged one of our us patents in the uspto but our patent was subsequently re issued by the uspto 
also  komatsu transferred its lithography light source business to our competitor  gigaphoton 
we also have had discussions with lambda physik a subsidiary of coherent  inc regarding allegations by each party against the other for possible patent infringement 
any of these discussions with our competitor or former competitor may not be successful and litigation could result 
in the future  patent litigation may result due to a claim of infringement by our competitor or any other third party or may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our effort  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our customers and the end users of our products might assert other claims for indemnification that arise from infringement claims against them 
if these assertions are successful  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially affected 
instead of litigation  or as a result thereof  we may seek a license from third parties to use their intellectual property 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license 
alternatively  we may design around the third party s intellectual property rights or we may challenge these claims in legal proceedings 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding could result in one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results loss of our proprietary rights  exposure to significant liabilities by other third parties  requirement that we get a license from third parties on terms that are not favorable  or restriction from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademark infringement claims against our registered and unregistered trademarks would be expensive and we may have to stop using such trademarks and pay damages 
we registered the trademarks cymer and insist on cymer and others in the us and in some other countries 
we are also trying to register additional trademarks in the us and in other countries 
we use these trademarks and many other marks in our advertisements and other business materials  which are distributed throughout the world 
we may be subject to trademark infringement actions for using these marks and other marks on a worldwide basis and this would be costly to defend 
if a trademark infringement action were successful  we would have to stop using the mark and possibly pay damages 
we are dependent on air transport to conduct our business and disruption of domestic and international air transport systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on regular and reliable air transportation on a worldwide basis for many of our routine business functions 
if civil aviation in the us or abroad is disrupted by terrorist activities or security responses to the threat of terrorism or for any other reason  our business could be adversely affected in the following ways supplies of raw materials and components for the manufacture of our products or our customers products may be disrupted  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner  we may not be able to provide timely service or support of installed light sources for chipmakers  and our sales and marketing efforts may be disrupted 
we are exposed to risks related to the fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for all foreign currencies in which we do business  but particularly for the japanese yen 
when we sell products to our japanese subsidiary  the sale is denominated in us dollars 
when our japanese subsidiary sells our products directly to customers in japan  the sale is denominated in japanese yen 
thus  our results of operations may fluctuate based on the changing value of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
we manage the exposure of our japanese subsidiary to these fluctuations through forward contracts to hedge the subsidiary s purchase commitments 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to these currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  use hedging transactions to minimize the effect of these currency fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the future  we may need to sell our products in foreign currencies other than the japanese yen and the management of more currency fluctuations will be more difficult and expose us to greater risks in this area 
we are subject to many standards and regulations of foreign governments and  even though we intend to comply  we may not always be in compliance with these rules  or we may be unable to design or redesign our products to comply with these rules 
many foreign government standards and regulations apply to our products 
these standards and regulations are always being amended 
although we intend to meet all foreign standards and regulations  our products may not comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
further  it might not be cost effective for us to redesign our products to comply with these foreign government standards and regulations 
our inability to design products to comply with foreign standards therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities and subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
operations at our primary manufacturing facility and our subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  terrorism  fire  earthquake  energy shortages  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruptions could cause delays in shipments of our products to our customers 
we cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that  if it were available  it could be obtained on favorable terms 
such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
our operations are subject to environmental and other government regulations that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations  such as regulations related to the environment  land use  public utility utilization and the fire code  in connection with the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances that we use in our manufacturing process and on our facilities 
we believe that our activities comply with current government regulations that are applicable to our operations and current facilities 
we may be required to purchase additional capital equipment or other requirements for our processes to comply with these government regulations in the future if they change 
further  these government regulations may restrict us from expanding our operations 
adopting measures to comply with changes in the government regulations  our failure to comply with environmental and land use regulations  or restrictions on our ability to discharge hazardous substances  could subject us to future liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be reduced or stopped 
our products are subject to potential product liability claims if personal injury or death results from their use 
we are exposed to significant risks for product liability claims if personal injury or death results from the use of our products 
we may experience material product liability losses in the future 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims 
however  our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on terms that we accept 
this insurance coverage also may not adequately cover liabilities that we incur 
further  if our products are defective  we may be required to recall or redesign these products 
a successful claim against us that exceeds our insurance coverage level  or any claim or product recall that results in adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past 
the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including the risk factors contained in this report 
various factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  conditions and trends in the light source device and other technology industries  announcements of innovations in technology  new products offered by us or our competitor  developments of patents or proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general worldwide political  economic  and market conditions  us political  economic  and market conditions  and failure to properly manage any single or combination of risk factors listed in this section 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies 
such fluctuations have in some cases been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
severe price fluctuations in a company s stock have frequently been followed by securities litigation 
any such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
