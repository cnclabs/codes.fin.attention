management overview sharper image corporation referred to as the sharper image  sharper image  the company  we  us and our is a leading specialty retailer of innovative  high quality products that are useful and entertaining and are designed to make life easier and more enjoyable 
we market and sell our merchandise primarily through three integrated sales channels the sharper image stores  the sharper image catalog  which includes revenue from all direct marketing activities and infomercials  and the internet 
we also market to other businesses through our corporate sales  where revenues are recorded in each of our three sales channels and our wholesale operations 
our fiscal years are ended january  fiscal or  january  fiscal or  and january  fiscal or 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  many of which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note a to the financial statements 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the point of sale at our retail stores and at the time of customer receipt for our catalog and direct marketing sales  including the internet 
we recognize revenue for sales to resellers or sales made on a wholesale basis when title passes to the purchaser at the time the products are shipped 
estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns are recorded based on our historical return rates 
revenues are recorded net of sale discounts and other rebates and incentives offered to customers 
deferred revenue represents merchandise certificates  gift cards and reward cards outstanding and unfilled cash orders at the end of the fiscal period 
delivery revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
merchandise inventories 
we record inventory at lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the excess of the cost of inventory over the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
accounts receivable 
counterparties to our accounts receivable include credit card issuers  corporate marketing incentive customers  wholesale customers  installment plan customers  merchandise vendors  and landlords from whom we expect to receive amounts due 
an allowance for credit losses is recorded based on estimates of counterparties ability to pay 
if the financial condition of these counterparts deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those assets is less than the asset s carrying amount 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations and an operating unit level for our other operations 
our retail stores typically take months to achieve their full profit potential 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than management s projections  future write offs may be necessary 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events then known to 
table of contents management that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events then known to management are considered other than changes in the tax law or rates 
results of operations the company enjoyed excellent revenue growth in fiscal years and throughout these two and prior profitable years  two large and growing merchandise categories air purifiers which are developed in house and massage chairs from a third party maker accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
as described below  in aggregate net sales from these two product lines declined approximately million compared to and resulted in the first net loss the company has experienced in the past three years 
net sales for our other product lines  however  increased in by approximately million  largely driven by sales of new products and branded electronics 
the decrease in the sales of the company s air purifiers followed the release in april of news stories that included criticisms of the company s ionic breeze silent air purifiers 
these stories were widely distributed in the popular mass media  including television and newspapers 
the company publicly protested that the criticisms were unwarranted and untrue  and yet the negative effect on ionic breeze net revenues was sudden and significant 
the company responded promptly with product enhancements that were already in development  notably adding ozoneguard by august to minimize the already low  and us regulation compliant  by product trace level of ozone  and with inventory adjustments and price promotions 
the company s massage chair sales decrease by july resulted from the changes in the competitive landscape for massage chairs under  with numerous new catalog  internet and store retailers offering similar products 
the third party maker of all our under  massage chairs had greatly expanded their distribution of similar massage chairs  although with fewer features  to other sellers 
the negative effect on our massage chair sales was significant and sudden 
to offset the revenue declines  inventory was reduced and the chairs were offered at promotional prices throughout the balance of and into to meet the challenge presented by the sales declines in air purifiers and massage chairs  during the second half of fiscal and continuing into  the company sought to address several key areas through the following actions substantially reducing planned corporate overhead expenditures for  reducing corporate office and distribution center head count by more than and reducing store head count by at the end of compared to one year ago  reducing advertising expenditures by for the fourth quarter of and budgeting a further reduction in advertising for the fiscal year  including a planned decrease of in catalog circulation  a planned decrease of in single product solo mailer circulation  and a planned reduction in infomercial spending  although actual expenditures may differ from the budgeted amounts depending upon market conditions  reducing capital expenditures from approximately million in to a planned to million in  slowing planned new store openings to six to eight in  compared to in and in  eliminating commission based compensation for retail sales associates  replacing it with an hourly expense structure and establishing selling incentive programs that are more flexible  reducing january   inventory levels by approximately million as compared to january   maintaining a strong balance sheet  and accelerating new product introductions 

table of contents notwithstanding these initiatives  the company expects a net loss in the first quarter of fiscal that significantly exceeds the net loss in the first quarter of fiscal a summary of our operating results is presented below 
this discussion includes our results presented on the basis required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following table presents our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended january  fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues net store sales net catalog sales net internet sales net wholesale sales delivery list rental and licensing total revenues costs and expenses cost of products buying and occupancy advertising general  selling and administrative operating income loss other income expense earnings loss before income tax expense income tax expense benefit net earnings loss the following table presents the components of our revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended january  dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues net store sales net catalog and direct marketing sales net internet sales net wholesale sales total net sales list rental and licensing delivery total revenues year ended january  fiscal  compared to year ended january  fiscal revenues 
total revenue decreased million or from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease from fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to decreases of million in catalog and direct 
table of contents marketing sales  million from store sales  million in wholesale sales and million from internet sales 
the decrease in total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an approximately million decrease in net revenue from our air purification and our massage chair lines of products and decreased advertising spending  which generally affects sales in all selling channels  offset in part by an approximately million increase in net revenues  largely driven by sales of new products and branded electronics 
the decrease in the sale of our air purification products resulted from negative media coverage  increased competition and decreased advertising specifically designed for these products 
the decrease in our massage chair product line resulted from increased competition at lower price points for similar products 
a significant portion of our direct response advertising is devoted to the air purification product line 
we require a certain sales to advertising expenditure ratio to justify continued advertising and accordingly reduced direct response advertising expenditures as sales of these products slowed 
the popularity of our sharper image design and sharper image branded products continues to be a key factor in driving sales in all our selling channels 
sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products decreased to approximately of total revenues in fiscal from approximately for fiscal we believe that the decrease in the percentage of revenues attributable to sharper image design and sharper image branded products was due to decreased sales of our air purification line of products and sharper image branded massage chairs during the year as well as an increase in sales of brand name electronics 
we believe that the continued development and introduction of new and popular products is a key strategic objective and important to our future success 
returns and allowances for fiscal were of sales  as compared to for fiscal  resulting in a million decrease in revenues 
we believe that the increase in returns and allowances for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to negative media coverage surrounding our air purification line of products and higher return rates on certain first generation electronic and toy products 
net store sales for fiscal decreased million  or  while comparable store sales decreased by from fiscal the decrease in net store sales was attributable primarily to a decrease of in comparable store sales  a decrease in the average revenue per transaction and to promotional discounts relating to a portion of our new product introductions that proved less popular than those introduced in prior years 
the decreases in comparable store sales and in average revenue per transaction were primarily attributable to consumers lack of willingness to spend  the overall product mix offered  the decreases in sales of the air purification and massage chair product lines  and decreases in multimedia advertising  including infomercial advertising highlighting sharper image design and sharper image branded products  particularly air purification products that sell at relatively higher price points 
the decrease in net store sales was partially offset by the opening of new stores  net  during fiscal  resulting in a increase in total store transactions for fiscal average net sales per square foot for fiscal for all stores decreased to from in fiscal average net sales per square foot for our comparable store base for fiscal was as compared to in the same prior year period 
average net sales per square foot are calculated by averaging over all stores the amount of each store s net sales divided by that store s total square footage under lease 
average revenue per transaction is calculated by dividing the amount of gross sales  exclusive of delivery revenue and sales taxes  per channel by the gross number of transactions in that channel 
comparable store sales is not a measure that has been defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores where selling square feet did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least months 
a store opened on or prior to the th of a month is treated as open for the entire month 
stores generally become comparable once they have a full year of comparable sales for the annual calculation 
we believe that comparable store sales  which excludes the effect of a change in the number of stores open  provides a more useful measure of the performance of our store sales channel than does the absolute change in aggregate net store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to decreases in the sale of our air purification and our massage chair lines and difficult comparisons to high store volumes generated after several years of strong sales results 

table of contents net catalog and direct marketing sales  which includes direct sales generated from catalog mailings  single product mailers  print advertising and infomercials  decreased million or for fiscal from fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in sales of the company s air purification and massage chair line of products  a decrease of million or in infomercial advertising expense  a decrease in the sharper image catalog pages circulated  and a decrease in single product mailers circulated 
the decrease in net catalog and direct marketing sales for fiscal reflects a decrease in average revenue per transaction  and a decrease in transactions compared to fiscal for fiscal and  and of the net catalog and direct marketing sales were generated from infomercial direct sales 
we intend to continue our multimedia advertising programs during fiscal to attract new customers while achieving a favorable return on advertising investment 
our goal is to achieve direct response sales resulting in near breakeven results on all direct marketing advertising initiatives 
given our declining sales in fiscal  our current plan is to decrease overall direct marketing expenditures in fiscal by 
we continually review our advertising initiatives  including the pages and number of catalogs and single product mailers circulated  and the amount of and return on investment from infomercial advertising in our efforts to improve revenues from catalog and direct marketing advertising 
actual advertising expenses for fiscal may be higher or lower than our current plans 
net internet sales from our www 
sharperimage 
com website and the sharper image and ebay auction websites in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease was attributable primarily to an decrease in internet transactions and a decrease in average revenue per transaction partially attributable to lower sales of higher priced products such as the company s air purifier and massage chair line and a decrease in internet advertising which includes paid for search engine key word placement and revenue share costs incurred for affiliate programs 
net wholesale sales for fiscal year decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to decreasing sharper image design product sales  particularly air purifiers  to our existing wholesale customer base and to test programs with new wholesale customers 
we believe that the wholesale business  pursued with select partners  will continue to strengthen our brand name and broaden our customer base 
cost of products 
cost of products for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase is due primarily to changes in our merchandise mix 
the gross margin rate for fiscal was as compared to the fiscal rate of 
the decrease in the gross margin rate was a result of a combination of higher unit costs for certain third party products  primarily branded mp players  increases in promotional and incentive activities and product markdowns 
additionally  declining sales of our air purification line of products had a negative impact on our gross margins as these products generally carry higher than company average gross margins 
we also focused on managing down our inventory levels in the fourth quarter of and began aggressive promotional activities on many products  including air purification products and massage chair products 
these actions are continuing into our gross margin rate fluctuates with changes in our merchandise mix  primarily sharper image design and sharper image branded products  which changes as we make new items available in various categories or introduce new proprietary products 
the variation in merchandise mix from category to category from year to year is characteristic of sales results being driven by individual products rather than by general product lines 
additionally  the auction sites and other selected promotional activities such as free shipping offers negatively impact the gross margin rate 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include the costs related to their distribution network in cost of products while we  and other retailers  exclude them from gross margin and include them instead in general  selling and administrative expenses 
we cannot accurately predict future gross margin rates although our goal is to increase sales of sharper image design and sharper image branded products to capitalize on the higher margins realized on these products 

table of contents buying and occupancy 
buying and occupancy costs for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal this increase reflects a full year of occupancy costs for the new stores opened in fiscal  the occupancy costs associated with the new stores opened in fiscal and rent increases for some existing store locations upon lease renewal  partially offset by five store closures during fiscal buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from for fiscal primarily as a result of declining sales 
in fiscal  we opened a total of new stores 
our goal is to slow the pace of new store openings to approximately six to eight new stores in fiscal we cannot assure you we will achieve that number of store openings 
advertising 
advertising expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease in advertising expense was attributable primarily to a decrease of million  or  in infomercial advertising expense  a decrease in magazine and print advertising and a decrease in radio advertising 
also contributing to the decrease in advertising was a decrease in the number of the sharper image catalog pages circulated and a decrease in the number of solo mailers circulated 
although we believe these initiatives contributed to the decline in sales in the stores  catalog and direct marketing and internet channels  declining sales overall dictated that we reduce advertising spending in and there can be no assurance of the future success of these advertising initiatives 
general  selling and administrative 
general  selling and administrative gs a expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal contributing to this was a decrease of approximately million due primarily to variable expenses from lower net sales 
also contributing were decreases of million for distribution center shipping costs incurred for product delivery to our retail store locations and for airfreight costs due to the west coast port slowdown that were not incurred in the current year and million for professional fees  including legal and accounting fees resulting from sarbanes oxley compliance 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million for depreciation and amortization expense 
gs a expenses for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues increased to  as compared to for fiscal  primarily due to declining sales partially offset by cost savings described above 
to address the challenges of lower sales in fiscal during the second half of fiscal  the company acted vigorously to reduce our expense structure  notably in store and corporate payroll  advertising spending and other general and administrative expenses 
these expense reduction initiatives were expanded as we planned our fiscal budget  which includes further store and corporate payroll savings  including a redesign of our store compensation program whereby the sales associates commission programs are replaced with a base pay plus incentive structure  reductions in officers salaries and board of directors fees  and further general and administrative expense reductions 
other income expense 
the decrease is primarily due to higher interest income earned in fiscal due to higher interest rates  partially offset by lower average investment balances in fiscal compared to and higher interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit as borrowings for the holiday season were significantly higher in income taxes 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the higher tax benefit rate in fiscal is primarily the result of a federal research and development tax credit accepted by the irs and recorded by the company in fiscal year ended january  fiscal  compared to year ended january  fiscal 
revenues 
total revenue increased million or from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the opening of net new stores during fiscal  increases in net wholesale sales and net internet sales and  to a lesser extent  the decrease in returns and allowances described below 
the popularity of our sharper image design and sharper image branded products continues to be a key factor in the increases in total revenues in all our selling channels 
sales of 
table of contents sharper image design and sharper image branded products increased to approximately of total revenues in fiscal from approximately for fiscal we believe that the increase in the percentage of revenues attributable to sharper image design and sharper image branded products was due to the modification of certain third party branded products to make them exclusive to sharper image branded product offerings  the introduction of the professional series line of ionic breeze silent air purifiers in the third fiscal quarter of  and other key sharper image design proprietary products 
we believe that the continued development and introduction of new and popular products is a key strategic objective and important to our future success 
the increase in net sales was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal we also believe that the increased investment in our advertising initiatives in fiscal and  which include the significant increase in infomercial advertising and internet advertising  primarily highlighting selected sharper image design and sharper image branded products and the increase in catalogs circulated contributed to the higher revenues in all selling channels 
returns and allowances for fiscal were sales  as compared to for fiscal  resulting in a million increase in total revenues in all selling channels 
we believe that the decrease in returns and allowances for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to improved quality control in the production of various top selling sharper image branded products that have resulted from improvements made in response to customer feedback and lower return rates on certain electronic products 
net store sales for fiscal increased million  or  while comparable store sales decreased by from fiscal the increase in net store sales was attributable primarily to the opening of new stores during fiscal  a increase in total store transactions for fiscal and a increase in the average revenue per transaction  as compared to fiscal the increase in net store sales was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal  a soft economy marked by consumers lack of willingness to spend  some new production introductions that proved less popular than anticipated  and congestion at west coast ports  particularly in the fourth quarter  which generated extra freight costs and caused a shortage of key holiday items during critical selling weeks  and the closure of two stores at lease maturity 
the increase in average revenue per transaction was attributable primarily to the overall product mix offered  and multimedia advertising strategies  including infomercial advertising highlighting sharper image design and sharper image branded products  particularly our air purification products 
average net sales per square foot for fiscal for all stores decreased to from in fiscal average net sales per square foot for the company s comparable store base for fiscal was as compared to in the same prior year period 
average net sales per square foot is calculated by averaging over all stores the amount of each store s net sales divided by that store s total square footage under lease

we believe that comparable store sales  which excludes the effect of a change in the number of stores open  provides a more useful measure of the performance of our store sales channel than does the absolute change in aggregate net store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower than optimal inventory levels of popular merchandise  product introductions that did not generate high demands during the fiscal year and high consumer demand for other popular gift items not available during the holiday season 
net catalog and direct marketing sales  which include direct sales generated from catalog mailings  single product mailers  print advertising and infomercials  for fiscal increased million or  from fiscal this increase was due primarily to a increase in infomercial advertising expense  a increase in the sharper image catalog pages circulated  which includes a increase in the sharper image catalogs

the acceleration does not apply to unexpired options held by former employees 
the accelerated vesting is expected to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our income statement with respect to such accelerated options due to our adoption of fasb statement no
