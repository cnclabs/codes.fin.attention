item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions 
we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our previously acquired companies  which may be substantial 
additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment  relocation and retention  including salary increases or bonuses  accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments  reorganization or closure of facilities  taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services 
some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the united states 
our international operations include software development  sales  customer support and shared administrative service centers 
we are subject to a variety of risks  including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region  regulatory changes  political unrest  terrorism and the potential for other hostilities  particularly in areas in which we have significant operations 
we face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  overlapping tax regimes  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
we must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances  changes in tariff rates and import and export licensing requirements 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 
we are a majority shareholder of i flex solutions limited  a publicly traded indian software company focused on the banking industry 
as the majority shareholder of an international entity  we are faced with several additional risks  including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  japanese yen and british pound relative to the united states dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results 

table of contents our foreign currency transaction gains and losses  primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors  are charged against earnings in the period incurred 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies  but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 
oracle on demand may not be successful 
we offer oracle on demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology  delivered either at oracle or at a customer designated location 
oracle on demand also includes several product lines we have acquired 
our oracle on demand business model continues to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively  generate significant revenues or develop oracle on demand into a profitable business 
this business is subject to a variety of risks including demand for these services may not meet our expectations  we may not be able to operate this business at an acceptable profit level  we manage critical customer applications  data and other confidential information through oracle on demand and thus would face increased exposure to significant damage claims in the event of system failures or inadequate disaster recovery or misappropriation of customer confidential information  we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy  data security and export compliance  as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their information technology functions to us  the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled  particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of offshore resources  changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the cost and risk associated with providing the services  and our oracle on demand offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers  computers  network infrastructure and security 
we may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees 
we rely on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel 
in addition  acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at oracle 
we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel 
with rare exceptions  we do not have long term employment or non competition agreements with our employees 
members of our senior management team have left oracle over the years for a variety of reasons  and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures  which may be disruptive to our operations 
part of our total compensation program includes stock options 
if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees 
in addition  since we will expense all stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  we may change both our cash and stock based compensation practices 
some of the changes we are considering include the reduction in the number of employees granted options  a reduction in the number of options granted and a change to alternative forms of stock based compensation 
any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
we might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services 
despite testing prior to their release  software products frequently contain errors or security flaws  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products  could delay the development or release of new products or new 
table of contents versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
if we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products  we could lose revenues 
in addition  we run our own business operations  oracle on demand  and other outsourcing  support and consulting services  on our products and networks and any security flaws  if exploited  could affect our ability to conduct business operations 
end users  who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses  may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally 
software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability  performance and or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 
the detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle 
we have and expect to continue making significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all 
our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination  audits  investigations  sanctions and penalties 
we derive revenues from contracts with the united states government  state and local governments and their respective agencies  who may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies  both domestically and internationally  to reduce spending 
our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts 
similarly  our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  refund of a portion of fees received  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 
for example  there is a pending us government investigation of peoplesoft s pricing practices prior to our acquisition under multiple award schedule contracts 
while we do not believe that this investigation will result in material damages  we could be subject to similar investigations or actions in the future 
business disruptions could affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services  including some of our on demand offerings 
a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the irs and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject 
table of contents to additional audits in the future 
we previously negotiated three unilateral advance pricing agreements with the irs that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the irs from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements 
however  these agreements  which are effective for fiscal years through may   do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the united states 
we have finalized one bilateral advance pricing agreement and currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from june  through may  there can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
our acquisition activities have increased our non income tax exposures 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

we repaid these borrowings in fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends 
this overview is followed by a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
we then provide a more detailed analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we are the world s largest enterprise software company 
we are organized into two businesses  software and services  which are further divided into five operating segments 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in united states dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than united states dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our five operating segments follows 
software business our software business is comprised of two operating segments new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues 
we expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase  which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development 
new software licenses we license our database  middleware and applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
the growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions 
the new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software revenues on a trailing quarter period provides more visibility into the underlying fundamental performance of our software revenues than analysis of quarterly revenues 
new software license margins have been affected by amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions 
competition in the software business is intense 
our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors 
we believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been 
we have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration  decreasing installation times  lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use 
reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their investment  which we believe will create more demand and provide us with a competitive advantage 
we have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels 
we believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers leading technology advisor 
software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually  thereby eliminating the need to repurchase new software licenses when new upgrades are released 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is influenced by four factors the support contract base of companies acquired the renewal rate of the support contract base  the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and inflationary support price increases 

table of contents software license updates and product support revenues  which represent approximately of our total revenues on a trailing quarter basis  is our highest margin business unit 
support margins over the last trailing quarters were  and account for of our total margins over the same respective period 
we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons acquisitions over the past two years have significantly increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed 
substantially all customers purchase license updates and product support subscriptions when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support subscription contract base 
even if license revenue growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to the support contract base 
substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal 
when support contract renewals are negotiated  inflationary price increases are assessed  where applicable 
we record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
services business our services business consists of consulting  on demand and education revenues 
our services business  which represents of our total revenues on a trailing quarter basis  has significantly lower margins than our software business 
consulting consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses 
consulting revenues have been negatively impacted in recent periods for the following reasons continued attrition of personnel due to a demand for technical talent in certain markets  particularly in the united states 
a shift in the mix of resources to lower cost countries  which has resulted in a decrease in average billing rates 
our decision to work more closely with partners who perform implementations of our software 
despite these trends  we expect consulting revenues to increase in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in application implementations related to acquired products and the addition of personnel acquired from siebel 
on demand on demand includes our oracle on demand software as a service and outsourcing offerings as well as advanced customer services 
we believe that our on demand offerings provide an additional opportunity for customers to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage 
we will continue to make investments in oracle on demand to support current and future revenue growth  which may negatively impact future on demand margins 
education the purpose of our education services is to further enhance the usability of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow software revenues 
education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
despite these trends  we expect education revenues to increase in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in customer training on the use of our acquired application products 

table of contents operating margins we continually focus on improving our operating margins by providing our customers with superior products and services as well as improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 
as part of this effort  we continually evaluate our workforce and make adjustments where we deem appropriate 
when we make adjustments to our workforce  we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure  but we believe that the fundamental shift towards globalization is crucial to maintaining a long term competitive cost structure 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy 
in the last two years  we have paid an aggregate of billion for our acquisitions  which included the following in january  we acquired siebel  a provider of customer relationship management software for approximately billion 
we completed the substantial majority of our planned legal entity mergers  information system conversions and integration of siebel s operations and expect to finalize all other planned integration activities in the next three months  in january  we acquired peoplesoft  a provider of enterprise application software products for approximately billion 
we completed our planned legal entity mergers  information system conversions and integration of peoplesoft s operations in the first half of fiscal we believe our recent acquisitions support our long term strategic direction  strengthen our competitive position  particularly in the applications market  expand our customer base and provide greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation  increase stockholder value and grow our earnings 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
we believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our commercial paper program  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following business combinations peoplesoft customer assurance program goodwill revenue recognition 
table of contents accounting for income taxes legal contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts and returns in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal and  respectively 
historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal 
to the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
had we included our estimated selling and research and development activities  and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements  the fair value of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we have recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenue historically and in future periods related to these assumed contracts 

table of contents other significant estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are primarily comprised of severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management but which are subject to refinement 
to estimate restructuring expenses  management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan 
decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely  whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date and as operating expenses thereafter 
changes in cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with our pre merger activities are recorded in restructuring expenses 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if  as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment that results from a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
peoplesoft customer assurance program as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in june  in response to our tender offer  peoplesoft implemented what it referred to as the customer assurance program or cap 
the cap incorporated a provision in peoplesoft s standard licensing arrangement that purports contractually to burden oracle  as a result of our acquisition of peoplesoft  with a contingent obligation to make payments to peoplesoft customers should we fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period  which typically expires four years from the date of the contract 
we have concluded that  as of the date of the acquisition  the penalty provisions under the cap represent a contingent liability of oracle 
we have not recorded a liability related to the cap  as we do not believe it is probable that our post acquisition activities related to the peoplesoft and jd edwards product lines will trigger an obligation to make any payment pursuant to the cap 
the maximum potential penalty under the cap as of may  was billion 
unless the cap provisions are removed from these licensing arrangements  we do not expect the aggregate potential cap obligation to decline substantially until fiscal year when these provisions begin to expire 
while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of potential litigation  we believe we would also have substantial defenses with respect to the legality and enforceability of the cap contract provisions in response to any claims seeking payment from oracle under the cap terms 
if we determine in the future that a payment pursuant to the cap is probable  the estimated liability would be recorded in our operating results in the period in which such liability is determined 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of statement require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the following sources software  which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues  and services  which include consulting  on demand and education revenues 
new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support  which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses 
in addition  substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
we recognize no more than of the milestone or total contract amount until project acceptance is obtained 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized 
table of contents when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions  then new software license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees  where services include significant modification or customization of the software  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
on demand is comprised of oracle on demand and advanced customer services 
oracle on demand provides multi featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database  middleware and applications software 
advanced customer services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis  personalized support and annual on site technical services 
revenues from on demand services are recognized over the term of the service contract  which is generally one year 
education revenues include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance with fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
if acceptance provisions are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of returns  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 

table of contents we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software licenses and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of non acceptance is remote  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net  however  terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions 
we account for the sale of these receivables as true sales as defined in fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies a concurrent transaction 
software license agreements that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we recognize new software license revenue from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized new software license revenues of approximately million from a supplier 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we negotiated to acquire goods and services from this supplier and finalized terms of the purchase 
the value of the goods and services we will acquire from this supplier under this agreement will total approximately million over the next five years 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 

table of contents remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded 
amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense as part of the purchase price allocation 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents stock based compensation up until may   we measured compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
we were required to adopt the provisions of fasb statement r  share based payment  in the first quarter of fiscal although the adoption of statement r s fair value method has no adverse impact on our balance sheet or total cash flows  it affects our operating expenses  net income and earnings per share 
the actual effects of adopting statement r will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates 
we estimate that stock based compensation expense will reduce diluted earnings per share by to in fiscal allowances for doubtful accounts and returns we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are recorded at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 

table of contents results of operations the fluctuations in operating results of oracle in fiscal compared to fiscal are generally due to acquisitions  principally our acquisition of peoplesoft in the third quarter of fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of siebel in the third quarter of fiscal and retek  inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of peoplesoft  siebel and retek products to growth in new software license revenues  the amount of revenues associated with peoplesoft and siebel software license updates and product support and on demand services and present supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting where applicable 
although certain revenues were quantifiable  we are unable to identify consulting and education revenues of siebel in our fourth quarter of fiscal as well as allocate costs associated with the peoplesoft and siebel products and services in fiscal because the substantial majority of former peoplesoft and siebel sales and services personnel were fully integrated into our existing operations 
we caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantification cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts  in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer the oracle and peoplesoft product families on a neutral basis and the integration of siebel into our crm sales force 
the commissions earned by our integrated sales force in these integrations did not vary based on the application product family sold 
we believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of oracle  peoplesoft and siebel products sold would have been different 
the acquisitions of peoplesoft and siebel did not result in our entering a new line of business or product category 
therefore  we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality 
although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal  amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to present this information  current and prior year results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect on may   which was the last day of our prior fiscal year  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect revenues of million in fiscal using as the exchange rate and million in fiscal using as the exchange rate 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the periods

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations  or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation 
year ended may  dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes effective tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes increased in fiscal due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective tax rate 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily attributable to a higher percentage of earnings in high tax jurisdictions as compared with other lower tax rate jurisdictions 
in addition  we did not benefit from certain non recurring tax events in fiscal that occurred in fiscal  as described below  and we incurred higher non deductible in process research and development charges in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes decreased due to a lower effective tax rate  partially offset by higher earnings before tax 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily attributable to higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions 
in addition  the fiscal effective tax rate was favorably impacted by due to the settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitation on assessments and the true up of estimated tax accruals upon filing of prior year tax returns 
partially reducing this benefit was an increase to our effective tax rate of in fiscal for the dividend pursuant to the american jobs creation act of as well as acquisition and restructuring costs related to non deductible expenses resulting from in process research and development charges and additional taxes associated with tender offer costs incurred from june  to december  for peoplesoft that  upon acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal  had to be capitalized into the basis of the stock for tax purposes 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
at may   the cumulative earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided for were approximately billion 
if these earnings were repatriated in the united states  they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend 
assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits  the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings would be approximately million 
in fiscal  we repatriated billion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries in accordance with the american jobs creation act of and recorded a federal tax expense of million and a state tax expense net of federal tax benefit of million 
we repatriated the maximum amount available for repatriation under the american jobs creation act of this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested 
liquidity and capital resources may  dollars in millions change change working capital cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital the increase in working capital in fiscal is primarily due to the billion long term senior notes issued in january as well as greater cash flows from operations from higher sales volumes  partially offset by cash used to pay for acquisitions and to reduce other debt obligations

the decline in days sales outstanding is due to more timely collections as well as a shift in the mix of total revenues

table of contents license updates and product support revenues are generally billed one year in advance  while the revenues are recognized ratably over the annual contract period

year ended may  dollars in millions change change cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by used for financing activities cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements 
payments from customers for software license updates and product support are generally received by the beginning of the contract term  which is generally one year in length 
we also generate significant cash from new software license sales and  to a lesser extent  services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  payment of taxes  facilities and technology costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher net income  excluding non cash charges  partially offset by increased accounts receivables due to fourth quarter fiscal revenue growth 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to higher net income  excluding non cash charges  and increases in non acquisition related deferred revenues  partially offset by the payment of liabilities assumed in connection with the peoplesoft acquisition 
cash flows from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth

cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments under debt obligations as well as stock repurchase activity 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal primarily due to higher stock repurchases  partially offset by higher net borrowings 
we increased our share repurchases in fiscal due to the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in connection with our siebel acquisition 
we intend to continue to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase programs 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal we generated cash flow from financing activities in fiscal as a result of net borrowings of billion primarily used to pay for the acquisition of peoplesoft 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we borrowed billion under a bridge loan to fund the acquisition of peoplesoft and repaid the entire balance as of may  with cash flows from operations  proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities  the repatriation of foreign earnings and new borrowings 
we borrowed billion under a billion commercial paper program and million under a day loan facility through a wholly owned subsidiary in the fourth quarter of fiscal free cash flow to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap measures of cash flows on a trailing quarter basis to analyze cash flow generated from operations 
we believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors 
the presentation of non gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity

we generally sell such contracts on a non recourse basis to financial institutions 
we record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets

we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the new cp program at may  in march  we entered into a new billion  year revolving credit agreement new credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association  bank of america  na and certain other lenders 
the new credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility which can be used to backstop any commercial paper that we may issue and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures  contractual obligations and investment needs 
in addition  we believe we could fund other acquisitions and repurchase common stock with our internally available cash and investments  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our credit facilities  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
quarterly results of operations quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors  including sales compensation plans 
these seasonal factors are common in the software industry 
these factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically  has been the highest quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding 
fiscal quarter ended unaudited in millions  except per share amounts august november february may revenues gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted fiscal quarter ended unaudited in millions  except per share amounts august november february may revenues gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted stock options our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution for each of the last three full fiscal years has been less than and has averaged per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year  net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised 
many of these options  which have year exercise periods  have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historic practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
over the last years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions or to repay indebtedness 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was 
the compensation committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the organization wide stock option grants to selected employees  all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of  shares

 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r generally requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition is no longer an alternative 
on april   the securities and exchange commission announced that the statement r effective transition date would be extended to annual periods beginning after june  we adopted the provisions of statement r under the modified prospective method in our first quarter of fiscal under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of adoption and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of adoption that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
statement r also requires a portion of the benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 

table of contents as permitted by statement  we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method up to may  although the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or total cash flows  it will affect our net income and earnings per share 
the actual effects of adopting statement r will depend on numerous factors including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates 
we estimate that stock based compensation expense will reduce diluted earnings per share by to in fiscal as a result of the adoption of statement r 
accounting changes and error corrections on june   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
statement is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of statement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  interpretation provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of interpretation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income rate risk 
based on our intentions regarding our investments  we classify our investments as either held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity investments are reported on the balance sheet at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are reported at market value 
auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale  are reported on the balance sheet at par value  which equals market value  as the rate on such securities re sets generally every to days 
as a majority of our investments are held to maturity  interest rate movements do not affect the balance sheet valuation of the fixed income investments 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments 
for fiscal  total interest income was million with investments yielding an average on a worldwide basis 
this interest rate level was up approximately basis points from for fiscal if overall interest rates fell by a similar amount basis points in fiscal  our interest income would decline approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels

we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the interest obligations associated with our senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes variable based on the three month libor set quarterly until maturity 
foreign currency transaction risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts excluding our yen equity hedge described below are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in non operating income  net 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature

table of contents net investment risk 
periodically  we hedge the net assets of certain international subsidiaries net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries 
we measure the effectiveness of net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies  the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries 
under this method  the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates the effective portion is reported in stockholders equity to offset the translation results on the net investments 
the remaining change in fair value of the forward contract the ineffective portion is recognized in non operating income  net 
at may   we had one net investment hedge in japanese yen 
the yen investment hedge minimizes currency risk arising from net assets held in yen as a result of equity capital raised during the initial public offering and secondary offering of oracle japan 
the fair value of our yen investment hedge was nominal as of may  and the yen investment hedge has a notional amount of million and an exchange rate of yen per united states dollar
