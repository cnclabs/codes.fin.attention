inherent in the entertainment software industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records obsolescence and any adjustments to market value if lower than cost based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last date a physical inventory was performed to the end of the fiscal year

physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly
