supervision and regulation banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
consequently  the company s growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by decisions of management and national and local economic conditions  but also by the statutes administered by  and the regulations and policies of  various governmental authorities 
these authorities include  but are not limited to  the federal reserve  the fdic  the tdb  united states department of treasury the treasury department  the internal revenue service and state taxing authorities 
the primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the banking industry 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to the bank and the company establishes a comprehensive framework for the company s operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance funds  the bank s depositors and the public  rather than the company s shareholders and creditors 
the following summarizes some of the relevant laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies  but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws  rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies 
the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed 
the company bank holding company act 
as bank holding companies under the bank holding company act of  as amended  the company and southside delaware are registered with and subject to regulation by the federal reserve 
the company and southside delaware are both required to file annual and other reports with  and furnish information to  the federal reserve  which makes periodic inspections of the company and southside delaware 
the bank holding company act provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve i for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company  ii for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company or iii in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
the bank holding company act also provides that  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company may not engage in any activities other than those of banking or managing or controlling banks and other authorized subsidiaries or own or control more than five percent of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank 
the federal reserve has deemed limited activities to be closely related to banking and therefore permissible for a bank holding company 
as discussed below  the gramm leach bliley act  which was enacted in  established a new type of bank holding company known as a financial holding company that has powers that are not otherwise available to bank holding companies 
the bank holding company act restricts the extension of credit to any bank holding company by its subsidiary bank 
federal regulatory agencies also have authority to regulate debt obligations other than commercial paper issued by bank holding companies 
this authority includes the power to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
the federal reserve has cease and desist powers over bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety  soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank 
gramm leach bliley act 
traditionally  the activities of bank holding companies had been limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking 
the gramm leach bliley financial services act of glba  which became effective on march   amended the bank holding company act and removed certain legal barriers separating the conduct of various types of financial services businesses 
in addition  glba substantially revamped the regulatory scheme within which financial institutions operate 
under glba  bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a financial holding company 
a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature  as well as additional activities that the federal reserve or treasury department determine are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities 
under glba  financial activities specifically include insurance  securities underwriting and dealing  merchant banking  investment advisory and lending activities 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company under glba if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdic improvement act prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the bank holding company must file a declaration with the federal reserve that the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company 
a bank holding company that falls out of compliance with these requirements may be required to cease engaging in some of its activities 
in a similar manner  glba expanded the types of activities in which a bank may engage 
generally  a bank may engage in activities that are financial in nature through a financial subsidiary if the bank and each of its depository institution affiliates are well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
however  applicable law and regulation provide that the amount of investment in these activities generally are limited to of the total assets of the bank  and these investments are not aggregated with the bank for determining compliance with capital adequacy guidelines 
further  the transactions between the bank and this type of subsidiary are subject to a number of limitations 
under glba  the federal reserve serves as the primary umbrella regulator of financial holding companies  with supervisory authority over each parent company and limited authority over its subsidiaries 
expanded financial activities of financial holding companies generally will be regulated according to the type of such financial activity banking activities by banking regulators  securities activities by securities regulators and insurance activities by insurance regulators 
glba also imposes additional restrictions and heightened disclosure requirements regarding private information collected by financial institutions 
the company has not elected to become a financial holding company and to conduct the broader activities permitted under glba 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not make such an election in the future 
interstate banking 
federal banking law generally provides that a bank holding company may acquire or establish banks in any state of the united states  subject to certain age and deposit concentration limits 
in addition  texas banking laws permit a bank holding company that owns stock of a bank located outside the state of texas to acquire a bank or bank holding company located in texas 
this type of acquisition may occur only if the texas bank to be directly or indirectly controlled by the out of state bank holding company has existed and continuously operated as a bank for a period of at least five years 
in any event  a bank holding company may not own or control banks in texas the deposits of which would exceed of the total deposits of all federally insured deposits in texas 
the company has no present plans to acquire or establish banks outside the state of texas but has not eliminated the possibility of doing so 
sound banking practice 
bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices 
for example  the federal reserve s regulation y requires a bank holding company to give the federal reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the bank holding company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
as another example  a bank holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non banking subsidiaries or their customers if the federal reserve believed it not prudent to do so 
the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  or firrea  expanded the federal reserve s authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations 
firrea increased the amount of civil money penalties which the federal reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues 
firrea expanded the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed 
anti tying restrictions 
bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services  such as extensions of credit  to other services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates 
capital adequacy 
the federal reserve monitors the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  such as southside delaware and the company  and the fdic monitors the capital adequacy of the bank 
the federal bank regulators use a combination of risk based guidelines and leverage ratios to evaluate capital adequacy and consider the company s and the bank s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the company and the bank 
the federal reserve s capital adequacy regulations are based upon a risk based capital determination  whereby a bank holding company s capital adequacy is determined in light of the risk  both on and off balance sheet  contained in the bank holding company s assets 
different categories of assets are assigned risk weightings and are counted at a percentage of their book value 
the regulations divide capital between tier capital core capital and tier capital 
for a bank holding company  tier capital consists primarily of common stock  related surplus  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative preferred securities 
goodwill and certain other intangibles are excluded from tier capital 
tier capital consists of an amount equal to the allowance for loan and lease losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  limited other types of preferred stock not included in tier capital  hybrid capital instruments and term subordinated debt 
investments in and loans to unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that constitute capital of those subsidiaries are excluded from capital 
the sum of tier and tier capital constitutes qualifying total capital  and the tier component must comprise at least of qualifying total capital 
under regulatory capital guidelines  the company must maintain a minimum tier capital ratio of at least and a minimum total capital ratio of at least 
in addition  banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage capital ratio of at least for the most highly rated  financially sound banks and bank holding companies and a minimum leverage ratio of at least for all other banks 
as of december   the company s total risk based capital ratio was  the company s tier risk based capital ratio was and the company s leverage capital ratio was 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory level  without significant reliance on intangible assets and that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of tier capital  less intangibles not deducted from tier capital  to quarterly average total assets 
as of december   the federal reserve had not advised the company of any specific minimum tangible tier leverage ratio applicable to the company 
dividends 
as a bank holding company that does not  as an entity  currently engage in separate business activities of a material nature  the company s ability to pay cash dividends depends upon the cash dividends it receives from the bank through southside delaware 
the company s sources of income are dividends paid by the bank 
the company must pay all of its operating expenses from funds the company receives from the bank 
therefore  shareholders may receive dividends from the company only to the extent that funds are available after payment of the company s operating expenses 
in addition  in november the federal reserve adopted a policy statement concerning payment of cash dividends  which generally prohibits bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of operating earnings  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the company is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that the company maintain an adequate level of capital as described above and serve as a source of strength for the bank 
change in bank control act 
under the change in bank control act  persons who intend to acquire control of a bank holding company  either directly or indirectly  must give days prior notice to the federal reserve 
control would exist when an acquiring party directly or indirectly has control of at least of the company s voting securities or the power to direct the management or policies of the company 
under federal reserve regulations  a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where  after the transaction  the acquiring party has ownership control or the power to vote at least but less than of the company s voting securities 
the bank the bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of texas  and to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the tdb and the fdic 
the tdb and the fdic have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations 
these requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the bank 
regulation of lending activities 
loans made by the bank are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations  including the truth in lending act  the federal consumer credit protection act  the texas finance code  the texas deceptive trade practices act  the equal credit opportunity act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the fair credit reporting act  and the flood disaster protection act 
remedies to the borrower or consumer and penalties to the bank are provided if the bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations 
the scope and requirements of these laws and regulations have expanded significantly in recent years 
dividends 
all dividends paid by the bank are paid to the company  the sole indirect shareholder of the bank  through southside delaware 
the general dividend policy of the bank is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations 
the dividend policy of the bank is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the bank and will depend upon such factors as future earnings  financial conditions  cash needs  capital adequacy  compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions 
the ability of the bank  as a texas banking association  to pay dividends is restricted under applicable law and regulations 
the bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the texas banking commissioner 
all dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including losses and provisions for loan losses 
the fdic has the right to prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank where the payment is deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the bank is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirements that it maintain an adequate level of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by the fdic 
the exact amount of future dividends on the stock of the bank will be a function of the profitability of the bank in general  applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of the board of directors of the bank 
the bank s ability to pay dividends in the future will directly depend on the bank s future profitability  which cannot be accurately estimated or assured 
capital adequacy 
in  the federal banking regulators promulgated capital adequacy regulations to which all national and state banks  such as the bank  are subject 
these requirements are similar to the federal reserve requirements promulgated with respect to bank holding companies discussed previously 
the fdic requires a minimum leverage ratio of of adjusted total assets for the highest rated banks 
other banks are required to meet a leverage standard of or more  determined on a case by case basis 
at december   the bank was well capitalized and had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a leverage capital ratio of 
on december   the minimum ratio for qualifying total risk based capital was of which must be tier capital 
southside bank s actual capital to total assets and risk based capital ratios at december  were in excess of the minimum requirements 
also see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources 
prompt corrective action 
banks are subject to restrictions on their activities depending on their level of capital 
the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations divides banks into five different categories  depending on their level of capital 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a core capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more  and if the bank is not subject to an order or capital directive to meet and maintain a certain capital level 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a core capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more unless it receives the highest composite rating at its most recent examination and is not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  in which instance it must maintain a leverage ratio of or more 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a core capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than 
under these regulations  a bank is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a risk based capital ratio of less than  a core capital ratio of less than and a leverage ratio of less than 
under such regulations  a bank is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 
in addition  the fdic has the ability to downgrade a bank s classification but not to critically undercapitalized based on other considerations even if the bank meets the capital guidelines 
if a state nonmember bank  such as the bank  is classified as undercapitalized  the bank is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the fdic 
an undercapitalized bank is prohibited from increasing its assets  engaging in a new line of business  acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution  or opening or acquiring a new branch office  except under certain circumstances  including the acceptance by the fdic of a capital restoration plan for the bank 
if a state nonmember bank is classified as undercapitalized  the fdic may take certain actions to correct the capital position of the bank 
if a bank is classified as significantly undercapitalized  the fdic would be required to take one or more prompt corrective actions 
these actions would include  among other things  requiring sales of new securities to bolster capital  improvements in management  limits on interest rates paid  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  termination of certain risky activities and restrictions on compensation paid to executive officers 
if a bank is classified as critically undercapitalized  the bank must be placed into conservatorship or receivership within days  unless the fdic determines otherwise 
the capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by the bank 
the fdic is required to conduct a full scope  on site examination of every bank at least once every twelve months 
banks also may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits  depending on their capital classification 
well capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits  but all banks that are not well capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods served by the bank 
the community reinvestment act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
on a periodic basis  the fdic is charged with preparing a written evaluation of the bank s record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating 
the bank regulatory agencies will take that record into account in their evaluation of any application made by the bank or the company for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
an unsatisfactory community reinvestment act rating may be used as the basis to deny an application 
in addition  as discussed above  a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks have a community reinvestment act rating of at least satisfactory 
the bank was last examined for compliance with the community reinvestment act on april  and received a rating of outstanding 
deposit insurance 
the bank s deposits are insured up to  per depositor by the bank insurance fund 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by the bank 
the fdic assesses insurance premiums on a bank s deposits at a variable rate depending on the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the bank 
the fdic determines the deposit insurance assessment rates on the basis of the bank s capital classification and supervisory evaluations 
there is currently a basis point spread between the highest and the lowest assessment rates  so that banks classified as strongest were subject in to assessment  and banks classified as weakest were subject to an assessment rate of 
in addition to the insurance assessment  each insured bank was subject in to an assessment on deposits to service debt issued by the financing corporation  a federal agency established to finance the recapitalization of the former federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
under these assessment criteria  the bank was required to pay annual deposit premiums to the bank insurance fund in the bank s deposits insurance assessments may increase or decrease depending upon the risk assessment classification to which the bank is assigned by the federal deposits insurance corporation 
any increase in insurance assessments could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings 
usa patriot act 
following the events of september   president bush  on october   signed into law the united and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of also known as the usa patriot act  the law enhances the powers of the federal government and law enforcement organizations to combat terrorism  organized crime and money laundering 
the usa patriot act significantly amends and expands the application of the bank secrecy act  including enhanced measures regarding customer identity  new suspicious activity reporting rules and enhanced anti money laundering programs 
under the act  each financial institution is required to establish and maintain anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs  which include  at a minimum  the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test programs 
in addition  the act requires the bank regulatory agencies to consider the record of a bank or bank holding company in combating money laundering activities in their evaluation of bank and bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions 
on april   the treasury department issued regulations under the usa patriot act 
the regulations state that a depository institution will be deemed in compliance with the act provided it continues to comply with the current bank secrecy act regulations 
transactions with affiliates 
transactions between the bank and any of their affiliates including the company are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution is not treated as an affiliate of a bank for purposes of sections a and b unless it engages in activities not permissible for a national bank to engage in directly 
generally  sections a and b i limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus  and ii require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transaction includes the making of loans to an affiliate  the purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate  the purchase of assets from an affiliate  the issuance of a guarantee for the benefit of an affiliate  and similar transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the bank is also restricted in the loans that it may make to its executive officers  and directors  the executive officers and directors of the company  any owner of or more of its stock or the stock of the company  and certain entities affiliated with any such person 
on october   the federal reserve issued a new regulation  regulation w  effective april   that comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act  which are intended to protect insured depository institutions from suffering losses arising from transactions with affiliates 
the regulation unifies and updates staff interpretations issued over the years  incorporates several new interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate and addresses new issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of nonbanking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies in recent years and authorized for financial holding companies under glba 
branch banking 
pursuant to the texas finance code  all banks located in texas are authorized to branch statewide 
accordingly  a bank located anywhere in texas has the ability  subject to regulatory approval  to establish branch facilities near any of the bank s facilities and within the bank s market area 
if other banks were to establish branch facilities near the bank s facilities  it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on the business of the bank 
in  congress adopted the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of that statute provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching  subject to certain aging and deposit concentration limits that may be imposed under applicable state laws 
texas law permits interstate branching in two manners  with certain exceptions 
first  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas may establish a branch in the state of texas by acquiring a financial institution located in texas that is at least five years old  so long as the resulting institution and its affiliates would not hold more than of the total deposits in the state after the acquisition 
in addition  a financial institution with its main office outside of texas generally may establish a branch in the state of texas on a de novo basis if the financial institution s main office is located in a state that would permit texas institutions to establish a branch on a de novo basis in that state 
the fdic has adopted regulations under the reigle neal act to prohibit an out of state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production 
these regulations include guidelines to insure that interstate branches operated by an out of state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the out of state bank 
enforcement authority 
the federal banking laws also contain civil and criminal penalties available for use by the appropriate regulatory agency against certain institution affiliated parties primarily including management  employees and agents of a financial institution  as well as independent contractors such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution s affairs and who caused or are likely to cause more than minimum financial loss to or a significant adverse affect on the institution  who knowingly or recklessly violate a law or regulation  breach a fiduciary duty or engage in unsafe or unsound practices 
these practices can include the failure of an institution to timely file required reports or the submission of inaccurate reports 
these laws authorize the appropriate banking agency to issue cease and desist orders that may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnification or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets or take other action as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate 
governmental monetary policies 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  control of borrowings  open market operations  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks  deposits and assets of foreign branches  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
those monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans  investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company  therefore  cannot be predicted accurately 
annual audits 
every bank with total assets in excess of million  such as the bank  must have an annual independent audit made of the bank s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the fdic 
all of the above laws and regulations add to the cost of the company s operations and thus have a negative impact on profitability 
it should be noted that there has been a tremendous expansion experienced in recent years by financial service providers that are not subject to the same rules and regulations as are applicable to southside delaware and the company 
the company s management and the bank s management cannot predict what other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations might be adopted and the effects thereof on the company and the bank 
usury laws texas usury laws limit the rate of interest that may be charged by state banks 
certain federal laws provide a limited preemption of texas usury laws 
the maximum rate of interest that the bank may charge on direct business loans under texas law varies between per annum and i per annum for business and agricultural loans above  or ii per annum for other direct loans 
texas floating usury ceilings are tied to the week united states treasury bill auction rate 
other ceilings apply to open end credit card loans and dealer paper purchased by the company 
a federal statute removes interest ceilings under usury laws for loans by the company that are secured by first liens on residential real property 
economic environment the monetary policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve  have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the federal reserve regulates the national supply of bank credit 
among the means available to the federal reserve are open market operations in united states government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  changes in reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits  and loans and limitations on interest rates which member banks may pay on time or demand deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits

item a 
risk factors an investment in the company s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the company s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the company are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the company s business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of the company s common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to the company s business the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned net interest income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the company s management of interest rate risk 
the company s interest rate risk  liquidity  market value of securities and profitability are subject to risks associated with the performance of the leverage program 
the company implemented a leverage strategy in for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of the company s capital 
risks to our leverage strategy include reduced net interest margin and spread  adverse market value changes to the investment  mortgage backed and marketable equity securities  incorrect modeling results due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles  and the slope of the interest rate yield curve 
another risk could include the company s inability to obtain wholesale funding to profitably and properly fund the leverage program 
if the company s leverage strategy is flawed or poorly implemented  we may incur significant losses 
the company has a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
in addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case  often loans are secured with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the real estate in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in the company s primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of collateral and ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that  in a decreasing real estate market  the company would be required to increase its allowance for loan losses 
if the company is required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase its allowance for loan losses  the company s profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
the company has a high concentration of loans directly related to the medical community in its market area  primarily in smith and gregg counties 
a negative change adversely impacting the medical community  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is dependent on the medical community 
the primary source of repayment for loans in the medical community is cashflow from continuing operations 
we believe that risk in the medical community is mitigated because it is spread among multiple practice types and multiple specialties 
however  changes in the amount the government pays the medical community through the various government health insurance programs could adversely impact the medical community which in turn could result in higher default rates by borrowers in the medical industry 
furthermore  it is likely that  should there be any significant adverse impact to the medical community  the company s profitability and financial condition could also be adversely impacted 
the company s allowance for probable loan losses may be insufficient 
the company maintains an allowance for probable loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the company s control  may require an increase in the allowance for probable loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for probable loan losses  the company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for probable loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for probable loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned allowance for loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the company s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses 
the company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the company may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the company s ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the company s exposure to environmental liability 
although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which the company operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the texas areas of tyler  longview  lindale  whitehouse  gresham  athens  palestine  jacksonville  forney  seven points and gun barrel city 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the company s products and services as well as the ability of the company s customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the company s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area 
the company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets the company operates 
additionally  various out of state banks have begun to enter or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which the company currently operates 
the company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of the company s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the company can 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the company s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which the company introduces new products and services relative to its competitors 
customer satisfaction with the company s level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the company s competitive position  which could adversely affect the company s growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
the company  primarily through southside bank and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the company to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products the company may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
