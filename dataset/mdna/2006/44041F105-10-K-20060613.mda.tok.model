item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the corporation and the bank 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item of this form k 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis at financial condition and results of operations and this form k contain certain forward looking statements which are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the corporation 
management desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing the corporation of the protections of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statement in this form k 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the word believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar words 
the corporation s ability to predict results of the actual effect of future plans or strategies is uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s operations include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the corporation s market areas and accounting principles and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and you should not rely too much on these statements 
general the corporation s results of operations depend primarily on revenue generated as a result of its net interest income and non interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the corporation earns on its interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and investment securities and the interest the corporation pays on its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of customer savings and money market accounts  time deposits and borrowings 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit and loan accounts  gains on the sale of loans and investments  and loan servicing fees 
the corporation s results of operations are also affected by the provisions for loan losses and other expenses 
other expenses consist primarily of noninterest expense  including compensation and benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing  marketing  automated teller machine costs and  when applicable  deposit insurance premiums 
the corporation s results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy the bank s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank  dedicated to commercial lending  home mortgage lending  consumer lending  small business lending and providing quality financial services to local personal and business customers 
the bank has sought to implement this strategy by i focusing on commercial banking opportunities  ii continued efforts towards the origination of residential mortgage loans  including one to four family residential construction loans  iii providing high quality  personalized financial services to individuals and business customers and communities served by its branch network  iv selling many of its fixed rate mortgages to the secondary market  v focusing on asset quality  vi containing operating expenses  and vii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements combined with prudent growth 
operating strategy the corporation does not presently engage in any activities outside of serving as a shell parent company for the bank 
the operating strategy of the corporation has been to expand and diversify its consolidated operations across a variety of companies and or operating units that are engaged in complementary  but different  businesses and or operating strategies 
this diversification strategy is expected to continue as opportunities arise  although there are no specific acquisitions or new business formations planned at this time 
the bank currently has only one office in pierce county south of king county  with the remaining offices all located north of king county 
management hopes to provide additional support to its lakewood office in pierce county at some point in the future  however  no additional offices are planned at this time 
management has further indicated that the market areas just outside of king county including  but not necessarily limited to snohomish  pierce  kitsap and thurston counties are logical areas for potential future expansion  as these markets have characteristics most similar to those in which the bank has experienced previous success 
the primary business of the bank is to acquire funds in the form of deposits and wholesale funds  and to use the funds to make commercial  consumer  and real estate loans in its primary market area 
in addition  and to a lesser extent  the bank invests in a variety of investment grade securities including  but not necessarily limited to us government and federal agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt  equity securities  and municipal securities 
the bank intends to continue to fund its assets primarily with retail and commercial deposits  although fhlb advances  brokered deposits  and other wholesale borrowings  will also likely be used as a supplemental source of funds 
the corporation s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on the bank s loan and investment portfolio and the bank s cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the bank reviewed its opportunities with respect to both assets and liabilities 
in the past two fiscal years  for example  the bank chose to concentrate its commercial lending efforts on increasing its prime based loan portfolio  at a time when many lenders were offering fixed rate real estate loans at sub prime rates 
in this regard  the bank s loan portfolio growth was heavily concentrated in the active real estate development markets in the puget sound region 
through its excellent relationships with established real estate developers  the bank s experienced loan officers were successful at increasing this portion of the bank s portfolio  which is primarily prime based business 
this has been beneficial in the past year  with the federal reserve s open market committee s fomc efforts to increase short terms interest rates  which have in turn increased the prime lending rate on a regular basis 
the results of this strategy are discussed in more detail in the section entitled comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  net interest income 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the impact of these increasing rates has also impacted the bank s earnings  however at a more moderate level to date 
management acknowledges that there is a lag effect in this regard  as the rates on the bank s certificates of deposit liabilities do not adjust instantly  rather the impact occurs more gradually as the certificates of deposit mature and reprice in this higher rate environment 
these increases in liability expenses will continue even after the fomc stops its current tightening cycle  as long as the rates being offered for new certificates of deposit are higher than those maturing as is the case currently 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the corporation s profitability is also affected by the level of the bank s other income and expenses 
other noninterest income includes income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  loan servicing fees  deposit account related fees  and net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets 
this portion of the bank s income is heavily dependent on the bank s success at originating and selling one to four family mortgage loans into the secondary market 
in addition  the bank s ability to generate fee income on its deposit accounts impacts this portion of the bank s income stream 
in fiscal  the bank introduced an overdraft protection service  which enhanced the deposit related fee income and is discussed in more detail in the section entitled comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march  other noninterest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
in fiscal  the bank s efficiency ratio was adversely impacted by a conversion of the bank s core data processor 
however  management believes that the conversion will assist in achieving improving efficiencies  as the new core system contains improvements that will allow the bank to grow more efficiently 
in fiscal  the bank began a bank wide efficiency initiative  soliciting input from all employees and implementing many of the suggestions made during the project 
this will be an ongoing process  as management continues to look for ways to improve efficiency 
to encourage employees to participate in this initiative  the bank has added a profitability component to the incentive portion of employee s pay  and an efficiency counts for one third of this profitability component 
also during fiscal  the bank formed a core data processor task team  to analyze ways to best utilize its new data processing system 
at the time of the conversion in november  the focus was on converting the data from the previous system 
subsequently  the focus shifted to ensuring that the bank was taking advantage of the benefits offered by the new system  and is a process that will continue in future years 
finally  the corporation s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation  regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
critical accounting estimate management recognizes that loan losses occur over the life of a loan  and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based on a number of factors  including the level of non performing loans  loan loss experience  credit concentrations  a review of the quality of the loan portfolio  collateral values  historical industry loss experience  and uncertainties in economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because i it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future losses on loans  and ii the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
the corporation has active ongoing credit review function 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated  probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  historical industry loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time financial statements are prepared  but the ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the bank s control  which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided for in the financial statements 
the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank has established a systematic methodology to ensure that the allowance is adequate  and continues to work on enhancing its methodologies in this regard 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  each individual loan  previously classified by management  or newly classified during the quarterly review  is evaluated for loss potential  and a specific amount or percentage deemed to be at risk is added to the overall required reserve amount 
for the remaining portion of the portfolio the bank applies sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
a reserve factor is applied to homogeneous loan pools that is consistent with the bank s experience in that loan pool type or with industry guidelines if management believes such guidelines are more appropriate 
the applied percentage is also influenced by other economic factors in the bank s market area  the state s economy  and national economic factors that could influence the quality of the loan portfolio in general 
the calculated amount is compared to the actual amount recorded in the allowance at the end of each quarter and a determination is made as to whether the allowance is adequate 
management increases the amount of the allowance for loan losses by charges to income and decreases the amount by loans charged off net of recoveries 
the corporation s senior management reviews and analyzes the loan portfolio  charge offs  and allowance on a quarterly basis 
management then discusses the development and calculation of this critical accounting estimate with the executive committee of the board of directors 
horizon s audit committee also reviews the corporation s disclosures including this critical accounting estimate 
management reviewed and evaluated the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance at march  and believes that the allowance at of net loans  or million is adequate yet not excessive for the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and the current economic environment 
the allowance was of net loans or million at march  in fiscal  the loan portfolio grew to million at march  from million at march  the loan portfolio has experienced substantial growth especially in construction and land development loans 
at march   construction and land development loans totaled million  an increase of million from million at march  the increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to the substantial growth in this higher risk portion of the loan portfolio 
in addition  while fiscal was a period that showed continued improvement in the economic environment in the bank s markets  these markets also experienced significant housing price increases  well in excess of wage growth 
these factors  coupled with the increasing energy costs  increasing commodity prices  and the lagging effects of the federal reserve s tightening cycle  led management to increase the allowance to its current levels 
the bank recorded net charge offs of     and  during the years ended march     and  respectively 
consumer loans including home equity totaled million or of the net loan portfolio at march  visa card loans and unsecured consumer loans accounted for all of the bank s charge offs 
the provision for loan losses has fluctuated depending on the growth and mix of the loan portfolio and the level of charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million  million  million  million and million for the fiscal years ended     and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the corporation s significant accounting principles are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment than do our other significant accounting policies detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation reviews historical origination and charge off relationships  charge off experience factors  collection data  delinquency reports  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions and trends and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the appropriateness of the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the corporation repossesses and disposes of the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate yet not excessive to cover probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates 
investments 
the corporation classifies its investments as either available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair value  which is determined by obtaining quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income and excluded from earnings 
realized gains and losses and declines in fair value determined to be other than temporary are included in earnings 
the fair value of investments is discussed in more detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
long lived assets and intangibles 
the corporation periodically assesses the impairment of its long lived assets and intangibles using judgment as to the effects of external factors  including market conditions 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from the corporation s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate market value 
accrued taxes 
the corporation estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the corporation s tax position 
comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total consolidated assets for the corporation as of march   were billion  an increase from the march  level of million 
this increase in assets was primarily attributable to the growth in loans receivable to million at march  from million at march  this loan growth was primarily attributable to the increase in commercial loans during this period  as the bank continued its practice of selling most of its single family fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
the bank sold million of real estate loans in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the bank sells real estate loans during periods of increased loan volume to improve cash flow and to manage its interest rate risk profile 
the following is an analysis of the loan portfolio by major type of loan at march  and at march  dollars in thousands first mortgage loans one to four family   one to four family construction   participations sold   subtotal   construction and land development   residential commercial real estate   nonresidential commercial real estate   commercial loans   home equity secured   other consumer loans   subtotal   subtotal   less allowance for loan losses   total loans receivable   net residential loans   net commercial loans   net commercial real estate loans   net consumer loans   also contributing to the change in assets was the decline in investment and mortgage backed securities  available for sale  which  combined  decreased to million at march  from million at march  as management allowed these funds to shift to loans receivable during the year 
the tables below display the characteristics of the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios at march  at march  amortized gain estimated cost loss fair value in thousands available for sale securities state and political subdivisions and us government agency us   marketable equity securities    mutual funds   corporate debt securities   mortgage backed securities and cmos   total available for sale securities    held to maturity securities state and political subdivisions and us government agency us mortgage backed securities and cmos total held to maturity securities total securities    maturity schedule of securities at march  available for sale held to maturity amortized estimated amortized estimated cost fair value cost fair value in thousands maturities less than one year   over one year to five years   over five to ten years   over ten years   mutual funds and marketable equity securities   total investment securities 
  total liabilities also increased to billion at march   from million at march  this increase was the result  in large part  of growth in deposits  which increased to million at march  from million at march  the following is an analysis of the deposit portfolio by major type of deposit at march  and at march  in thousands demand deposits savings   checking   checking noninterest bearing   money market   time certificates of deposit less than    greater than or equal to    total deposits   also contributing to the growth was an increase in other borrowed funds to million at march   from million at march  during the year  the bank borrowed an additional million from the fhlb to help manage interest rate risk and support the growth in assets 
also included in the march  balance sheet is an investment in real estate for a joint venture and the corresponding borrowing 
during the year ended march   the bank s subsidiary westward financial services  as a partner in the greenbriar nw llp  purchased an acre parcel of land in bellingham  washington for future development 
the partnership intends to develop the property in future years  into a neighborhood community to be known as fairhaven highlands 
the million shown on the corporation s balance sheet as an asset at march  represents the current level of the investment in real estate joint ventures  including the fairhaven highlands joint venture 
at march   the million total investment in joint ventures included a remaining portion of a residential development joint venture that has since been completed and closed 
the million shown in the liability section of the balance sheet represents the corresponding wholesale borrowing used to fund the investment in the fairhaven highlands joint venture  which includes costs that have been incurred and capitalized since the acquisition of the property 
at this time  the partnership is in the process of meeting with the appropriate public and private entities  in its preliminary planning efforts relating to the future development of the property 
stockholders equity at march  increased to million from million at march  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net income to million at march  from million at march  this change includes the effects from the corporation s share repurchase program  with repurchases totaling million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the corporation remains strong in terms of its capital position  with a stockholder equity to assets ratio of at march   compared to at march  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march net interest income 
net interest income in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal total interest income increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest income on loans in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was as a result of a combination of factors  including the growth in loans receivable  as the bank experienced significant loan growth during the year  increasing to million at march   compared to million at march   and an increasing prime lending rate throughout the fiscal year 
with a portfolio of prime based loans in excess of million throughout the year million at march  each quarter point increase in the prime lending rate equated to an annualized increase in interest income on those types of loans of over million 
the prime lending rate increased to at march   compared to at march  also included in interest income for the year ended march   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred fee income recognition 
in fiscal and  most of these fees were related to the bank s commercial loan portfolio  that resulted in large part to the success in increasing the real estate development loan portfolio 
these development loans typically are shorter term in nature  so the deferred fee recognition during the life of the loan is greater than what would be recognized for a comparable loan fee on a longer amortizing loan 
the table below presents an analysis of deferred fee recognition for the past two fiscal years year ended march  in thousands commercial loan deferred fees   one to four real estate mortgage loan deferred fees total   interest and dividends on investments and mortgage backed securities was million in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to lower levels of investments and mortgage backed securities outstanding during the respective periods  as average total investments decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  the decline in the investment portfolio balances in these years was primarily attributable to the funding of the bank s lending activities 
to enhance the bank s profitability  management chose to direct its available funds to fund loans receivable  in lieu of purchasing securities for its investment portfolio 
also contributing to the decline in fiscal was a reduction in dividend income on the bank s fhlb stock 
at march   horizon bank held million in fhlb of seattle stock and received dividends in the amounts of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the fhlb of seattle announced that  despite the dividend paid to shareholders on march   it had indefinitely suspended the payment of dividends 
the fhlb of seattle is operating under a regulatory directive and in april announced that all future dividends would be suspended until its financial position and performance improves 
on may   the fhlb of seattle announced a three year dividend suspension  therefore  the bank s investment income will be reduced accordingly over this time period 
stock ownership in the fhlb of seattle is expected to remain stable  increasing only if necessary to support the bank s borrowing needs 
the fhlb of seattle recently revised its stock requirement related to borrowings outstanding  therefore the bank s existing level of fhlb stock will support a higher level of wholesale borrowings  decreasing the likelihood that the bank will need to purchase additional stock to support its borrowing activities 
total interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal interest on deposits increased significantly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as discussed in the paragraphs above  the increasing level of interest rates during the year resulted in an increase in interest income  however  it also caused an increase in interest expense  including interest paid on the bank s deposits 
at march   approximately of the bank s deposits were in the form of certificates of deposit  including million in brokered certificates of deposit 
as such  an increasing interest rate environment affects the bank s deposit interest expense more dramatically than if a larger portion of the bank s funding were in the form of lower cost checking and liquid savings accounts 
while management continues its efforts to decrease its reliance on certificates of deposit as a funding source  the competitive marketplace for core deposit dollars has resulted in only moderate success in this regard 
during fiscal  the bank s increase in deposit interest expense lagged the increase in its interest income on loans in dollar terms 
this was the result  in large part  to the immediate impact to interest income from the bank s prime based loan portfolio with each increase in the prime lending rate  and the lagged effect of increased interest expense on certificates of deposit  since these certificate of deposit rate increases do not occur instantaneously  instead lagging until the maturity of the certificate of deposit 
in addition  even if interest rates were not increasing  the bank s interest on deposits would continue to increase  as long as the prevailing market rates to attract deposits are higher than the rates being paid on its renewing deposits 
interest on borrowings increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of a higher level of borrowings outstanding during the year ended march  of million compared to million during the year ended march  along with the increasing interest rate environment in fiscal the significant increase in fiscal was related to funding the bank s significant loan growth during the year 
the vast majority of this borrowing growth was in short term borrowings  consistent with the shorter term  prime based loan growth the bank experienced during the year 
the bank continues to utilize wholesale borrowings in order to further leverage its balance sheet and better manage its interest rate risk profile 
provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual historical industry loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of period    provision for loan losses    charge offs  net of recoveries allowance at end of period    allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans receivable at the end of the period net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding during the period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming assets at the end of period the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  this change resulted from management s ongoing analysis of changes in loan portfolio composition by collateral categories  overall credit quality of the portfolio  peer group analysis  and current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of net loans receivable at march  compared to million  or of net loans receivable at march  the increased allowance level resulted from continued loan portfolio growth in the higher risk lending categories of construction and land development  commercial real estate and commercial business loans during the period  which comprised million  or of total loans receivable at march   versus million  or at march  in addition  commercial and multi family loans have larger individual loan amounts  which have a greater single impact on the total portfolio quality in the event of delinquency or default 
the corporation considers the allowance level to be appropriate  as a result of the changing portfolio mix and the current economic environment 
as of march   there were no loans in the loan portfolio over days delinquent and nine loans on non accrual status 
the bank had no real estate owned at march  total non performing assets were million  or of total assets at march  compared to million  or of total assets at march  at march  dollars in thousands non performing assets accruing loans days past due non accrual loans   restructured loans total non performing loans   total non performing loans net loans real estate owned total non performing assets   total non performing assets total assets noninterest income 
noninterest income in fiscal decreased slightly to million  from million in fiscal service fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was the implementation of our overdraft protection service during july  which  together with the increase in deposits  resulted in increased fee income 
there was a net loss on sales of investment securities of  in fiscal compared to a net gain of  in fiscal the losses in fiscal were a result of the restructuring of approximately million of lower yielding securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal the proceeds from these sales have since been reinvested in highly rated  higher yielding investments 
the securities sold were yielding approximately basis lower than the securities purchased  therefore the effect of this restructuring is expected to increase interest income from these securities by over  in fiscal other noninterest income was essentially unchanged at million for the periods ending march  and included in these numbers was the recognition of approximately  and  respectively  in profits on the real estate development project from a joint venture of the bank s wholly owned subsidiary  westward financial corp 
as of march  all lot sales have been concluded for this project 
as a result of the current status of the development of these lots  no sales activity is currently anticipated for fiscal from the bank s real estate joint venture activities 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal increased to million  a increase from million in fiscal compensation and employee benefits increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal building occupancy expense was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal increases in compensation and employee benefits and building and occupancy expenses resulted from the full year operating expenses for two full service retail offices in marysville and lakewood 
other noninterest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to the bank s charter conversion and increased businees occupation tax attributable to the shifting loan portfolio from non taxable mortgage loans to taxable commercial loans 
data processing expenses decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal expenses for the year ended march  included one time conversion related costs related to the bank s core processor conversion completed in november advertising and marketing expenses increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due in part to increased advertising expenses to support the bank s new marysville and lakewood offices 
the decreases in fiscal were primarily attributable to management s decision to reduce this expense 
the increases in fiscal and were related to market research and brand positioning of the bank in its various markets 
net income 
net income of million for fiscal represents a increase from net income of million for fiscal basic earnings per share for was on weighted average shares outstanding of  compared to basic earnings per share of on weighted average shares of  in fiscal comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march net interest income 
net interest income in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal total interest income increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest income on loans in fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to the growth in loans receivable  as the bank experienced significant loan growth during the year  increasing to million at march   compared to million at march  included in these amounts for  and were approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred fee income recognition 
fiscal was a year which included a significant number of one to four family loan refinances  which significantly impacted the deferred fee recognition in that year 
the table below shows the breakdown of deferred fee recognition for the past two fiscal years year ended march  in thousands commercial loan deferred fees   one to four real estate mortgage loan deferred fees  total   interest and dividends on investments and mortgage backed securities was million in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal this decrease was a result of a lower level of investments and mortgage backed securities outstanding during the year  as total investments decreased to million at march  as compared to million at march  the decline in the investment portfolio balance was primarily attributable to the funding of the bank s lending activities 
also contributing to the decline in fiscal was a reduction in dividend income on the bank s fhlb stock 
at march   horizon held million in fhlb of seattle stock and received dividends in the amounts of  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal on may   the fhlb of seattle announced a three year dividend suspension  therefore  the bank s investment income will be reduced accordingly over this time period 
total interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal interest on deposits was essentially unchanged at million in fiscal and this occurred despite increased deposits outstanding as a result of the overall decline in interest rates 
interest on borrowings increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to a higher level of borrowings outstanding of million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the increase in fiscal was related to funding the bank s significant loan growth during the year 
during the year ended march   the bank continued to utilize wholesale borrowings in order to further leverage its balance sheet and better manage its interest rate risk profile 
provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  this change resulted from management s ongoing analysis of changes in loan portfolio composition by collateral categories  overall credit quality of the portfolio  historical industry analysis  and current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of net loans receivable at march   compared to million  or of net loans receivable at march  the increased allowance level resulted from continued loan portfolio growth in the higher risk lending categories of commercial and multi family construction permanent loans and commercial business loans during the period  which comprised million  or of net loans receivable at march   versus million  or at march  as of march   there were no loans in the loan portfolio over days delinquent and loans on non accrual status

noninterest income in fiscal was million  a decrease of from million in fiscal contributing to the decrease in fiscal was the decrease in the net gain on the sale of loans servicing released of to  from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decline was attributable to a lower amount of loans sold in the current year of million versus million in fiscal  which had a much more active residential refinance market than fiscal this decrease was offset by the increase in service fees of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary reasons for this increase was the growth in deposits which increased deposit related fees and revisions to the bank s fee schedules during the year 
the net gain on sales of investment securities decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the gains in these periods were primarily attributable to management s decisions in these years to sell selected securities from the bank s investment portfolio 
other non interest income decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal increased to million  a increase from fiscal of million 
compensation and employee benefits increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the overall growth in employment at the bank  including key additions to staff as the bank continued its efforts to enhance its commercial banking expertise  along with staffing expenses for the bank s lynnwood office in fiscal  and the marysville and lakewood offices in fiscal building occupancy expense was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to the opening of a full service retail office in marysville  washington 
other noninterest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily a result of increased expenses related to accounting and auditing services for compliance with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  and expenses related to opening the marysville office in november data processing expenses increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the primary reason for this increase relates to the core data processor conversion effective november  this core data processor conversion will allow the bank to better serve its growing commercial customer base  compared to its previous data processor which targeted traditional thrift institutions 
the other significant contributing factor to this difference relates to an abnormally low level of expenses in fiscal  as a result of a renegotiation of the bank s contract with it core data processor at the time  which included substantial concessions in the first quarter of fiscal  and a reduced monthly expense thereafter

the corporation foresees no factors that would impair its ability to hold debt securities to maturity 
as indicated on the corporation s consolidated statement of cash flows contained in item of this form k  the corporation s primary sources of funds are cash flow from operations  which consist primarily of mortgage loan repayments  deposit increases  loan sales  borrowings  and cash received from the maturity or sale of investment securities 
the corporation s liquidity fluctuates with the supply of funds and management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate at this time 
if additional liquidity is needed  the corporation s options include  but are not necessarily limited to i selling additional loans in the secondary market  ii entering into reverse repurchase agreements  iii borrowing from the fhlb of seattle  iv accepting additional jumbo  brokered  and or public funds deposits  or v accessing the discount window of the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
stockholders equity as of march  was million  or of assets  compared to million  or of assets at march  the bank continues to exceed the minimum tier one capital required by the fdic in order to be considered well capitalized 
the bank s total risk adjusted capital ratio as of march  was  compared to as of march  these figures remain well above the well capitalized minimum of set by the fdic 
the corporation has conducted various buy back programs since august in march  the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan that runs concurrent with the fiscal year  allowing the corporation to repurchase up to of total shares outstanding  or approximately  shares 
this marked the corporation s seventh stock repurchase plan 
in fiscal  under the previous plans  the corporation repurchased  shares at an average price of 
for additional information concerning the corporation s repurchase activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  see item of this form k 
management intends to continue its stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock is perceived to contribute to the overall growth of stockholder value 
the number of shares of stock to be repurchased and the price to be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the corporation 
the primary factors  however  are market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market  the number of shares available in the market  the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment  the ability to increase the value and or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares  the corporation s liquidity and capital needs  and regulatory requirements 
presently  it is management s belief that purchases made under the current board approved plan will not materially affect the corporation s capital or liquidity position 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation continues to be exposed to interest rate risk  although at reduced levels compared to prior years 
currently  the corporation s assets and liabilities are not materially exposed to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
at march   the corporation had no off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  nor did it have a trading portfolio of investments 
in fiscal and fiscal  the corporation continued to outsource its interest rate risk modeling to a third party provider that utilizes an ips sendero model 
this model analyzes the corporation s major balance sheet components  and attempts to estimate the changes to the corporation s income statement and economic value of equity  under a variety of interest rate change scenarios 
the figures contained in the table presented below  in the quantitative disclosures about market risk section  were derived from this model 
while numerous assumptions go into this modeling  and undue reliance should not be placed on the specific results  management believes that this improved modeling will enhance its interest rate risk management efforts 
similar to the analysis performed one year ago  the current interest rate risk modeling continues to show the bank s balance sheet as moderately asset sensitive over a month time period 
the bank s continued focus on shorter term  variable rate assets has contributed to the bank s performance in this regard 
this strategy has allowed the bank to utilize wholesale borrowing and brokered deposits as a supplemental source of funds to its retail and commercial deposit gathering efforts  without significantly impacting the bank s interest rate risk profile 
in addition  the bank has been successful at increasing its demand deposit base in recent years  further enhancing the bank s interest rate risk profile 
accordingly  the interest rate risk modeling performed each quarter during fiscal shows that the bank continues to operate within the interest rate risk tolerance limits set by its board of directors 
with the current level of interest rates at march  and the associated prepayment assumptions in the low rate environment  interest rate risk modeling predicts moderate improvement in the bank s performance in a moderately higher rate environment over a month time period 
however  as interest rates increase  prepayment assumptions can change significantly  therefore it would be inappropriate to assume that significantly higher rates would have a sustained positive effect on the bank s and the corporation s performance 
further  an increase in rates  without a corresponding increase in certain indices such as prime  would adversely affect the corporation s performance 
for example  if it becomes necessary for the corporation to increase the rates it pays to attract funds in a rising rate environment as is the case currently  an absence of a corresponding increase in the prime lending rate would  of course  negatively affect performance 
in addition  depending on timing differences  the magnitude of various rates change in future periods  and the composition of the corporation s balance sheet  future modeling efforts may show the corporation s returning to a liability sensitive position 
management continues to monitor these areas  in its ongoing effort to manage the corporation s interest rate risk 
effects of interest rate floors periodically  the corporation is able to establish interest rate floors on certain loans  in order to enhance profitability 
at march   the corporation had million in commercial loans tied to the prime lending rate 
of these prime based loans  approximately will increase accordingly when prime increases as the current rates are above any floors in place 
while these floors provide an overall better return for the corporation  the information provided in this section is intended to provide additional information regarding the degree to which the corporation s earnings may be affected with future changes in the prime lending rate 
we continue to monitor these measures  as these floors may provide a benefit to the bank in the future  when the prime rate declines from current levels 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the corporation enters into contractual obligations that meet various business needs 
these contractual obligations include time deposits to customers  borrowings from the fhlb of seattle and lease obligations for facilities 
see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information 
the following table summarizes the corporation s long term contractual obligations at march  less than one to three to one three five year years years thereafter total in thousands time deposits      long term borrowings     operating lease obligations total      off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the corporation makes off balance sheet arrangements  including credit commitments to its customers to meet their financial needs 
these arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the bank makes personal  commercial  and real estate lines of credit available to customers as well as stand by letters of credit or financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit to customers are subject to the bank s normal credit policies and are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of noninterest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
our management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation

the table below represents the balances of the bank s financial instruments at march  the expected maturity categories take into consideration projected prepayment rates as well as actual amortization of principal 
in preparation of the table  numerous assumptions were made regarding prepayment rates and deposit account interest sensitivity

as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  in the event of changes in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and withdrawals from savings accounts might deviate significantly from those assumed in presenting the table 
therefore  the data presented in the table should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results
