item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic changes and various other factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
as a general rule  economic factors that affect seniors will have a corresponding impact on the senior living industry 
for example  the continuing strength of the home resale market in most areas of the country has been beneficial to seniors  since the equity from the sale of a home is a significant source of funding for senior living care for many people 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of this decade 
we believe that the supply and demand for these types of facilities is today nationwide about balanced 
we believe that the aging of the us population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private pay resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated for the foreseeable future 
however  it appears to us that today some investors may be assuming that the improvements in financial results realized at these types of communities during the past few years may continue indefinitely 
the reported sales price being paid today for some independent and assisted living communities seem to exceed replacement cost  including fill up losses 
we are concerned that new development activity may occur in the near future  and it is currently unclear whether this activity will result in excess or moderate new supply which can be absorbed without adversely affecting existing market conditions 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in s caused occupancy at many nursing homes to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new nursing homes by most states  has caused nursing care to be delivered in many older facilities 
we believe that many nursing homes currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that eventually political pressures from an aging population will cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 
we have made special efforts at our nursing homes to maintain the physical plants so that we can continue to compete 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institution pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
we believe that the medicare d benefits program which became effective january  will increase the demand for pharmacy drugs and services and that cost containment pressures  which inevitably will be part of this government funded program  will increase business for efficient institutional pharmacy businesses such as those we have recently begun to operate 
we earn our revenues primarily by providing housing and services to our residents 
during  approximately of our net revenues from residents came from medicare and medicaid and of our net revenues from residents came from private pay and other resources 
all private pay residents are billed in advance for the next month s housing and care 
our most significant expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs 
rent expense we lease of our senior living communities from senior housing and four from hcpi 
management fee to sls fees for the communities sls manages for us prior to november  
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment 
interest expense includes interest on outstanding debt balances and amortization of deferred financing costs

of living units end of period occupancy average daily rate percent of net revenues from residents from medicare percent of net revenues from residents from medicaid percent of net revenues from residents from private and other sources the increase in net revenues from residents is due primarily to revenues from the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june  higher per diem charges to residents and a increase in occupancy 
the increase in net revenues from residents at the communities that we have operated continuously since january  is due primarily to higher per diem charges to residents 
the increase in revenues from our pharmacies is a result of our acquiring one pharmacy in september and another pharmacy in june our increase in wages and benefits costs is primarily due to wages and benefits at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june and wage increases 
the increase in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs  primarily results from the other operating expenses at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june and increased charges from third parties 
this increase is also the result of approximately million of additional insurance costs related to the communities managed for us by sls in the community expenses for the communities that we have operated continuously since january  have increased by principally due to wage and benefit increases  as well as approximately million of additional insurance costs related to the communities managed for us by sls in the increase in pharmacy expenses is a result of our acquiring one pharmacy in september and another pharmacy in june management fees related to the communities that sls managed for us increased by because of increased revenues at these communities and a contractual increase in the formula for calculating the management fee 
the rent expense increase is due to the addition of communities that we began to lease in and  and our payment of additional rent for capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  the termination expense for certain sls management agreements arose from our termination of management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls managed for us 
in august  we notified sls of the termination of management agreements for senior living communities  and  in november  we terminated these sls management agreements for a payment of million 
in february  we terminated the management agreement for one additional community for a payment of million 
we sent a termination notice to sls for this community in december  and therefore accounted for this termination in we will no longer pay management fees for these communities to sls  and we are directly operating these communities 
sls continues to manage communities for us 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  primarily results from our increased operations at the communities we acquired in november  the six communities we acquired in june  integration costs associated with our acquisition of those communities and increased audit and professional services fees for compliance with sarbanes oxley 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the communities we acquired in connection with the lta acquisition in november and the six communities we acquired in june and to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our communities managed by sls 
to partially fund our termination fee for the management agreements with sls on november   we sold the six gordon communities that we acquired in june to senior housing for net proceeds of million and senior housing leased these communities back to us 
in connection with this sale of these communities to senior housing  we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these communities to the amount realized upon their sale to senior housing 
the purchase price paid to us by senior housing is the same amount as the purchase price we paid to the seller of the gordon communities 
the impairment loss which we recognized relates principally to transaction costs which we previously capitalized 
our interest and other income decreased primarily because of lower levels of investable cash 
our interest expense increased by million  primarily due to the mortgages we assumed in connection with the lta acquisition and mortgages assumed in connection with our acquisition of the six gordon communities in june the provision for income taxes decreased because we do not anticipate owing tax under the alternative minimum tax regime in we accrued  of federal alternative minimum income tax expense during the year ended december  loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  these losses in both years are primarily the result of our ceasing operations at two communities in and three communities in year ended december  versus year ended december  the following tables present an overview of our portfolio for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per day amounts variance change net revenues from residents pharmacy revenue wages and benefits other operating expenses pharmacy expenses management fee to sls rent expense general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest and other income interest expense provision for income taxes loss from discontinued operations net income loss no

the increase in revenues from our two pharmacies is a result of our acquiring these pharmacies during the third quarters of and our increase in wages and benefits costs is primarily due to wage increases as well as wages related to the three communities we began to operate in may  one community we began to operate in may and the communities we acquired in november the increase in other operating expenses  which include utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  insurance and community level administrative costs is primarily a result of increased charges from third parties  our operation of three additional communities beginning in may  one community we began to operate in may  and our communities acquired in november the operating expenses for the communities that we have operated continuously since january  have increased by principally due to wage and benefit increases 
the increase in pharmacy expenses is a result of our acquiring these pharmacies during the third quarters of and management fees related to the communities that sls manages for us increased by because of the increased revenues at these communities and a contractual increase in the effective management fee calculation 
the rent expense increase is due to the addition of communities that we began to lease in and  and our payment of additional rent for capital improvements which were funded by senior housing since january  the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to costs resulting from our increased operations  as well as increases in wages and benefits for our corporate and regional staff 
the increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures related to the communities managed by sls and our acquisition of communities as a result of the lta acquisition in november  offset by our sale of seven communities in our interest and other income increased by million primarily due to the amounts received in connection with our january settlement with marriott and msls  whereby we and senior housing were each paid million 
under the terms of the settlement  we and senior housing  and marriott and msls  agreed to dismiss all claims and counterclaims asserted in the litigation 
we accrued  for federal alternative minimum income taxes during the year ended december  this provision was not required for the year ended december  there is no provision for regular income taxes because we have net operating loss carry forwards 
loss from discontinued operations for each of the years ended december  and was million 
these losses are primarily the result of our ceasing operations at three communities in and nine communities in liquidity and capital resources our current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable due to increased activity 
our current liabilities were million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in current liabilities is primarily the result of an increase in insurance reserves and the sls termination fee payable for the community we terminated in february current liabilities also increased from our expanded operations which resulted from the gordon acquisition in june reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the current year s presentation  including a reclassification of the refundable portion of resident admission fees at certain communities  which had been presented as a long term liability in  to a current liability  and a reclassification of the related restricted cash arising from such fees  which had been presented as a long term asset in  to a current asset 
we lease communities from senior housing under four leases 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay minimum rent of million annually and percentage rent for most communities beginning in we believe we are in compliance with the terms of our leases with senior housing 
upon our request  senior housing reimburses our capital expenditures made at the communities we lease from senior housing and increases our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
senior housing reimbursed us million during the year ended december  for capital expenditures made at these leased communities and increased our annual rent by approximately million 
our revenues from services to residents at our communities are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
at some of our communities  operating revenues for nursing home services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our nursing homes 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  and of our net revenues from residents were derived from these programs 
our medicare net revenues from residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in each of october and  our medicare rates increased by approximately over the prior period 
our increase in medicare revenues from to and from to resulted from this rate increase and an increase in the number of residents at our facilities who were eligible for medicare 
effective january   cms implemented changes to the payment categories it uses to set daily payment rates for medicare beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities 
these categories are known as resource utilization groups  or rugs 
cms has introduced nine new payment categories for medically complex patients  increasing the number of categories from to  and has made revisions to its payment rates for current rugs 
also effective january   these rug changes eliminated certain temporary additional payments for certain skilled nursing care and rehabilitation groups 
we are currently unable to predict the financial impact on our operations of these changes to medicare rates 
our medicaid net revenues from residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the bush administration and certain members of the senate and the house of representatives have recently proposed medicare and medicaid policy changes and rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or are expected to reduce medicaid funding 
the magnitude of the potential medicaid rate reductions and the impact of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses  as well as the magnitude of the potential medicaid policy changes  cannot currently be estimated  but they may be material to our operations  may affect our future results of operations and may produce losses 
we have recently agreed to lease two rehabilitation hospitals that we expect to begin operating in a significant amount of the revenues at these hospitals is paid by medicare 
when we begin to operate these hospitals  we will become more dependent upon the medicare programs 
also  the january  effective date for medicare drug benefits means that our pharmacy operations are becoming more dependent upon the medicare program 
recent increases in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  which is affecting the senior living industry  may continue to have an adverse impact upon our future results of operations 
although we self insure a portion of these costs  some of our insurance reserves may also increase 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to incur debt  as more fully described below in debt instruments and covenants 
the terms of our leases with senior housing contain provisions whereby senior housing may cancel our rights under these agreements upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change of control events 
these leases also limit our ability to create  incur  assume or guarantee indebtedness 
during  senior housing agreed to sell us two nursing homes in michigan that we leased from senior housing 
the purchase price was million  the appraised value of the properties 
in april  we purchased the first of these two properties from senior housing for million 
in may  we purchased the second property for million 
we financed these two acquisitions with proceeds we received from two new hud insured mortgages and by using cash on hand 
under the terms of our lease with senior housing  the annual rent payable under the lease was reduced by of the prices we paid to senior housing for the two nursing homes 
in november  we acquired of the capital stock of lta for approximately million  excluding closing costs 
lta owned  leased and operated senior living communities with  living units  which primarily offer assisted living services  located in seven states 
all of the revenues at these communities are paid by residents from their private resources 
we acquired lta because its business complemented our business strategy of focusing our operations in high quality senior living assets where residents pay for our services with private resources 
to finance this acquisition  we entered into a million sale leaseback transaction with senior housing for of the communities acquired from lta 
we also entered a million mortgage loan with senior housing secured by five of our properties 
we funded the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand and by assuming hud insured long term mortgage debt and an operating lease for four communities from hcpi 
in december and january  we issued a total of  common shares in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of the proceeds raised in this offering to pay off the million mortgage loan with senior housing described above  and we added the remainder to available cash balances 
in march  we acquired a unit assisted living community located in georgia for approximately million 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand 
in june  we acquired six assisted living communities from gordon for approximately million 
these communities have a combined licensed resident capacity of and are located in western pennsylvania 
we funded this purchase using million drawn under our revolving credit facility  the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction and a mortgage transaction with senior housing 
we sold four different assisted living communities to senior housing for million and senior housing leased these communities back to us for initial rent of million per annum 
senior housing also provided us with a million first mortgage line of credit secured by the six gordon communities 
we borrowed million under the first mortgage line of credit when we closed the gordon purchase and repaid it in august with proceeds raised from our sale of common shares 
the mortgage line of credit was terminated in connection with the sale and leaseback of the six gordon communities with senior housing on october  in august and september  we issued a total of  common shares in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds raised in this offering to pay off the million mortgage line of credit with senior housing described above and to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and we added the remainder to available cash balances 
we issued  and  common shares to our directors  officers and others who provide services to us in and  respectively 
in august  we sent notices to sls to terminate management agreements for of the senior living communities that sls managed for us 
in november  we terminated the sls management agreements for these communities for a fee of million and we began to directly operate these communities 
we no longer pay management fees for these communities to sls 
we funded this termination payment with cash on hand  including the proceeds of our sale of common shares in august and september  and with the proceeds of a sale leaseback transaction with senior housing for the six communities we acquired in june from gordon 
we sold the six gordon communities to senior housing for net proceeds of million and senior housing leased these communities back to us 
our initial rent to senior housing for these communities is million per annum 
the purchase price paid to us by senior housing is the same amount as the purchase price we paid to the seller of the gordon communities 
in december  we and sls agreed to terminate the management agreement for one additional community 
in february  we terminated this management agreement for a payment of million and we began to directly operate this community 
sls continues to manage communities for us 
we believe that a combination of our efforts to increase revenues and contain costs  our ability to borrow on our revolving credit facility  our ability to sell to senior housing certain capital improvements made to communities leased from senior housing and the possibility of sales or financings of our owned communities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  operating expenses  rent payments to senior housing  debt service and capital expenditures for the next months and the foreseeable future 
in december  senior housing sold two of our communities where we had ceased operations 
senior housing sold one community located in florida for net proceeds of approximately million  which caused a  reduction in annual minimum rent payable to senior housing in accordance with our lease terms 
senior housing sold the other community located in california for net proceeds of approximately million  which caused a  reduction in annual minimum rent payable to senior housing in accordance with our lease terms 
in february  as discussed above  we assumed the operations of a community from sls which is located in coral springs  florida 
we expect to undertake a significant capital improvement project at this community in and that may total approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of our lease with senior housing  senior housing will fund the cost of this capital improvement project and our annual rent payable to senior housing will increase pursuant to the formula set forth in the lease 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total debt obligations are the amounts due under several hud insured mortgages 
operating lease obligations are the minimum lease payments to senior housing and hcpi through and  the current lease terms 
they do not include percentage rent that may be payable under these leases 
other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap are primarily insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance 
this total excludes the security deposits we may owe to residents  which total million at december  debt instruments and covenants in may  we entered into a new revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on borrowings under this facility is libor plus a premium 
the maximum amount available under this facility is million  and is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
we are the borrower under the revolving credit facility and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the facility 
the facility is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries accounts receivable  deposit accounts and related assets 
the facility is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our properties and contains other customary provisions 
in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals  the maximum amounts which we may draw under this credit facility may be increased to million 
the termination date of the facility is may  the termination date may be extended twice  in each case by twelve months  subject to lender approval  our payment of extension fees and other conditions 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding and  as of march   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
as of march   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this revolving credit agreement 
at december   we have hud insured mortgage loans totaling million that are secured by nine properties 
the weighted average interest rate on these loans is 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly until maturities at varying dates ranging from february to june these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
at march   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these mortgages 
we recorded mortgage premiums in connection with some of these hud mortgages totaling million in order to record assumed mortgages at their estimated fair value 
the mortgage premiums are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense until the maturity of the mortgages 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  third party guarantees  or material joint ventures or partnerships 
related party transactions on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of its ownership of our shares to its shareholders 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing and others pursuant to which it was agreed  among other things  that so long as senior housing remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without the consent of senior housing  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will not permit nor take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing or hrpt properties trust another reit which owns shares of senior housing  or hrpt  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing or hrpt as reits  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events  as defined  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we maintain our shared services agreement with rmr we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing  hrpt or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invest 
at the time of our spin off from senior housing  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
our two managing directors  messrs 
martin and portnoy  are currently the managing trustees of senior housing 
of the senior living communities we operate  are leased from senior housing for total annual minimum rent of million 
since january   we have entered into several transactions with senior housing  including in may  we purchased a property that we had leased from senior housing for its appraised value of million 
this purchase was funded with proceeds we received from a hud insured mortgage and our cash on hand 
in june  we acquired six assisted living communities from gordon for approximately million 
we funded this purchase using million drawn under our revolving credit facility and the proceeds of a sale leaseback and mortgage transaction with senior housing 
we sold four of our assisted living communities to senior housing for million and senior housing leased these communities back to us for initial rent of million per annum 
senior housing also provided us with a million first mortgage line of credit secured by the six gordon communities 
we borrowed million under the first mortgage line of credit when we closed the gordon purchase  and repaid this amount in august with proceeds from our sale of common shares 
the mortgage line of credit was terminated in october in connection with our sale and leaseback with senior housing for the six gordon communities 
senior housing paid us approximately million for these six communities 
our initial rent to senior housing for these six communities is million per annum 
during  as permitted by our leases with senior housing  we sold to senior housing  at cost  approximately million of improvements made to properties leased from senior housing  and the annual rent payable to senior housing was increased by of the amount senior housing paid for the improvements  or approximately million 
in february  we agreed to lease two hospitals from senior housing 
the term of the lease for these two hospitals commences when we receive all health regulatory approvals required to operate the two hospitals 
these two hospitals provide health rehabilitation services and are located in braintree and woburn  massachusetts 
the hospitals are currently owned by senior housing but operated by healthsouth 
recently  the massachusetts superior court has decided that senior housing validly terminated healthsouth s lease and ordered healthsouth to cooperate in the transfer of the hospitals operations to a new tenant designated by senior housing 
healthsouth has appealed these decisions  but the trial court and the appeals court have both denied healthsouth s requests to stay these decisions until the appeal is decided 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we pay to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
rmr provides management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
aggregate fees earned by rmr for services during  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
we pay a proportionate share of rmr s costs in providing that function 
our audit committee approves the identity and salary of the individual serving as our director of internal audit  as well as the pro rata share of the costs which we pay 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including one of our landlords  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  the shared services agreement allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
prior to october   rmr was beneficially owned by messrs 
barry m 
portnoy and gerard m 
martin  each a managing director and member of our board of directors 
effective october   messrs 
barry m 
portnoy and his son  adam d 
portnoy  acquired mr 
martin s beneficial ownership interest in rmr 
mr 
adam d 
portnoy is an executive officer of rmr and the executive vice president of hrpt 
mr 
martin remains a director of rmr and  together with mr 
barry m 
portnoy  continues to serve as one of our managing directors 
all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our independent directors 
mr 
barry m 
portnoy is the majority owner of the building in which our headquarters is located 
this lease expires in we paid rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during  and of   and  respectively 
this lease has been amended at various times to take into account our needs for increasing space and all amendments to this lease have been approved by our independent directors 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  the realizable value of long term assets  accounting for long term care contracts  accounting for business combinations and our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our knowledge and familiarity with the current rules and regulations of these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents or their third party payors  the residents or payors stated intent to pay  the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or appeal proceedings 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could indicate impairment in the value of long lived assets 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset to determine if an impairment loss should be recognized 
we determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected discounted cash flows of properties using standard industry valuation techniques 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
at two of our communities  we offer continuing care contracts under which residents may pay admission fees in exchange for reduced charges during their occupancy 
these fees may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record these fees as obligations and amortize the non refundable amounts into revenue over the actuarially determined remaining lives of the individual residents which are the expected periods of occupancy 
actuarially determined remaining lives are estimates based upon general demographic samplings and averages 
our decision to amortize the non refundable fees over actuarially determined lives is based upon our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for that period 
the actual remaining lives and the actual period of occupancy of the individual residents who pay the non refundable fees may differ materially from these estimates 
in the future  if we find that such differences are material  we may change the actuarial tables which we use and we may change our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for these periods  and these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements 
since we became a separate public company  each of our acquisitions has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
purchase accounting requires that we make certain judgments and estimates based on our experience  including determining the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed 
some of our judgments and estimates are also based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party appraisals 
determining reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves  however  these reserves may prove to be materially inaccurate 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to these premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the us has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also our ability to increase rates paid by medicare and medicaid will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of minimum rental obligations to senior housing and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 
seasonality our business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally

we manage our exposure to this market risk through our monitoring of available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates remain unchanged since december  other than as described below we do not now anticipate any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this risk in the future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million mortgage debt outstanding on december   would increase by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million mortgage debt would decline by about million 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in may as of december   no amounts were outstanding and  as of march   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but could affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates decreased or increased by per annum  our interest expense would decrease or increase by  per year  or per share  based on currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
