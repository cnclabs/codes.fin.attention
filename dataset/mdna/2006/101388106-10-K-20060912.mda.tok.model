we present this supplemental information in the form of non gaap financial measures  which excludes certain non cash items specifically in process research and development charges  acquisition related technology write offs  amortization of intangible assets and stock compensation expense 
we believe that this supplemental  non gaap presentation is useful to investors because it allows for an evaluation of bottomline with a focus on the performance of its core operations 
our executive management team  including our chief operating decision makers  use this same non gaap measure internally to assess the on going performance of bottomline 
since the presentation above is not a gaap measurement of financial performance  there are material limitations to its usefulness on a stand alone basis  including the lack of comparability of this presentation to the gaap financial results of other companies 
accordingly the non gaap information should not be used in isolation to  or as a substitute for  our gaap results 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to comply with recent accounting pronouncements and for comparative purposes 
to ensure comparability  these reclassifications also reflect changes in where certain classes of employees are now reported within our operating expense categories

overview we provide software products and services for business payments and invoice management 
our solutions enable organizations to automate  manage  standardize and control transaction based processes across the enterprise  particularly those that involve making payments  sending and receiving invoices  receiving payments  generating business documents and conducting electronic banking 
we offer software designed to run on site at the customer s location as well as hosted solutions 
historically  our software has been sold predominantly on a perpetual license basis 
we expect that a large part of our focus going forward will be on selling subscription and transaction based product offerings 
our software applications address the global payment and related process requirements of business enterprises  permitting them to achieve greater operating efficiency  increase visibility of the cash cycle and better comply with applicable regulations and standards 
we support a broad range of global networks and payment standards  including automated clearing house ach  financial electronic data interchange edi  fed wire transfer  bacs ach for the uk  bacstel ip and swift  as well as new and evolving standards 
during fiscal  our revenue increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to growth in our subscription and transaction revenues  driven by the contribution of revenue from hmsl  a company we acquired in april  increases in revenue from our legal exchange product in north america complemented by the revenue contribution from visibillity which we acquired in december  and the contribution of revenue from tranmit which we acquired in january the increase in revenue was offset in part by a decrease in bacstel ip software license revenues in the uk  as the technology adoption date of december passed 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenue through our international operations  the majority of which was attributable to our bottomline europe 
table of contents subsidiary 
we expect future revenue growth to be driven from increased purchases by both new and existing financial institution customers in both north america and international markets  the continued market adoption of our legal exchange product in the us  the contribution of a full year of revenue from our recent acquisitions and the contribution of revenue from our subscription and transaction based products 
we incurred a net loss of million in the fiscal year ended june  compared to net income of million in fiscal year for the fiscal year ended june   our operating results were significantly impacted  in the form of additional expense  by the adoption of sfas r  share based payment 
as a result of our adoption of sfas r  the fair value of all stock based compensation is now recorded as expense in our financial statements  rather than as a footnote disclosure 
accordingly  we recorded approximately million in stock compensation expense for the fiscal year ended june  additionally  the decrease in software license revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year significantly impacted our operating results in the form of reduced gross profit 
revenue sources our revenues are derived from multiple sources  and are reported under the following classifications software license fees 
software license revenues  which we derive from our software applications  are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased 
fees from the sale of software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer 
however  certain of our software arrangements  particularly those related to banking and financial institution customers  are recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 
service and maintenance fees 
our service and maintenance revenues consist of subscription and transaction fees  professional services fees and customer support and maintenance fees 
transaction revenues relating to our legal exchange product and our other transactional based product offerings are typically recognized at the time transactions are processed 
subscription revenues are typically recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period 
revenues relating to professional services not associated with customized software solutions are normally recognized at the time services are rendered 
professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project 
software maintenance fees which are established as a percentage typically of the list price for the software license are recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance period 
certain of our offerings  particularly our outsourced and transactional service offerings  often require customers to pay a non refundable set up or installation fee 
in such cases  since the up front payment does not reflect a separate earnings process by bottomline  these fees are deferred and are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship  which is generally four years 
going forward  we expect that a large part of our focus will be on growing the revenue contribution from our subscription and transaction based product offerings  which are currently reported as a component of service and maintenance revenues 
equipment and supplies revenues 
we derive equipment and supplies revenues from the sale of printers  check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners 
these revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery 
equipment and supplies revenue also includes postage and shipping related charges billed to customers 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance 
we refer to such policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate  and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to stock based compensation  revenue recognition and goodwill and intangible assets 
these critical policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are discussed below 
in addition  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
share based payments effective july   we adopted accounting rules sfas r  share based payment requiring the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
prior to this  the estimated fair value associated with such awards was not recorded as an expense  but rather was disclosed in a footnote to our financial statements 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded approximately million of expense associated with share based payments  with the majority of this expense  approximately million  attributable to employee stock options 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used a black scholes pricing model which requires the consideration of the following variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  the expected volatility of our common stock  expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
for purposes of calculating an estimated expected term  we reviewed our historic option activity  considered the underlying option holding period including the holding period inherent in currently vested but unexercised options and  for stock options granted during  estimated an expected term of years 
in estimating our stock price volatility  we analyzed our historical volatility for a period equal to the expected term of our stock option awards  and  by reference to actual stock prices during this period  calculated an estimated volatility for options granted during ranging from to 
we believe that each of these estimates  both expected term and volatility  is reasonable in light of the historic data we analyzed 
however  as with any estimate  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
the specific valuation assumptions noted above were applied to stock options that were granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas r  however a significant amount of the stock option expense recorded during fiscal year relates to the continued vesting of stock options that were granted prior to july  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards  which were also calculated using a black scholes option pricing model  have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
upon our adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation cost only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
this 
table of contents requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to july  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited such as by employee separation prior to vesting  and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate 
our annual forfeiture estimate was calculated at 
from a sensitivity perspective  had we estimated our forfeiture rate at  stock compensation expense for would have increased by  revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of both perpetual and subscription based software licenses  transactional based outsourced offerings  professional services  software maintenance and equipment and supplies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon transfer of product title to the customer  or completion of services rendered 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer 
excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis  our normal customer payment terms do not exceed days 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
our sales arrangements can contain multiple revenue elements  such as perpetual or subscription based software licenses  transaction fees  professional services  and software maintenance 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue allocated to the software element is based on the residual method  under which revenue equal to the fair value of professional services and software support is allocated to those items and recognized as revenue as those items are delivered 
any residual or remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license 
revenue is recognized for each element when each of the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain of our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment as described above  and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting 
under contract accounting  companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method 
the completed contract method recognizes revenue only upon contract completion  and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and costs on a contract as the work progresses 
we have historically used the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term and custom contracts  since we believe that we can make reasonably reliable estimates of progress toward completion 
progress is measured based on labor hours  as measured at the end of each reporting period  as a percentage of total expected labor hours 
accordingly  the revenue we record in any reporting period for arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining labor hours that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations 
our estimates at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final project results  as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion 
to mitigate this risk  we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis  as well as at the end of each reporting period  for purposes of evaluating cumulative labor hours incurred and verifying the estimated remaining effort to completion  so that our estimates are always based on the most current projections available 
goodwill and intangible assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas relating to goodwill and intangible assets 
we were required 
table of contents to perform a transitional impairment test upon adoption to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
based on the results of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with goodwill in bottomline europe 
we were required to calculate the fair value of our reporting units in connection with this impairment review 
the principal component of each fair value calculation was the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there were a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  however our estimates were consistent with our internal planning assumptions 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates included  but were not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  the level of bottomline us products that will be sold by bottomline europe  our software product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
the use of different assumptions or projections  in some or all of the areas noted above  would likely have resulted in different fair value results  thus affecting our determination of the overall goodwill impairment 
since our adoption of sfas  we have tested our goodwill annually for impairment and for fiscal we performed this review during our fourth quarter which is the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review 
based on this review  we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 
our analysis was performed at the reporting unit level 
our analysis of goodwill impairment required an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  which is an inherently subjective process 
based on the results of our impairment review we concluded that none of our reporting units were impaired 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of future periodic impairment reviews 
to the extent that future impairment charges occurred  it would likely have a material impact on our financial results 
at june   the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was approximately million 
in addition to our annual goodwill impairment review  we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value of our other intangible assets 
these intangible assets consist primarily of acquired core technology and customer related intangibles such as acquired customer lists and customer contracts 
in evaluating potential impairment of these assets  we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including whether there has been a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  whether there has been a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 
if indicators of impairment are present  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made  to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered 
these 
table of contents estimates involve significant subjectivity 
at june   the carrying value of our intangible assets  excluding goodwill  was million 
as a result of our fiscal impairment review  none of these assets were deemed to be impaired 
valuation of acquired intangible assets in connection with our recent acquisitions we recorded several intangible assets relating principally to acquired technology and customer related intangible assets 
the valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections 
the principal component of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there are a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and  while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
further  the projections required for the valuation process normally utilize a ten year forecast  which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates include  but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  our technology and product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  companies are required to recognize as expense the estimated fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of employee stock options 
pro forma disclosure of the estimated expense impact of such awards is no longer an alternative to expense recognition within the financial statements 
sfas r became effective for public companies in the first annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted the provisions of sfas r effective july   the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas r during fiscal had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the form of additional expense 
income tax uncertainties in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin creates a single accounting and disclosure model for uncertain tax positions  provides guidance on the minimum threshold that a tax uncertainty is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions taken by a company  both those deemed to be routine as well as those for which there may be a high degree of uncertainty 
fin establishes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
the first step  recognition  occurs when a company concludes based solely on the technical aspects of the tax matter that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by a taxing authority 
the second step  measurement  is only considered 
table of contents after step one has been satisfied and measures any tax benefit at the largest amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the uncertainty 
tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard  when they are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently concludes that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin also significantly expands the financial statement disclosure requirements relating to uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  we will adopt the pronouncement effective july  differences between the amounts recognized in the balance sheet prior to adoption and the amounts recognized in the balance sheet after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements

table of contents fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues by segment as of july   we consolidated the structure of our internal operating segments and changed the nature of the financial information that is provided to and used by our chief operating decision makers 
we have aggregated similar operating segments into two reportable segments  licensed technology and outsourced solutions 
the change in segment composition on july  resulted in the consolidation of our licensed technology and tailored solutions segments into a single segment  licensed technology  and that change is reflected for all financial periods presented 
the following table represents our revenues by segment for the year ended june  in thousands increase decrease between periods revenues as of total revenues as of total revenues change licensed technology outsourced solutions licensed technology 
the revenue decrease for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily attributable to a decrease in software license revenue as a result of the conclusion of the bacstel ip conversion in the uk and due to a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
the decrease was offset in part by an increase in professional services revenues in the us as a result of the revenue contribution from several large projects with financial institution customers 
we expect that revenues will decrease in fiscal as compared to revenues reported in fiscal  as a result of our on going transition to subscription and transaction based pricing for our purchase to pay offerings  offset in part by revenue growth from our banking product offerings 
outsourced solutions 
the revenue increase for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to a full year of revenue contribution from hmsl  which we acquired in april  and increases in revenue from our legal exchange product in the us  in part as a result of the revenue contribution from visibillity which we acquired in december and the revenue contribution from tranmit  which we acquired in january we expect that revenues will increase in fiscal compared to revenues reported in fiscal revenues by category fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands revenues software licenses service and maintenance equipment and supplies total revenues the overall revenue increase in was due primarily to increases in legal exchange revenues and the revenue contribution from our acquisitions in fiscal and  offset in part by a decrease in software license revenues in the uk as the bacstel ip initiative ended

table of contents software licenses 
the decrease in software license revenues was due principally to a decrease in software license revenues in the uk as the bacstel ip initiative ended and due to a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
based on current plans  we anticipate that software license revenues will decline slightly during as a result of our on going transition to a subscription and transaction based pricing model 
service and maintenance 
the increase in service and maintenance revenues occurred primarily as a result of a full year of revenue contribution from hmsl  which we acquired in april  increases in legal exchange revenues and the revenue contribution from our acquisitions of visibillity and tranmit which were completed during fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
based on current plans  we anticipate that service and maintenance revenues will increase in fiscal year equipment and supplies 
the decrease in equipment and supplies revenues was primarily due to decreases in order flow in the uk  due in part to our continued de emphasis of this revenue stream and by a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  offset in part by several large equipment orders with financial institution customers in the us 
we anticipate that equipment and supplies revenues will decline slightly during as a result of our continued de emphasis of this revenue stream

software license costs remained consistent at of software license revenues in the fiscal years ended june  and the decrease in software license costs in dollar terms was due to the overall decrease in software license revenues 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license costs  as a percentage of software license revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service  maintenance and help desk support staffs  as well as expenses associated with third party contractors used to complement our professional services team 
service and maintenance costs excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense remained consistent at of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal years ended june  and the increase in service and maintenance costs in dollar terms was consistent with the overall increases in service and maintenance revenues and due primarily to higher third party costs associated with bacstel ip product implementations in the uk and increased operating costs associated with our acquisitions of hmsl  visibillity and tranmit 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell  as well as freight  shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products 
equipment and supplies costs increased to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and trade show participation 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to decreased commissions and other employee compensation costs and a decrease in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  offset by increases in expenses associated with the operations of hmsl  visibillity and tranmit 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively consistent  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year product development and engineering 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development  which continues to be focused on enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands 
product development and engineering expenses increased in the us principally as a result of contract employee costs associated with development efforts on certain of our banking products 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in employee related expenses in australia due to a decrease in headcount 
we anticipate that product development and engineering expenses will remain relatively consistent  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was attributable to the operations of hmsl  visibillity and tranmit  and an increase in employee and contract labor costs in the us and the uk 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year 
table of contents stock compensation expense 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded approximately million of expense associated with share based payments in connection with our july  adoption of sfas r 
the expense associated with these awards is recorded as expense within the same functional expense category as cash compensation for the respective employee is recorded 
for the fiscal year ended june   stock compensation expense was allocated as follows in thousands cost of revenues service and maintenance sales and marketing product development and engineering general and administrative amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense increased for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  the increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of intangible assets arising from our acquisitions of hmsl  visibillity  tranmit and a patent 
we anticipate that amortization expense will approximate million for fiscal year other income expense  net fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net other income  net interest income 
the increase in interest income in fiscal was attributable to an increase in rates of return during the year and  as a result of proceeds raised in our follow on offering of common stock in july  an increase in our average investment balances throughout the year 
interest expense 
interest expense remained minimal in fiscal as compared to fiscal other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the change from a net expense in to income in was due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the british pound during fiscal provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in income tax expense was due principally to an increase in the income tax expense associated with our australian operations  an increase in deferred income tax expense in the us as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance associated with specific us deferred tax assets and the absence of an income tax benefit that was recorded in fiscal as a result of an income tax refund received in that year 
net loss 
the net loss for was primarily due to a decrease in software license revenues which carry a very high gross margin  the expense impact associated with stock based compensation as a result of accounting rules that we adopted on july   and an increase in expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets

software licenses 
the increase in software license revenues was due principally to the increased contribution of revenue from the uk as a result of the bacstel ip initiative and  to a lesser extent  a full year s revenue contribution from createform and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our webseries licenses in the us and  to a lesser extent a decrease in license fees from certain of our legacy payment products 
service and maintenance 
the increase in service and maintenance revenues was due to an increase in professional services revenues in the uk related to bacstel ip deployments  an increase in revenues from our legal exchange product in the us  a full year s revenue contribution from createform and from the revenue contribution of hmsl  partially offset by a decrease in the professional services associated with certain of our legacy products in the us
