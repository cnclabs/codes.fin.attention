table of contents recent developments on december  the company completed its acquisition of smartwool corporation smartwool  a company that designs  develops  markets and distributes premium performance socks  apparel and accessories for men  women and children 
the purchase price was million  net of cash acquired  and was funded through our existing cash balances 
due to the timing of the close  smartwool had a minimal impact on earnings 
we anticipate the acquisition of smartwool will add approximately to our diluted eps in  with benefits weighted toward the second half of the year 
on february   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of our class a common stock 
this additional program supplements the company s current share authorization  of which approximately million shares were outstanding as of december  overview our principal strategic goal is to become the authentic outdoor brand of choice globally 
we continue to develop a diverse portfolio of footwear  apparel and accessories that reinforces the functional performance  benefits and classic styling that consumers have come to expect from our brand 
we sell our products to consumers who embrace an outdoor inspired lifestyle through high quality distribution channels  including our own retail stores  which reinforce the premium positioning of the timberland brand 
to deliver against our long term goals  we are focused on driving progress on key strategic fronts 
these include enhancing our leadership position in our core footwear business  capturing the opportunity that we see for outdoor inspired apparel  extending enterprise reach through development of new brand platforms and brand building licensing arrangements  expanding geographically and driving operational and financial excellence while setting the standard for commitment to the community and striving to be a global employer of choice 
highlights of our financial performance include the following revenue increased to  million  driven by growth in our international operations  which offset a decline in our us business 
operating profits increased to million 
operating margin increased from to reflecting moderate gross margin gains and controlled cost growth  which offset impacts from restructuring charges related to the consolidation of our caribbean manufacturing facilities 
net income increased to million 
diluted earnings per share increased by from to 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million 
 shares of our class a common stock were repurchased during the year 
restructuring charges related to the consolidation of our caribbean manufacturing facilities reduced operating profits by million 
excluding this impact  operating profit  net income and diluted eps increased  and  respectively  in for  we are targeting mid single digit revenue growth and moderate declines in comparable eps to for the purpose of comparison  we estimate that diluted eps would have been approximately  after excluding restructuring costs and including costs related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan see reconciliation of diluted eps to diluted eps excluding restructuring and related costs and including stock based employee compensation costs below 
restructuring costs related to the company s caribbean manufacturing operations were million in and are estimated to be approximately million in q our financial outlook reflects anticipated pressure on gross margins in  driven by product mix changes and macro factors such as higher oil related product costs 
we are also planning for high single digit 
table of contents growth in operating expenses  driven by investments to advance timberland s global development and organization capability and by incremental equity based compensation costs  reflecting new accounting requirements 
impacts from these factors are expected to be greater in the first half of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  realization of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  derivatives  other contingencies  impairment of assets  incentive compensation accruals and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying our critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers  retail store revenues  license fees and royalties 
we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of the sale 
license fees and royalties are recognized as earned per the terms of our licensing and royalty agreements 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated wholesale and retail customer returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances  as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances  which are known to us but which have not yet been received 
our total reserves for sales returns and allowances were million at december  and million at december  the actual amount of customer returns and allowances  which are inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to sales returns and allowances are appropriate  we record either a reduction or an increase in sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates for losses relating to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses primarily based upon our historical rate of credit losses and our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
our allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from disputes  which arise with respect to the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers owe to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are appropriate  we record either an increase or decrease to selling expense in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of the inventory  we provide a reserve for the difference as a charge to cost of sales 
our reserves related to inventory valuation totaled million at december  and million at december  if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would decrease or increase our cost of sales and net income in the period in which they are recognized 
derivatives we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income as we purchase and sell goods in foreign markets in their local currencies 
we use derivative instruments  specifically forward contracts  to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency transactions 
we use our operating budget and periodic forecasts to estimate future economic exposure and to determine the appropriate levels and timing of related hedging transactions 
we closely monitor our foreign currency exposure and adjust our hedge positions accordingly 
our estimates of anticipated transactions could fluctuate over time and could vary from the ultimate transactions see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
future operating results could be impacted by adjustments to these estimates 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liabilities  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
we disclose a contingent liability when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
estimating probable losses requires analysis and judgment about the potential actions 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we do not believe that any pending legal proceeding or claims will have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability  we would record additional expense during the period in which the loss or change in estimate occurred 
long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market value 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about expected future operating performance 
those estimates of undiscounted cash flows could differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to business operations 
for fiscal  and  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets has been recorded 
incentive compensation accruals we use incentive compensation plans to link compensation to the achievement of specific annual performance targets 
we accrue for this liability during each year based on certain estimates and assumptions 
the amount paid  based on actual performance  could differ from our accrual 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary book to tax differences 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we were unable to generate sufficient future 
table of contents taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment could be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
we estimate what the effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our effective tax rate estimate to from the previous estimate of used for the first three quarters of we have provided reserves for certain tax matters  both domestic and foreign  which we believe could result in additional tax being due 
any additional assessment or reduction of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in the company s effective tax rate

however  as discussed in item a  risk factors  several risks and uncertainties could cause the company to need to raise additional capital through equity and or debt financing

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  million and million  respectively 
these letters of credit were issued predominantly for the purchase of inventory 
the reduction in letters of credit outstanding in is attributable to more vendors transitioning to open account payment arrangements 
as of december   the company had million in foreign currency contracts outstanding  all of which are due to settle within the next months see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k 
we have the following off balance sheet arrangements total amounts december  committed dollars in millions lines of credit letters of credit foreign currency contracts total we use funds from operations and unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as the primary sources of financing for our seasonal and other working capital requirements 
our principal risks to these sources of financing are the impact on our financial condition from economic downturns  a decrease in the demand for our products  increases in the prices of materials and a variety of other factors 
we anticipate that capital requirements for will be met through the use of our current cash balances  through our existing credit facilities which places certain limitations on additional debt  stock repurchases  acquisitions and on the amount of dividends we may pay  and also contains certain other financial and operating covenants and through cash flow from operations  without the need for additional permanent financing 
however  if the need arises  our ability to obtain any additional credit facilities will depend upon prevailing market conditions  our financial condition and the terms and conditions of such additional facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should result in an appropriate level of protection against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and us dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments 
in addition  we use derivative instruments in our hedging of foreign currency transactions 
these debt instruments and derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
cash balances are invested in high grade securities with terms less than three months 
we have available unsecured committed and uncommitted lines of credit as sources of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under these credit agreements bear interest at variable rates based on either lenders cost of funds  plus an applicable spread  or prevailing money market rates 
at december   december  and december   we had no short term or long term debt outstanding 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our european operating subsidiaries and  to a lesser degree  our asian and canadian operating subsidiaries 
we seek to minimize the impact of these foreign currency fluctuations by hedging the related transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
these foreign currency forward contracts will expire in months or less 
based upon sensitivity analysis as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates would cause the fair value of our financial instruments to increase decrease by approximately million  compared with million at december  the decrease at december   compared with december   is related to our choice to hedge a lesser portion of our exposure at december  than the portion of our exposure that was hedged at december   as determined in accordance with our hedging policy  as well as a reduction of our foreign currency denominated net assets at december  compared with december
