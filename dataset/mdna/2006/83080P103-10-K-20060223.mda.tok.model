the growth was driven by increases in service charge and deposit fee income  trust income  transaction fee and brokerage commissions 
continued growth reflects sky financial s focus on growing its fee based businesses  in addition to contributions from acquisitions 
one of sky financial s five strategic priorities is to increase its fee based revenue 
a component of this is to increase total non interest income as a percentage of total revenue net interest income  fully tax equivalent plus non interest income

total volume of loans sold in was  a decrease of  or from after decreasing  or from to the overall increase in mortgage interest rates in led to an anticipated slow down in prepayment rates on mortgages which add to the value of the servicing rights and generated the impairment recapture

credit risk for residential mortgage loans arises from borrowers lacking the ability or willingness to repay the loan  and by a shortfall in the value of the residential mortgages in relation to the outstanding loan balance in the event of a default and subsequent liquidation of the real estate collateral 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes both conforming and nonconforming mortgage loans 
conforming mortgage loans represent loans originated in accordance with underwriting standards set forth by the government sponsored entities gses of federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  and the government national mortgage association gnma  who serve as the primary purchasers of loans sold in the secondary mortgage market by mortgage lenders

the change in mix reflects growth in this portfolio due to new business development in existing regional markets 
as part of its commercial loan portfolio  sky financial engages in financing pools of loans with a specialty consumer finance company 
this relationship has currently over pools in this portfolio type 
these pools are made up of almost exclusively family residential mortgage loans located throughout the country that have some type of impairment associated with them 
in addition  sky financial participated in a small portfolio of shared national credits 
these individual credit relationships total less than one half of one percent of the total loan portfolio with the businesses located in our current market area 
the remaining portion of sky financial s loan portfolio is installment loans  credit card loans and other loans  which decreased to of the loan portfolio from in the prior year 
the decrease is due to a reduced emphasis on indirect auto loans and a change in consumer patterns to greater use of home equity lending

under performing assets residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of the collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
at december   impaired loans were  compared with  at december   the decrease was due primarily to improved asset quality at the end of due to on going efforts to reduce problem loans 
non accrual loans are comprised principally of loans days past due as well as certain loans  which are current but where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the repayment terms 
interest previously accrued and not yet paid on non accrual loans is reversed or charged against the allowance for credit losses during the period in which the loan is placed in a non accrual status  except where sky financial has determined that such loans are adequately secured as to principal and interest 
interest earned thereafter is included in income only to the extent that it is received in cash 
in certain cases  interest received may be credited against principal outstanding under the cost recovery method 
non accrual loans decreased  from  at december  to  at year end the decrease in non accrual loans in included a  decrease in non accrual loans secured by pools of commercial leases guaranteed by surety bonds as well as additional reductions and charge offs 
for the year ended december   the amount of interest income that would have been recorded under the original loan terms for total loans classified as non accrual and restructured was  the amount actually collected and recorded  as interest income for these loans  was  at december   loans secured by pools of commercial leases on non accrual status was  down from  at year end the reduction in these loans is due to cash collections on the loans during the year and the sale of million of these non accrual loans for million in cash proceeds 
these loans are guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies issued by two creditworthy insurance companies 
sky is engaged in litigation with these insurance companies to enforce their payment obligations  as are a number of other banks nationwide 
these non accrual loans are currently reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of the unpaid balance  under contractual terms 
after consultation with its counsel as to the strength of its position  sky financial believes that the credits are well secured and that the prospects for recovery of its unpaid balance are probable 
at december   non performing assets were  a decrease from  at the prior year end 
the decrease was primarily in non performing loans  which at yearend  totaled  or of total loans outstanding  compared with  or  of total loans outstanding at year end in addition  all  of non performing investments outstanding at year end were settled or sold during the non performing investments consisted of two securities that were on non accrual  a franklin county  ohio revenue bond with a net outstanding balance of million and a pooled commercial loan package in partial default with a net outstanding balance of million 
loans now performing  but where some concerns exist as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms defined as loans rated substandard or worse  but excluding non accrual and restructured loans  approximated  and  at december  and  respectively  and are being closely monitored by management and the boards of directors of sky financial and its subsidiaries 
the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans  but believes that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
the decrease in loans where some concern exists is indicative of the increased focus on credit quality and stricter credit standards in loan categories

all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
sky financial recognizes these credit risks as a necessary element of its business activity 
to assist in identifying and managing potential loan losses  sky financial maintains a loan review function that continuously evaluates individual credit relationships as well as overall loan portfolio conditions 
one of the primary objectives of this loan review function is to make recommendations to management as to both specific loss reserves and overall portfolio loss reserves 
the provision for credit losses for was  compared with  for and  in the change in the provision for credit losses was attributable to higher levels of net charge offs mostly related to several large commercial relationships and growth in the loan portfolio  partially offset by an overall reduction in the credit risk profile facilitated by a reduction in non accrual loans

as a result of the belmont bancorp and falls bank acquisitions  sky financial transferred  and of allowance for credit losses  respectively 

table of contents sky financial maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that sky financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends  and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings

at year end  the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was  compared with  at year end the decrease in the allowance in was attributable to an overall reduction in the credit risk profile facilitated by a reduction in non accrual loans and loans requiring a specific reserve allocation 
the increase to the allowance in was due primarily to the overall growth in total loans of and the adjustment of loss factors for components of certain segments within the loan portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the loans secured by pools of commercial leases and guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies decreased in due a reduction in loan balances to  as well as receiving a court judgment relating to  of the portfolio

in securities the investment portfolio at sky financial is used as a management tool to maintain acceptable levels of liquidity and exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the portfolio yield is maximized once these criteria are satisfied 
in recent years  the portfolio has shifted to include a greater percentage of mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities offer monthly principal and interest and may be used as collateral in a variety of financial transactions to secure sources of wholesale funding 
the market for agency mortgage backed securities is large and liquid 
it is the practice of sky financial to purchase mortgage backed securities with average expected lives of two to five years 
because this type of security may extend or contract  a pre purchase analysis is completed 
most securities purchased have structures that limit changes to duration as market rates change

out of the securities sold   were corporate trust preferred issues that were sold due to management s decision to minimize risk by liquidating these investments 
a net gain of  was recognized on these sales 
securities sold totaling  were mortgage backed securities that had paid down significantly from the original purchase amount 
among the issues considered by management in the decision to sell mortgage backed securities that have paid down significantly included the market value of the investment  the current book yield  the remaining expected life of the investment  the cost of administration of the security  the stability of the expected remaining life and the likely reinvestment rate 
portfolio management is enhanced by maintaining the number of bonds in the portfolio to a reasonable number 
the sale of these securities resulted in a net gain for the year 
during the fourth quarter  the franklin county multi family housing revenue bond was sold to a third party for  a net gain of was realized on the sale 
this investment had been written down as other than temporarily impaired as part of the merger with metropolitan bank in in addition  the bpa commercial capital llc commercial mortgage pass through certificate was called at  by the servicer in conjunction with the settlement of an insurance claim

the variable cash flows present additional risk to sky financial in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market interest rates 
this additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields 
sky financial utilizes a variety of tools to monitor and minimize this risk 
all securities must pass a stress test at the time of purchase estimating how the security would perform in various interest rate environments 
additionally  the corporate investment policy defines certain types of high risk securities ineligible for purchase  including securities that may not return full principal to sky financial 
it is also the practice of sky financial to minimize premiums paid on mortgage securities to avoid yield reduction if prepayments accelerate 
the total premium on mortgage securities was

among the factors that are considered in determining intent and ability is a review of capital adequacy  interest rate risk profile and liquidity at sky financial

funding sources sky financial obtains its funding through a variety of sources 
retail deposits are gathered from individuals and businesses within the local communities served by the banking affiliate 
deposits encompass the full range of banking products including checking  savings and time deposits 
in addition  sky financial obtains funds under a number of borrowing arrangements 
the banking affiliate is a member of the federal home loan bank and may obtain both overnight and term advances 
the banking affiliate also obtains funds through securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds lines

the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
deposits without a stated maturity have been placed in the one year and less category for this presentation based on the clients ability to withdraw on a daily basis

as such  interest charges on related contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest bearing assets 
sky financial obtains its funding from a variety of sources including retail and commercial deposits  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and debt securities offered by sky financial 
by utilizing a mixture of these funding sources  sky financial is able to manage its contractual repayment dates 
sky financial also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required to either receive cash or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the contracts are primarily interest rate swaps and cash is settled quarterly 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the table above 
a schedule of significant off balance sheet commitments at december   is included in table table significant commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit letters of credit these commitments are extended to clients in the normal course of business and are subject to the same credit policies as making on balance commitments 
because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not represent future cash flow requirements 
liquidity management management of liquidity is of continuing importance to the banking industry 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows of deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
to meet the needs of the clients and manage the risk of the bank  financial institutions have developed innovative ways to meet clients needs while at the same time managing both liquidity and interest rate risk 
this is being done primarily through liquidity management and the balance of deposit growth and alternative sources of borrowing 
certificates of deposit provide sky financial with a dependable source of funding 
however  market pricing can be highly competitive and this source of funds must be prudently managed 
as of december   a total of  of time deposits mature in the next twelve months 
the maturities are reasonably disbursed across the year and there are no unusual concentrations of individual clients 
at sky financial  time deposit maturities are monitored through the corporate asset liability committee alco 
maturing balances are summarized by month  as well as original term and current rate 
heavy maturity periods are monitored closely and proactive marketing plans are created that address both the client and sky financial s needs and preferences 
regional management along with funds management meets weekly to discuss general economic and market conditions 
during this meeting  each region reports the results of the prior week s pricing and promotional efforts 
each region then determines its rates for the coming week 
regional pricing allows sky financial to attract deposits at the most efficient cost available 
time deposit maturities are monitored and the percent retained is reported monthly to alco 
management of sky financial is confident that a significant portion of the scheduled maturities will be retained in in the unlikely event that these are not retained by sky financial  a minimum liquidity ratio has been established at of non collateralized liabilities 
this ratio consists of readily marketable securities and unused borrowing capacity 
at least of the assets must be in unencumbered marketable assets 
in addition  sky financial has a standing contingent liquidity management plan that prioritizes the steps needed to compensate for temporary disruptions in liquidity 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  sky financial s banking subsidiary maintains adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities  unused borrowing capacity  security repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased

the banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the fhlb provides a reliable source of funds with a wide variety of terms and structures 
as of december   the banking subsidiary had total credit availability with the fhlb of  of which   was outstanding 
at the end of  sky financial s share repurchase program had two million shares remaining

sky financial is a holding company and does not conduct operations 
its primary sources of liquidity are borrowings from outside sources and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
for the banking subsidiary  regulatory approval is required in order to pay dividends in excess of the subsidiary s earnings retained for the current year plus retained net profits for the prior two years

sky financial maintains a  line of credit with a group of unaffiliated banks that expires may  it is anticipated that the line will be renewed 
as of december   sky financial had no outstanding balance on the line of credit 
the corporation manages liquidity risk in accordance with established policies primarily through the alco 
management has increased its monitoring of liquidity levels and has implemented strategies to increase liquidity 
strategies implemented in and include new retail  deposit retention and growth initiatives  an increased portfolio of a laddered maturity of brokered cds and additional federal funds lines 
capital resources shareholders equity at year end totaled  compared to  at december   an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to net retained earnings net income less dividends of  and the issuance of stock for acquisitions and for the exercise of stock options 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in shareholders equity from the repurchase of shares 
the federal reserve board has established risk based capital guidelines that must be observed by financial holding companies and banks 
sky financial has consistently maintained the regulatory capital ratios of the corporation and its bank above well capitalized requirements 
under capital adequacy guidelines  sky financial and sky bank must meet specific quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as determined under regulatory accounting practices 
sky financial s and sky bank s capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
management believes  as of december   sky financial and sky bank meet all capital adequacy requirements for which they are subject 
at december   sky financial s and sky bank s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets as defined by the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action were and 
the capital position is managed through changes to balance sheet size and composition  issuance of debt and equity instruments  treasury stock activities  dividend policies and retention of earnings 
in late  the four federal banking agencies the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the federal deposit insurance corporation  and the office of thrift supervision published an interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding potential revisions to the existing risk based capital framework 
these changes would apply to banks  bank holding companies  and savings associations 
the potential modifications to the us risk based capital standards including n increasing the number of risk weight categories to which credit exposures may be assigned  n expanding the use of external credit ratings as an indicator of credit risk for externally rated exposures  n expanding the range of collateral and guarantors that may qualify an exposure for lower risk weights  n using loan to value ratios  credit assessments  and other broad measures of credit risk for assigning risk weights to residential mortgages  n modifying the credit conversion factor for various commitments  including those with an original maturity of under one year  n requiring that certain loans days or more past due or in a non accrual status be assigned to a higher risk weight category  n modifying the risk based capital requirements for certain commercial real estate exposures  n increasing the risk sensitivity of capital requirements for other types of retail  multifamily  small business  and commercial exposures  and n assessing a risk based capital charge to reflect the risks in securitizations with early amortization provisions that are backed by revolving retail exposures 
sky financial will continue to monitor these potential changes to the risk based capital standards and will make the necessary changes to ensure that it remains well capitalized 
sky financial s strategic plans include continued growth through acquisitions  which can potentially impact sky financial s capital position 
sky financial may issue additional common stock in conjunction with future acquisitions in order maintain its well capitalized status 
in september  sky financial s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock over the next twelve months  of which shares were repurchased during during sky financial repurchased  shares under the authorization 
sky financial does not currently intend to repurchase additional shares in shares repurchased by sky financial were used in its stock option plans and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   sky financial has  of capital securities with wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  which are considered to be tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
under the federal reserve board s regulatory framework  certain capital securities offered by wholly owned unconsolidated trust preferred entities of sky financial are currently included as tier i regulatory capital 
the federal reserve board issued their final regulations on march  after evaluating whether these capital securities will continue as tier i capital as a result of their deconsolidation under generally accepted accounting principals 
the federal reserve board has determined that these securities will continue to qualify as tier i capital with specific limitations 
the management of sky financial has evaluated these limitations and does not believe they will have a material effect on sky financial or sky bank s tier i capital 
sky financial anticipates issuing approximately  of capital securities to coincide with the acquisition of union federal in the third quarter of market risk management market risk is the risk that a financial institution s earnings and capital  or its ability to meet its business objectives  will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads and or commodity prices 
within sky financial  the dominant market risk exposure is changes in interest rates 

table of contents the negative effect of this exposure is felt through the net interest spread  mortgage banking revenues and the market values of various assets and liabilities 
sky financial manages market risk through its alco at both the subsidiary and consolidated levels 
the committee assesses interest rate risk exposure through three primary measurements rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities or gap ratios  interest rate shock simulations of net interest income at risk  and economic value of equity risk simulation 
sky financial also utilizes interest rate swaps and caps to effectively modify its liability interest rate repricing to more effectively match the repricing characteristics of its assets 
at december   the fair value of sky financial s derivative arrangements aggregated  on contracts with notional amounts of  sky financial monitors and manages its rate sensitivity position to maximize net interest income  while minimizing the risk due to changes in interest rates 
sky financial also uses a rate sensitivity gap analysis to manage its interest rate risk 
the difference between a financial institution s interest rate sensitive assets eg  assets that will mature or reprice within a specific time period and interest rate sensitive liabilities ie liabilities that will mature or reprice within the same time period is commonly referred to as its interest rate sensitivity gap or gap 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period is said to have a positive gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will increase and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will decrease 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive liabilities than interest rate assets within a given time period is said to have a negative gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will decrease and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will increase 
the current policy imposes limits at the six month and month time periods that is measured in terms of the ratio of cumulative rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities 
table presents the gap position of sky financial at december  and table gap position year end year end alco guidelines max min six month one year the interest rate shock simulation analysis measures the potential effect on earnings that an instantaneous parallel change in general interest rates could have on net interest income and economic value of equity 
sky financial applies hypothetical interest rate shocks up  and basis points and down basis points to its financial instruments based on the assumed cash flows 
under the interest rate environment as of december   a declining basis point or greater scenario was improbable and therefore provided no meaningful results 
the economic value of equity measures the price risk of the entire balance sheet by discounting expected cash flows of all assets and liabilities and netting the result 
this provides a longer term view of the interest rate risk profile of the company that is focused on the current economic value of assets and liabilities that make up the balance sheet at a static point in time 
the shock then examines how the economic value of the company would change if market rates were different 
as demonstrated in table  as of december   the projected volatility of net interest income and economic value of equity due to the hypothetical changes in market rates are within alco guidelines 
while transitioning out of a historically low rate environment  sky financial is monitoring the effect of a basis point up scenario

further  the analysis does not necessarily contemplate all actions sky financial may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of sky financial are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not necessarily move with the same velocity or within the same period  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require that sky financial measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
pending acquisition on february   sky financial announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire union federal bank of indianapolis  and its parent company  waterfield mortgage company  incorporated  ft

critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of sky financial are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for credit losses and mortgage servicing rights are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments 
application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in sky financial s financial position or results of operations 
account allowance for credit losses balance sheet reference allowance for credit losses income statement reference provision for credit losses description the allowance for credit losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective due to the aforementioned reasons 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectibility of the loan is unlikely 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
allowances established to provide for losses under commitments to extend credit  or recourse provisions under loan sales agreements or servicing agreements are classified with other liabilities 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract 
residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
sky financial maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance  which represent estimations done pursuant to either fas no 
accounting for contingencies  or fas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
many factors are considered when these grades are assigned to individual loans such as current and past delinquency  financial statements of the borrower  current net realizable value of collateral and the general economic environment and specific economic trends affecting the portfolio 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that sky financial will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
account mortgage servicing rights balance sheet reference other assets income statement reference mortgage banking income description the cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each 
the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  expected prepayment speeds and discount rates  about which management must make assumptions based on future expectations 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
management periodically evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment by stratifying the loans in the servicing portfolio primarily based on loan type  interest rate and region of origination 
impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each stratum  taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon current industry expectations 
an impairment allowance for a stratum is recorded when  and in an amount which  its fair value is less than its carrying value 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in our servicing portfolio will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  because most loans within our servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  we will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected
