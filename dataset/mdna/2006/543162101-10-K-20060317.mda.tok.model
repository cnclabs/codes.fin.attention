item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the following discussion and under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview in fiscal we continued to operate in an environment of significant change  including increasing competition  industry consolidation  continued pricing pressure from third party health plans  increasing generic drug utilization and rising gasoline prices  among other factors 
in this environment  we have undertaken significant organizational and operational changes 
more than three years ago  we began working on five broad categories of strategic initiatives to make longs a stronger competitor and more profitable company supply chain front end sales pharmacy profitability customer service operational processes to date we have made progress in several areas to support these initiatives we have made significant improvements in technology in our supply chain and our stores 
as part of our supply chain upgrade  we have installed a new distribution management system in our front end california distribution centers  a new retail merchandise system in all of our stores  and new procurement and allocation systems that are more integrated with our distribution management and retail merchandise systems 
we plan to begin installing a new system for store ordering  receiving and inventory management in fiscal we are also constructing a new front end distribution center in patterson  california  scheduled for completion in the summer of fiscal  which will allow us to further increase our self distribution 
we have shifted our front end merchandise mix toward our core categories of health  wellness  beauty and convenience 
we believe this shift strengthens our competitive differentiation and improves the profitability of our sales 
centralizing our merchandising and promotions has also allowed us to make progress on developing our private brand merchandise and building our capabilities for increased self distribution of front end merchandise 
we plan to continue to pursue our front end merchandise strategy to expand and enhance our core categories and manage toward a more profitable sales mix 
we remodeled additional stores during fiscal  bringing the total number of stores with our new look to  or approximately of our chain 
we plan to remodel an additional stores in fiscal  and to continue to make more productive use of our non selling square footage in our remodeled stores through diagnostic labs  classrooms  walk in medical clinics and similar offerings 
we have taken several steps to improve our pharmacy profitability in anticipation of continued third party pricing pressure 
these steps include better buying  increased generic utilization  upgraded pharmacy technology and expanded mail order and central fill capabilities 
our goal is to make 
table of contents continued progress on pharmacy procurement  inventory management  in stock position and workflow efficiencies 
we have increased the capabilities of rxamerica  our pharmacy benefit services subsidiary  in preparation for our new medicare prescription drug plan offerings and in order to pursue additional growth in our pharmacy benefit management business 
our goal is to leverage the investments we have made in rxamerica in order to achieve additional growth 
we have improved store productivity and efficiency through more efficient workflow processes  better labor scheduling and creating a safer place to work 
as a result of these efforts our operating and administrative expenses have improved  and we plan to return to more substantial store count growth in fiscal  opening or relocating to stores 
we will continue to pursue further cost reductions in an effort to better leverage our operating and administrative expenses 
we have improved the cash flow performance of underperforming stores 
the sales  gross profit margin  operating margin and cash flow for these stores as a group continued to improve in fiscal we are continuing to monitor the performance of these stores 
we have strengthened the safety culture at longs  resulting in a further reduction in the number of work related accidents 
our workers compensation claims decreased in fiscal from the previous year  and from two years ago 
we intend to continue to improve our safety culture in an effort to preserve the health and welfare of our employees and reduce our workers compensation costs 
the progress we have made on these initiatives to date has enabled us to improve our operating performance  develop the organizational competence for change and improvement  and build a foundation for more profitable growth 
we remain focused on our longer term goal to reduce the gap between our operating margin and those of our largest competitors  and plan to continue our efforts to become a stronger competitor and more profitable company 
on january   the new medicare prescription drug benefit took effect 
this new benefit will impact both our retail drug store and pharmacy benefit services segments 
our retail drug stores are in the networks of all of the major medicare plan sponsors in our region 
rxamerica  our pharmacy benefit services subsidiary  provides pharmacy benefit management services to medicare prescription drug plan sponsors  and began offering three prescription drug plans of its own 
approximately  participants in regions encompassing states and the district of columbia are enrolled in one of the three plans that we offer

growth in the number of stores and higher mail order sales also contributed to total retail drug store sales growth 
pharmacy benefit services revenues were million  compared to million in fiscal pharmacy sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
the increase in same store pharmacy sales was primarily due to continued increases in average retail prescription prices  in addition to higher prescription volumes 
average prescription prices increased due to pharmaceutical cost inflation and the continued introduction and utilization of newer and more expensive drugs 
the increase in average prescription prices was mitigated in part by the increased utilization of lower priced  high volume generic drugs 
we estimate that generic utilization negatively impacted our same store pharmacy sales by approximately percentage points 
we expect that average retail prices for prescription drugs will continue to rise due to pharmaceutical cost inflation and the continued introduction and utilization of newer and more expensive drugs  partially offset by continuing increases in utilization of generic drugs 
the increase in our same store prescription volumes was primarily due to a stronger cold and flu season on the west coast in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect that several favorable industry trends will 
table of contents positively impact our prescription volumes over the long term 
these trends include an aging us population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs  the growing use of prescription drugs as preventive therapy by healthcare providers and the introduction of new drugs 
factors that could offset these favorable trends include increasing competition  including the growth of mail order pharmacies  and rising prescription drug costs  which could cause consumers to reduce their purchases of prescription drugs or third party health plans to reduce their coverage of prescription drug costs for their members 
pharmacy sales were of total drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we expect pharmacy sales to continue to increase as a percentage of total drug store sales as pharmacy sales continue to increase faster than front end sales 
third party health plans covered of our pharmacy sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we expect third party sales to remain over of our total pharmacy sales for the foreseeable future due to significant consumer participation in managed care and other third party plans  including the new medicare prescription drug plans 
front end sales decreased in fiscal from fiscal  with same store front end sales decreasing 
in an ongoing effort to emphasize our competitive differentiation  we are shifting our front end merchandise mix toward our core categories of health  wellness  beauty and convenience 
the decline in same store front end sales was primarily due to lower sales in non core categories as a result of these shifts 
we will continue to make changes to our front end merchandise assortments in an effort to further improve our competitive position and profitability 
a continued industry wide decline in photo processing sales  due to consumers continued migration to digital photography technology  also adversely affected same store front end sales in fiscal our performance is affected by economic conditions such as overall economic growth and unemployment  especially in california  our primary market 
higher gasoline prices have also had a significant impact on consumer spending in our markets 
we expect these factors to continue to affect our front end sales in fiscal the increase in pharmacy benefit services revenues in fiscal was primarily due to million in revenues from three new prescription drug plans offered beginning january  under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the three plans have enrolled approximately  medicare beneficiaries 
these new plans will continue to generate increased revenues in our pharmacy benefit services segment throughout fiscal future revenues from these plans are uncertain because this is a new federally subsidized benefit and we have not previously offered such plans  and because plans are subject to annual bidding and regulatory approval 
fiscal versus fiscal total revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal retail drug store sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store sales increasing 
growth in the number of stores accounted for most of the total increase in retail drug store sales 
higher mail order sales and pharmacy benefit services revenues also contributed to the total revenue increase 
a strike against three major grocery chains in southern california that began in october and ended in february resulted in increased sales in some of our southern california stores  primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimate that the strike favorably impacted our fiscal same store sales by to percentage points 
pharmacy sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
the increase in same store pharmacy sales was primarily due to an increase in the average retail price per prescription over fiscal  partially offset by a decline in same store prescription volume 
the increase in the 
table of contents average retail price per prescription was mitigated in part by the increased utilization of lower priced  high volume generic drugs 
the decrease in our same store prescription volume was partially due to declines in allergy and anti ulcer prescriptions following the conversion of claritin and prilosec from prescription to over the counter status  continued health concerns over women s hormone replacement therapy drugs  and a mild cold and flu season on the west coast 
pharmacy sales were of total drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal third party health plans covered of our pharmacy sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal front end sales increased in fiscal from fiscal  with same store front end sales decreasing 
the decline in same store front end sales was partially due to the southern california grocery strike  which favorably affected fiscal front end sales 
the shift in our front end merchandise mix toward our core categories and continued industry wide decline in photo processing sales also adversely affected same store front end sales in fiscal gross profit fiscal year retail drug store gross profit thousands retail drug store gross profit margin lifo provision thousands prescription drug plan gross profit thousands  n a n a prescription drug plan gross profit margin n a n a fiscal versus fiscal retail drug store gross profit was of retail drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a more profitable merchandise mix through better buying  lower distribution costs and increased utilization of generic drugs  which generally have higher gross profit margins than name brand drugs  partially offset by continued reductions in prescription drug reimbursement levels from third party health plans 
we will continue to make shifts in our front end merchandise assortments in an effort to improve the profitability of our sales mix 
further  our supply chain initiative includes continuing efforts to improve our buying practices and inventory management and reduce our distribution costs 
we also expect that the utilization of lower priced  higher margin generic drugs will continue to increase 
we expect that continued efforts by third party health plans  including government sponsored plans  to reduce prescription drug reimbursement level  will at least partially offset these favorable effects on our gross profit percentage 
we also expect the new medicare prescription drug benefit to result in lower reimbursement levels for prescription drugs provided to medicare participants 
our lifo provision  which is included in the cost of retail drug store sales  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower net inflation compared to last year 
the lifo provision fluctuates with inflation rates  inventory levels and merchandise mix 
in addition to the acquisition cost of inventory sold net of merchandise rebates and allowances  we include in bound freight  receiving  warehousing  purchasing and distribution costs  and advertising expenses net of advertising rebates and allowances in our cost of retail drug store sales 
we classify store occupancy costs as a 
table of contents component of operating and administrative expenses 
our retail drug stores gross profit margins may not be comparable to those of some other retailers who include distribution and advertising costs in their operating expenses  or store occupancy costs in their cost of sales 
prescription drug plan gross profit was of prescription drug plan revenues in fiscal we began offering prescription drug plans through our pharmacy benefit services segment on january  under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of prescription drug plan benefit costs represent our portion of the cost of prescription drugs purchased by medicare participants in one of our prescription drug plans 
such costs include benefit payments during the period to pharmacies  and an estimate for benefit costs incurred but not reported as of the end of the period  reduced by associated manufacturer rebates 
our medicare prescription drug plan business is also seasonal  with profitability peaking in the second half of our fiscal year 
future gross profit margins from these plans are uncertain because this is a new federally subsidized benefit and we have not previously offered such plans 
prescription drug plan benefit costs apply only to prescription drug plan revenues 
revenues generated from pharmacy benefit management services are reported net of reimbursements to participating pharmacies 
fiscal versus fiscal retail drug store gross profit was of retail drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a more profitable sales mix through better buying  improved inventory management and the increased utilization of generic drugs  partially offset by continued reductions in prescription drug reimbursement levels from third party health plans 
retail drug store gross profit in fiscal also included a benefit of million related to the resolution of a pricing dispute with a vendor 
our lifo provision  which is included in cost of sales  was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher net inflation compared to fiscal  when we experienced a deflationary environment in many of our front end categories 
operating and administrative expenses fiscal year operating and administrative expenses thousands operating and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decreased expense rate related primarily to lower workers compensation expenses and improved labor productivity  partially offset by increased expenses in our pharmacy benefit services segment in preparation for our new medicare prescription drug plan offerings 
workers compensation expenses in fiscal included a million benefit from favorable actuarial adjustments to the company s self insured workers compensation reserves 
this compares to a million benefit from favorable actuarial adjustments in fiscal workers compensation expenses were also favorably impacted by lower current period claims accruals and more favorable insurance premiums and other costs 
workers compensation expenses reflect a significant decline in claims and lower costs per claim  which have resulted from our focus on a safe work environment  combined with recent changes in california s workers compensation laws 
the number of our workers compensation claims decreased in fiscal from the previous year 

table of contents we expect these factors to continue to have a favorable effect on our workers compensation programs in the near future 
however  the california state legislature is considering further changes to the state s workers compensation laws that  if enacted  could adversely affect workers compensation costs in the state 
in addition  due to the inherent volatility involved in determining our self insurance reserves  especially in california in the past several years  we cannot predict the nature and extent of future actuarial adjustments to those reserves 
future actuarial adjustments  if any  may not be as significant as those we experienced in fiscal as a result  our total workers compensation expenses could increase in fiscal even if we are successful in continuing to reduce the number of claims and costs per claim 
fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of revenues in both fiscal and fiscal in fiscal we took a series of steps to improve our productivity and reduce our costs 
these steps included a reduction of our administrative workforce by approximately people in our california offices  store labor savings through workflow and staffing changes  modifications to many of our incentive compensation arrangements and the closure of certain support facilities 
these actions  combined with other ongoing cost reduction efforts  resulted in lower operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through the first half of fiscal our operating and administrative expense rate began to increase in the second half of fiscal  primarily due to a lack of leverage on labor and related benefit costs  which increased primarily due to normal annual wage adjustments  against lower than expected sales 
expenses related to our supply chain improvement efforts and development of our pharmacy benefit services segment and mail order services to support potential future growth also increased our operating and administrative expense rate 
workers compensation and other insurance related expenses in fiscal included a million benefit from favorable actuarial adjustments  versus million of net unfavorable actuarial adjustments in fiscal the decrease in our insurance related expenses  including the actuarial reserve adjustments  partially reflected a decline in workers compensation claims and lower costs per claim 
the number of our workers compensation claims decreased in fiscal from the previous year 
operating and administrative expenses in fiscal included net charges of million  or of sales  for employee termination and other costs associated with the reduction of our administrative workforce and closure of certain support facilities and a voluntary separation program for store managers announced in july  partially offset by gains on the disposition of certain properties 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fluctuations over the last three fiscal years reflect variations in the timing of capital expenditures for new store investments  remodels and improvements to existing stores  supply chain improvements and technology  as well as the disposal or replacement of older assets  including those in our remodeled stores 
our depreciation and amortization expenses include accelerated depreciation for assets to be retired before the completion of their originally estimated useful lives  including assets to be removed or replaced in our remodeled stores 
the amount of accelerated depreciation expenses related to store remodels varies based on the level and timing of our remodel activities 
gain on sale of distribution center during fiscal  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for our northern california front end distribution center located in lathrop  california  for net proceeds of million 
we intend to vacate the 
table of contents lathrop facility when our new distribution center in patterson  california  which is currently under construction and scheduled for completion in the summer of fiscal  is fully operational 
the leaseback agreement has a minimum term of months  with an option to extend the lease through september provision for store closures and asset impairments the provision for store closures and asset impairments is summarized as follows fiscal year thousands asset impairments provision for store closures total asset impairments in each of the last three fiscal years  we have identified certain underperforming stores with assets whose carrying values exceeded their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal to write the related store assets down to their estimated fair values 
in fiscal  we also recorded an impairment charge of million related to the write off of abandoned information technology assets 
store closures the following is a summary of the provision for store closures and the related reserve  which is included in long term liabilities fiscal year thousands reserve balance beginning of year provision for present value of noncancellable lease obligations of stores closed  net of estimated sublease income changes in assumptions about future sublease income and other lease related costs total provision for store closures reserve accretion cash payments for lease related costs  net of sublease income reserve balance end of year stores closed we periodically review store operating results and projections and make decisions to close stores in the normal course of business 
we recognize costs associated with store closures when the related liabilities are incurred 
our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the properties  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
many of our previously closed stores have long remaining lease terms  with the longest lease term ending february as a result  changes in these assumptions can significantly impact our store closure reserves 

table of contents there was no reserve accretion in fiscal  because all of the remaining stores included in the reserve were closed prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which required that the initial provision for store closures be recorded at the estimated net present value  and accreted to the full undiscounted value  of the noncancellable lease obligation  net of estimated sublease income 
previous accounting standards required that such provisions be recorded at their full undiscounted values 
legal settlements and other disputes in the second quarter of fiscal  we reached an agreement to settle two purported class action lawsuits related to the calculation of earned overtime wages for certain of our former and current store managers and assistant store managers in california 
the lawsuits alleged that we improperly classified such employees as exempt under california s wage and hour laws 
we denied all liability in these cases  but agreed to the settlement in order to resolve the plaintiff s claims while avoiding protracted litigation 
under the settlement  we made cash payments of million to cover claims by eligible plaintiffs  plaintiff attorneys fees and costs  payments to the named plaintiffs and costs of a third party administrator 
we recorded a charge of million for the total cost of this settlement  including applicable employer payroll taxes  in the second quarter of fiscal  and paid these settlement costs in the second half of the year 
we also recorded a gain of million from the favorable settlement of a separate  unrelated class action lawsuit  for which we had filed a claim as a member of the plaintiff class  which alleged unlawful price fixing and market allocation by certain vitamin manufacturers 
we received the settlement payment in the second quarter of fiscal the combined net charge resulting from these two fiscal settlements was million 
in fiscal  we recorded a combined benefit of million related to settlements of a lease related dispute with one of our landlords and a contract dispute with a former service provider 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal and million in both fiscal and fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower average borrowings 
income taxes our effective income tax rate varies based on the level of our pre tax income and the amount and timing of certain tax deductions and credits 
our effective income tax rates were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that our effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowings on our line of credit 
we use cash to provide working capital for our operations  finance capital expenditures and acquisitions  repay debt  repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends 
we have a secured million revolving line of credit with a syndication of banks  which expires in august and accrues interest at libor based rates 
borrowings on this line of credit are secured by inventory  accounts receivable and certain intangible assets 
as of january   no borrowings were outstanding on our secured line of credit 
the secured revolving line of credit agreement contains customary 
table of contents restrictions but no financial covenants and no limitations on capital expenditures or share repurchases if availability of credit remains above a minimum level 
the agreement also includes an option to increase the credit facility s borrowing and letter of credit capacity from million to million  subject to certain conditions 
borrowings on the line of credit do not require repayment until the expiration date but may be prepaid without penalty 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the agreement as of january  we pay a monthly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
additionally  as of january  we had million in outstanding privately placed promissory notes 
these notes  which mature at various dates through  bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and are secured on the same basis as the secured revolving line of credit 
the notes include penalties for repayment prior to their scheduled maturities 
current maturities of million as of january  constitute regularly scheduled principal payments due in fiscal the privately placed promissory notes contain various customary financial covenants and restrictions 
failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions  or with the restrictions included in our secured revolving line of credit  could adversely affect our ability to manage our cash requirements  and could result in higher interest costs and potentially accelerated repayment requirements 
as of january   we were in compliance with the restrictions and limitations included in these provisions 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements beyond the next months 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to improved operating performance  as reflected by increased net income after adjustments for the non cash gain on the sale of our distribution center and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
the increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and deferred income taxes 
net changes in assets and liabilities and deferred taxes accounted for million of our operating cash flows in fiscal current and other liabilities increased million primarily as a result of the million increase in merchandise inventories and increased pharmacy benefit services payables related to our new prescription drug plans 
pharmacy and other receivables increased million due to higher pharmacy sales and pharmacy benefit services revenues 
net changes in assets and liabilities and deferred taxes accounted for million of our operating cash flows in fiscal merchandise inventories decreased million as a result of improved inventory management in our stores and distribution centers 
current and other liabilities decreased million primarily as a result of lower merchandise inventory levels  partially offset by increased accruals for workers compensation and employee compensation and benefits 
pharmacy and other receivables decreased million  primarily due to the timing of payments from pharmacy benefit services customers  lease related receivables  third party health plans  and vendors  for amounts associated with our contractual purchase arrangements 
fiscal operating cash flows also reflect the reclassification of certain income tax amounts from taxes payable to deferred income taxes as a result of the acceleration of certain income tax deductions resulting from tax planning and optimization efforts 
net changes in assets and liabilities and deferred taxes unfavorably affected our operating cash flows by million in fiscal current and other liabilities increased million primarily as a result of higher 
table of contents inventory levels and improved payment terms with many of our vendors  increased accruals for workers compensation and employee compensation and benefits  and increased taxes payable due to increased current taxes due and the effect of income tax credits in fiscal  which had the effect of lowering taxes payable in fiscal merchandise inventories increased million as a result of our efforts to remain in stock during a system conversion in our northern california distribution center and the southern california grocery strike 
pharmacy and other receivables increased million primarily due to increased amounts owed to us from vendors as a result of changes in some of our contractual purchase arrangements  the timing of payments from pharmacy benefit services customers and increased pharmacy receivables arising from higher sales 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures for new stores  store remodels and improvements  equipment  technology and supply chain improvements  including the construction of a new front end distribution center  partially offset by cash receipts from property dispositions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures include amounts invested to date for the construction of our new front end distribution center in patterson  california 
the lower level of capital expenditures in fiscal was partially due to the timing of expenditures for certain projects approved in fiscal  which carried over into fiscal fiscal capital expenditures also included investments in store pharmacy robotics and digital photography technology 
cash receipts from property dispositions were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal receipts include net proceeds of approximately million from the sale leaseback of our lathrop front end distribution center  which we plan to vacate when our new patterson distribution center  currently under construction  is fully operational 
the remainder of our cash receipts from property distributions in fiscal  and primarily include the sale of company owned locations as a result of closing stores and support facilities 
we opened new stores in fiscal  opened new stores and relocated stores in fiscal  and opened new stores and relocated one store in fiscal we also remodeled stores during fiscal  stores during fiscal and stores during fiscal we plan to open or relocate approximately to stores and remodel up to stores in fiscal we are also constructing a new front end distribution center in patterson  california  scheduled for completion in the summer of fiscal we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be between million and million 
the increase over fiscal is primarily due to costs associated with the patterson distribution center  increased new store growth and the timing of expenditures for certain projects approved in fiscal  which will carry over into fiscal in addition  in the ordinary course of business we may acquire stores  store related assets including pharmacy customer lists  or other complementary businesses 
financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our financing activities primarily consist of long term borrowings and repayments  repurchases of common stock  dividend payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our borrowing levels on our revolving line of credit fluctuate based largely on the levels of our cash flows from operations  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
we reduced our revolving line of credit borrowings by million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and in fiscal  we increased our revolving line of credit borrowings by million 
as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
we also made regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes of 
table of contents million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we are scheduled to make additional principal payments of million on our private placement notes in fiscal we have repurchased shares of our outstanding common stock in each of the last three years  as follows fiscal year shares repurchased total cost millions we repurchased these shares under various programs authorized by our board of directors  most recently in may under the may share repurchase program  we are authorized to repurchase additional shares of our outstanding common stock for a maximum additional expenditure of million 
any future repurchase of our common stock will depend on existing market conditions  our financial position  and other capital requirements 
proceeds from employee stock option exercises were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increased level of stock option exercises reflects an increasing number of vested options and a higher average stock price 
our board of directors makes decisions about the declaration of quarterly dividends based on  among other things  our results of operations and financial position 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends of per share per share annually for each of the last three fiscal years 
total dividends were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years thousands long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total see debt  leases and commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the above items 
purchase obligations include merchandise purchase commitments under various long term supply contracts  as well as outstanding commitments under purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
purchase obligations include estimated amounts to purchase pharmaceutical inventories from amerisourcebergen  our primary supplier  under a long term contract  including a new contract that will take effect in july upon expiration of the current contract 
the contract includes a minimum purchase requirement over the contract term  which is effective for three to seven years depending on our actual purchase levels and various termination provisions 
the amounts included for this contract in the above table represent our best estimate of purchase levels under the contract s terms 
our other long term liabilities of million as of january  consisted of deferred tax liabilities  deferred rent  capital lease obligations  and store closure reserves 
these items either are not of a contractual 
table of contents nature  such as deferred rent and deferred income taxes  or are included elsewhere in the above table  such as capital and closed store lease obligations 
we incur substantial cash requirements for the payment of interest and income taxes each year 
payments for interest fluctuate based on our borrowings and interest rates 
our cash payments for interest  net of amounts capitalized  were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at january   all of our million in outstanding debt bears interest at fixed rates 
scheduled interest payments on fixed interest long term debt are included in long term debt in the table above 
our unsecured revolving line of credit  on which no borrowings were outstanding as of january   bears interest at libor based rates 
our cash payments for income taxes were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal payments for income taxes fluctuate based on our taxable income and the availability and timing of tax deductions and credits 
we also incur obligations for contributions to our employee savings and profit sharing plan 
we match a portion of our employees voluntary contributions and provide profit sharing contributions to the plan in some years 
our contributions to the plan  which may be made in cash or in shares of our common stock  fluctuate based on the level of participation in the plan by our employees as well as our levels of income 
our contributions to this plan were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal  all of which we funded with shares of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not make use of any off balance sheet arrangements that currently have or that we expect are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we utilize operating leases for many of our store locations  and from time to time we engage in sale leaseback arrangements for financing purposes 
we do not use special purpose entities in any of our leasing arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements  and actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and reserves our receivables primarily include amounts due from third party providers eg  pharmacy benefit managers  insurance companies and governmental agencies and vendors 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables that we estimate to be uncollectible 
our estimates of uncollectible amounts are based on our historical collection experience  current economic and credit conditions and any information available to us indicating that specific accounts are unlikely to be collected 
we have historically collected a relatively high percentage of our accounts receivable  especially pharmacy receivables  and our credit and collection losses have not materially adversely affected us 
however  if the financial condition of our third party providers or vendors deteriorates  we may increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts and our recovery of recorded receivables may be significantly affected 

table of contents merchandise inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if we do not sell the merchandise at expected prices or if we make decisions to significantly reduce or eliminate merchandise items or categories  we may need to record adjustments to the carrying value of our merchandise inventories and our realization of recorded inventories may be significantly affected 
we use the last in  first out lifo method to determine inventory cost 
the calculation of lifo inventory costs depends on a number of factors  including annual inflation rates  year end inventory levels and merchandise mix  which require estimates during interim periods 
these estimates are subject to substantial variability and may result in significant adjustments  particularly during the fourth quarter  when final inflation rates and inventory levels and mix are determined 
our lifo provision  included in cost of goods sold  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
we perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth fiscal quarter  when updated financial projections are available 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate store specific long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or segment level as appropriate 
we evaluate goodwill at a reporting unit level in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
geographic regional divisions within the retail drug store segment comprise our reporting units 
since quoted market prices are not typically available for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values for most assets based on the expected present value of future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes

an independent actuary periodically evaluates our most significant insurance reserves 
we discount reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims to their expected present value using an essentially risk free interest rate 
the projections involved in this estimate are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation and interest rates
