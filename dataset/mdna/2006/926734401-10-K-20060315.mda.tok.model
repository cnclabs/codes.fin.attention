reconciliation of non gaap financial measures this section includes certain performance measures that may be considered non gaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations 
management believes that these financial measures provide investors and analysts useful additional insight into our company s financial position and performance 
management also uses these financial measures to evaluate the company s performance and to make certain decisions relating to the optimal allocation of our resources 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered substitutes for performance measures presented in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we caution that the methodologies for the calculation of non gaap financial measures may vary from company to company and  therefore  non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named non gaap financial measures reported by other companies 
the tables below reconcile in thousands the following financial measures included  in this section that may be considered non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap adjusted operating income and adjusted net income 
year ended december  quarter ended december  gaap operating income loss less amortization of acquired technology purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges business restructuring benefit charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets adjusted operating income loss

total revenue for fiscal year was million or an increase of over the fiscal year revenue of million 
in addition  the company increased liquidity with an increase in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million to a total of million at december  versus million at december  the company continues to carry no long term debt 
the improved performance in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of many factors 
we grew our software license and services revenue during while continuing to focus on cost control and efficiency in our business 
during the year  we reduced both our total costs of revenue and our operating expenses 
the largest contributor in the decrease in operating expenses was a reduction in costs as a result of the business restructuring that occurred in fiscal the company also exited most of its portfolio of equity investments resulting in gains of approximately license revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and  respectively  as compared to maintenance revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up for the year and down for the fourth quarter as compared to professional services revenues of million in fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of were up and as compared to international revenue comprised and of total revenue for the year and quarter ended december   respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our annual or quarterly revenues 
the gross profit margin in fiscal increased five points to versus in fiscal the costs of revenue associated with product licenses decreased by million to million from million 
on a percentage 
table of contents basis product license direct costs were of total revenues in fiscal versus of total revenues in fiscal led to an improvement in the gross profit margin of point 
this was primarily due to a reduction in the costs of embedded technology 
the amortization of acquired technology decreased to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal on a percentage basis amortization of acquired technology was of total revenue in fiscal versus of total revenue in fiscal the decrease in the amortization of acquired technology lead to an improvement of in the gross profit margin 
the decrease in the amortization of acquired technology is related to the normal run out of costs associated with recent acquisitions 
the costs of professional services increased to million from million 
as a percent of total revenue the costs of services was of total revenue in fiscal versus of total revenue in fiscal which lead to an improvement in the gross profit margin of 
the increase in absolute dollars related to the cost of services is due to the increased sales volume of services to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total expenses  including both cost of revenue and operating expenses  for fiscal and for the fourth quarter of were million and million  respectively  and included million and million  respectively  for the following benefits charges business restructuring benefits  acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and intangibles and the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
most of these benefits charges relate to our previous acquisitions 
the business restructuring benefits of million are primarily the result of the sublease of idle facilities 
the remaining expenses of million for fiscal and million for the fourth quarter of were down and as compared to due to lower costs of revenue as discussed above and lower operating expenses as a result of the business restructuring that occurred in in the fourth quarter of  the company had operating income of million as compared to an operating loss of million for the fourth quarter of the increase was largely due to a decrease in the restructuring charges 
the decrease is a result of lower than expected costs particularly reduced facilities charges as the company has been successful in subleasing excess space and certain leases expired 
the company recorded a small restructuring benefit in the fourth quarter of ten thousand dollars versus restructuring charges of million for the same quarter in the combination of revenue growth and our continued cost control efforts yielded non gaap profit from operations of million during the fourth quarter of  excluding the million in charges described above 
this compares to a profit of million during the fourth quarter of the company reported increases in fiscal versus fiscal on a gaap basis in total revenue  gross profit margin  income from operations  other income  and net income 
the increase in sales combined with lower operating costs plus gains on the sale of equity investments allowed the company to produce net income of million in fiscal as compared to a net loss of million during fiscal excluding a net charge of million as described above and gains for the sale of certain equity investments totaling million  non gaap net income for fiscal was million 
this compares to non gaap net loss of million in fiscal in the company continued to execute the restructuring plan put in place in and expanded in fiscal years   and that included the expiration or sublease of office space no longer used by the company 
the company realized restructuring benefits in of million due primarily to the sublease of these idle facilities 
the company continued to offshore operations to control costs and improve efficiency 
headcount was employees at december  as compared to employees at december  these and other actions have contributed to an increase in operating income on a gaap basis of million for fiscal year versus an operating loss of million for fiscal our total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balance totaled approximately million as of december   and increased approximately million from december   due to the improved operating results and the gains on the sale of certain equity investments

the primary risk to achieving our goals is competitive pressure  particularly from larger companies with much longer operating histories and greater resources 
moreover  many of these companies can adopt aggressive pricing policies and provide customers with consolidated offerings that may include some of our product capabilities 
other key risks include market acceptance of our products  the overall level of information technology spending  the uncertainties and challenges of offshore outsourcing and our ability to maintain control over expenses and cash 
our prospects must be considered in light of these risks  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and 
table of contents related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of product license and services fees 
product license fee income is earned through licensing the right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  consulting services and training services 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable  and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation of the product  we evaluate whether delivery has occurred upon shipment of software or upon completion of services and if the customer payment is probable of collection 
this evaluation is made based on various factors such as the nature of the services work  order type eg initial vs 
follow on  customer s payment history  etc 
in the instances where delivery is deemed not to have occurred upon shipment based on the aforementioned factors  license revenue is taken when we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to the implementation 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed as they are not essential to the functionality of our products 

table of contents deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing such  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
business restructuring 
we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in  and we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our real estate portfolio and may vacate or occupy other leased space as dictated by our analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year and during an interim period if facts or circumstances would more likely than not suggest that the fair value of an identified reporting unit is below its carrying value 
there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets in   or results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenue product license services total revenue cost of revenue product license amortization of acquired technology services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges business restructuring benefits charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended december   and in thousands  unless otherwise noted revenue year ended december  compared to compared to product license maintenance and support professional services total services revenue total revenue total revenue increased in and in the increase in revenue in is due to several factors 
the company continues to make strides in product integration and stability 
this includes the expansion and ongoing integration of products through our tower technology acquisition in the first quarter of which added software and services capabilities and an increase in revenues 
the company also continued to simplify and amplify the message that the company provides solutions for customers 
lastly  there was renewed interest in enterprise content management software during fiscal year the increase in revenue for was due to sales associated with the collaboration and document management products acquired in december and march  respectively  as partially offset by the continued weakness in the software industry and the ramp up time required to successfully integrate our recently acquired companies 

product license 
product license revenue increased in and in the increase in can be attributed to an improving market for enterprise content software  the continued integration of the products discussed below  and a focused marketing and sales strategy on industry segments such as healthcare 
the increase in can be attributed primarily to sales of collaboration and document management products acquired in our december and march acquisitions  respectively 
services 
services revenue increased in and in the increase in professional services in is due to the larger install base of vignette s software products and professional services sold in conjunction with new product licenses 
the increase in maintenance and support as well as professional services revenue in is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of intraspect and tower technology 
during  and  no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
international revenue was million  million and million  or   and of total revenues  in   and  respectively 

table of contents gross profit cost of revenue consists of costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  the costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products  the amortization of certain acquired technology  and personnel and other expenses related to providing professional and maintenance services 
gross profit amounts and percentages are as follows year ended december  compared to compared to product license amortization of acquired technology maintenance and support professional services total services total gross profit as a percent of sales  gross profit represented   and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in is due to improved margins on product licenses and lower amortization charges of acquired technology 
the improvement in the gross profit margin for product license increased in concert with the growth in revenue and by the lower costs of imbedded software 
the decline in the amortization of acquired technology in is due to the normal run out of those amortized costs 
the decline in gross profit in compared to is primarily due to the amortization of acquired technology related to our intraspect and tower technology acquisitions  the lower mix of license revenue as well as higher costs of supporting our expanded product offerings 
operating expenses year ended december  compared to compared to research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges business restructuring benefits charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expenses decreased in and increased in the year over year decrease in is due primarily to our restructuring efforts via reduced engineering headcount in the first half of  lower facilities expenses and other cost saving measures such as the consolidation of product development facilities and the transition of these activities to an offshore operations model 
the year over year increase in in absolute dollars relates to the timing of research and development efforts and the ramp up of certain offshore development activities  partially offset by other cost savings 

table of contents the company did not capitalize any software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company did capitalize costs that related to software developed by third a party that was not acquired in a business combination prior to those costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  generally months 
amortization expense was million  million  and million in  and  respectively  and is included in cost of revenue product license on the consolidated statements of operations 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales  marketing and customer care personnel  sales commissions  public relations  marketing materials and tradeshows as well as bad debt charges 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease in is attributable to reduced bad debt charges and lower marketing and headcount costs 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is attributable to increased commission expense and other variable costs resulting from higher product sales in as well as bad debt charges incurred primarily during the first quarter of the increase was partially offset by lower marketing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for human resources  finance  accounting  facilities  information technology and legal employees 
general and administrative expenses increased in and in the increase in absolute dollars for and is attributable to the increased costs of meeting regulatory reporting requirements 
purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges 
during fiscal the company recognized expense associated with business combinations 
the company made a series of complimentary businesses acquisitions in the three years ended december  the following table summarizes costs related to our business combinations in thousands for the most recent three years year ended december  purchased in process research and development cross training  product integration and other severance and other employee related costs contingent compensation included in the acquired net assets of tower technology was purchased in process research and development ipr d efforts that we intended to substantially rework before integrating into our products in thousands acquired company acquired ipr d project description estimated fair value current status at december  tower technology tower idm collaborative document management functionality with process automation solutions and decentralization of configuration 
 application from this project is now fully integrated into our products 
tower seraph provides document review workflows  case management and section compliance the amounts allocated to ipr d were based on discounted cash flow models that employed cash flow projections for revenue based on the projected incremental increase in revenue that the acquired company expected to receive from the completed ipr d 
such assumptions were based on management s estimates and the growth potential of the market 
revenue for the projection periods assumed a compound 
table of contents annual growth rate of  and was adjusted to reflect the percentage of research and development determined to be complete as of the acquisition date 
cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense were estimated as a percent of revenue based on the acquired company s historical results and industry averages 
these estimated operating expenses as well as capital charges and applicable income taxes were deducted to arrive at an estimated after tax cash flow 
the after tax cash flow projections were discounted using a risk adjusted rate of return  of to 
these discount rates were based on the acquired company s weighted average cost of capital of  as adjusted upwards for the additional risk related to the projects development and success 
the resulting ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the efforts required to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that would be necessary to establish that the products could be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the timing for the completion of such efforts was expected to range between twelve and eighteen months 
further  we were uncertain of our ability to complete the products within a timeframe acceptable to the market and ahead of competitors 
the application of the purchased ipr d has now been incorporated into the company s product set 
impairment of intangible assets 
we use a two step approach to assess our goodwill annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
in step of the assessment the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if an impairment of goodwill is indicated 
the estimated fair value is based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis 
if no impairment is indicated in step no additional analysis is performed 
should an impairment be indicated the company would measure the loss in step by comparing the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the amount of impairment loss to be recorded 
we also review other intangible assets for possible impairment periodically 
sustained negative industry and economic trends  a decline in our stock price and market capitalization for an extended period of time  or changes in our product offerings could result in future impairment charges that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
based on the methods described above there were no impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets in   or business restructuring charges 
in  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
in   and  we expanded those restructuring efforts 
although we have substantially implemented our restructuring activities  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
components of business restructuring charges and the remaining restructuring accruals as of december  are as follows in thousands 
table of contents facility lease commitments asset impairments employee separation and other costs total balance at december  total restructuring charge cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion remaining cash expenditures resulting from the restructuring are estimated to be million and relate primarily to facility lease commitments  of which the remaining maximum lease commitment extends out to we have substantially implemented our restructuring efforts initiated in conjunction with this restructuring plan  however  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
these are management s best estimates based on currently available information and are subject to change 
consolidation of excess facilities facility lease commitments relate to lease obligations for excess office space that the company has vacated as a result of the restructuring plan 
the company continues to actively pursue mitigation strategies to dispose of all excess office space through subleasing and or early termination negotiations where possible 
the total lease commitments include the estimated lease buyout fees  or the remaining lease liabilities and estimated associated mitigation costs including  but not limited to  brokerage commissions  legal fees  repairs  restoration costs  and sublease incentives  offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and any resulting sublease income  were based on market information and trend analysis as estimated by the company 
the company continually assesses its real estate portfolio and may vacate and or occupy other leased space as dictated by its analysis and by the needs of the business 
it is reasonably possible that actual results could continue to differ from these estimates in the near term  and such differences could be material to the financial statements 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities 
table of contents might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate the company s accrual for facility lease commitments 
the accrual adjustments recorded during fiscal relate primarily to such differences  namely the buyout fees and sublease income of certain vacated properties were more favorable than we had anticipated 
facility lease commitments relate to the company s departure from certain office space in austin  texas  brisbane and san francisco  california  new york city  new york  waltham and boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  slough  united kingdom  and madrid  spain 
the maximum lease commitment of such vacated properties extends through december asset impairments asset impairments relate to the impairment of certain fixed assets  prepaid royalties and intangible assets 
these fixed assets were impaired as a result of the company s decision to vacate certain office space and align its infrastructure with current and projected headcount 
employee separation and other costs employee separation and other costs include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other restructuring charges 
as a result of the restructuring activities  the company severed approximately  employees 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring efforts include personnel in positions throughout the sales  marketing  professional services  engineering and general and administrative functions in all geographies 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for stock options issued to employees  we record deferred compensation at the grant date if a difference exists between the exercise price and the market value of our common stock 
for restricted share issuances  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value on the issue date 
deferred stock compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the applicable options and restricted share grants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to the following cost categories in thousands year ended december  research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets 
intangible amortization expense decreased in as compared to and increased in compared to the decrease in compared to relates to the decline in amortization expense for assets assumed from the intraspect and tower technology acquisitions as the remaining unamortized cost continues to decline 
the increase in amortization expense in compared to is related to those same assets as tower technology was acquired on march  and intraspect on december  therefore  fiscal year bore a greater portion of the amortization expense due to the timing of the acquisitions 
amortization expense for these assets is recorded ratably over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets  which range from two to six years other income and expense other income and expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  recognized investment gains and losses as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
year ended december  compared to compared to interest income and other  net gain on sale of equity investments 
table of contents other income and expense  net increased in due to higher cash and short term investment balances and increasing yields on invested funds 
the gain on the sale of equity investments was due to the sale of equity securities in privately held technology companies 
the largest of which was a sale of shopzilla for approximately million to ew scripps company 
the company owned approximately of shopzilla and recognized a gain of approximately million 
the company had no carrying cost in the asset at the time of the sale due to previous impairment charges 
the decrease in compared to is primarily due to lower cash balances available for investment  a decrease in interest rates earned on those cash balances  and foreign exchange gains recognized in but minimized in with the implementation of a hedge program 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a foreign exchange policy to reduce our exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
at december   our unrestricted  long term investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an investee could require future impairment charges 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which includes net operating loss  net foreign operating loss  capital loss  and research tax credit carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
quarterly results the table on pages f to f of the consolidated financial statements section sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data  both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue  for each of the last consecutive eight quarters 
we base our forecast for expenses in part on future as opposed to historical revenue projections due to the continued changes in our business 
many of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of customer demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including demand for our products and services  the timing of sales of our products and services  
table of contents the timing of customer orders and product implementations  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web based applications  the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  global events  including terrorist activities and military operations  and the general economic climate  changes to our licensing and pricing model 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   the company had federal net operating loss  capital loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss  capital loss  and research credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts  between and  if not utilized 
the company also had a foreign net operating loss carryover of approximately million 
the foreign net operating loss carryover is not subject to expiration 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss  capital loss  and research credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
at december  approximately million of the net operating loss  million of the net foreign operating loss  and million of the research credit carryover were incurred by companies we acquired and will be subject to an annual limitation 
in addition  the remaining net operating loss of million  capital loss carryforward of million  and research credit carryover of million may be subject to this limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the benefit of these tax attributes in future periods 
as a result  substantial amounts of the company s net operating loss  capital loss  and research credit carryforwards may expire prior to utilization 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating losses carried forward  research and development carryforwards  and capital loss carryforwards because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance includes approximately million related to the acquisition of epicentric  intraspect and tower technology net deferred tax assets 
the initial recognition of these acquired deferred tax asset items will first reduce goodwill  then other non current intangible assets of the acquired entity 
in both years ended december  and the company recognized approximately million of acquired deferred tax assets as a reduction to goodwill 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward  substantially all of which when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to deferred compensation expense

recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued a statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
sfas r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that the company currently uses and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the effective date of the new standard is for fiscal years beginning after june   which for the company will be the first quarter of fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas r 
this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas r and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab in connection with our adoption of sfas r 
we plan to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the previous requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
upon adoption of sfas r  we plan to use the black scholes model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
we expect this standard to have a significant impact on the consolidated statements of operations 
the current expected range of expense for the first quarter of is thousand to million 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as cash flow from financing activities rather than as cash flow from operations as required under sfas the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas r in relation to the statements of cash flows relative to any excess tax benefits that may be generated
