item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview the company operates on a global basis providing multi line reinsurance to insurance companies 
the company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide  and differentiates itself through its approach to risk  its strategy to manage risk  and its financial strength 
reinsurance is by its nature a risk assumption business 
the company s philosophy is to assume its clients risks  thereby removing their volatility associated with these risks  and then manage those risks and risk related volatility 
the company s ability to succeed in the risk assumption business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk  to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate  and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and absolute limits for the risks assumed 
the reinsurance markets have historically been highly cyclical in nature 
the cycle is driven by competition  the amount of capital and capacity in the industry  loss events  and investment returns 
the company s long term strategy to generate shareholder value focuses on broad product and geographic diversification of risks  assuming a moderately greater degree of risk than the market average  managing its capital across its risk portfolio and over the duration of the cycle  transactional excellence  and utilizing internal financial capabilities to achieve superior returns on capital 
the company was first established in as a specialty catastrophe reinsurer 
recognizing the limitations and inherent volatility in writing a single line of business  the company made a strategic shift to diversify its risk portfolio 
the company began pursuing acquisition opportunities  and in acquired french reinsurer safr subsequently renamed partner re sa  and then the following year acquired the reinsurance operations of the winterthur group 
through these acquisitions and organic growth  the company has evolved into a leading multi line reinsurer 
the company writes business from four principal locations bermuda  greenwich connecticut  zurich and paris 
risks reinsured include property  casualty  motor  agriculture  aviation space  catastrophe  credit surety  engineering energy  marine  special risk  life annuity and health  and alternative risk transfer solutions 
through its broad product and geographic diversification  its excellent execution capabilities  and its local presence in most major markets  the company is able to respond quickly to market needs  and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world 
today  the company has more than employees and does business in countries around the world 
the company writes business through its wholly owned subsidiaries partner reinsurance company ltd 
partner reinsurance  partnerre sa  and partner reinsurance company of the us the company reports on three operating segments non life  which comprises its traditional property and casualty business in the us us p c sub segment and the rest of the world global non us p c sub segment and its significant specialty lines business worldwide specialty sub segment  life  and alternative risk transfer art 
each segment has its own business units  which are aligned either by market  line of business  or client buying patterns 
the company generates its revenue primarily from premiums 
premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions 
pricing cycles are driven by supply and demand  and the amount of capital in the industry 
the reinsurance business is also influenced by several other factors including variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments  loss trends  inflation and general economic conditions 
throughout the late s  the industry s operating profitability and cash flows declined as a result of declining prices  a deterioration in terms and conditions and increasing loss costs 
these negative trends were  however  offset by high investment returns that led to continued growth in capital 
premium rates began to increase in  when the large loss events of that year  including the september tragedy and the enron bankruptcy  in addition to steep declines in interest rates and equity values  added to the pressure for improvements in pricing and underwriting conditions 
in january through the middle of  the company experienced the strongest renewal seasons in over five years 
in the second half of  the company began to see a flattening in the rate of improvements in the terms and conditions of the most profitable lines and a slower rate of improvement in those lines that had not yet reached their peak in terms of profitability 
from the middle of to the end of  this resulted in a slower growth rate in pricing  although there was good pricing discipline in the industry 
during  pricing was generally flat to down  except for those lines specifically affected by large losses in this led to a reduction in premiums written by the company in however  the year eventually developed into the worst year in the history of the industry in terms of catastrophe losses  with hurricane katrina  which devastated the gulf coast in late august  being the largest insured event ever 
the catastrophic events of  which included two other significant atlantic 
table of contents hurricanes  rita and wilma  as well as a significant winterstorm and a flood in europe  came on the back of an unusually active atlantic hurricane season in consequently  during the january  renewals  the company observed strong pricing increases in those lines and geographies that incurred the largest losses in  including catastrophe covers in the southeastern us and in the us property and energy lines 
pricing in other lines was generally stable 
the company experienced a generally healthy reinsurance market at january   and while results were varied by line and geographic market  the company maintained profitability on business renewed 
overall  there was a significant increase in the amount of risk that was retained by cedants  as well as a trend by cedants to restructure quota share coverages into excess of loss treaties  thereby reducing the overall amount of premiums in the reinsurance marketplace 
nevertheless  the company wrote a considerable amount of new business 
the company has not changed its strategy or approach to business during the changes in market conditions 
the company continues to be opportunistic in writing business in its property  casualty and specialty lines  while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio and maintaining its focus on growth in its life and art business segments 
a key challenge facing the company is to successfully manage through the less profitable portion of the reinsurance cycle 
the company is confident in its long term strategy  and believes that by closely monitoring the progression of each line of business  being selective in the business that it writes  and maintaining the diversification and balance of its portfolio  it will continue to optimize returns 
individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time 
management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product  geography  line and type of business  length of tail  and distribution channel  and that this diversification  in addition to the financial strength of the company  and its strong global franchise  will help to mitigate cyclical declines in underwriting profitability 
the company also generates revenue from its substantial and high quality investment portfolio 
the company follows prudent investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the company s overall objectives of earnings stability and long term book value growth 
liability funds are used to support the company s net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s reinsurance liabilities net of reinsurance assets  and are matched in size  currency and duration with existing liabilities in the company s underwriting portfolio 
the company invests the liability funds in high quality fixed income securities with the primary objective of preserving liquidity and protecting capital 
capital funds are invested to achieve total returns that enhance growth in shareholders equity and are invested in investment grade and below investment grade fixed income securities and equity instruments 
the company is mindful of achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns that include price appreciation in changing market conditions 
the company regularly reviews the allocation of investments to asset classes within its investment portfolio and reallocates investments to those asset classes the company anticipates will outperform in the near future  subject to limits and guidelines 
the company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed income portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates  or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes  depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions 
in addition to revenues generated from its underwriting operations and investment activities  the company s profitability is significantly affected by the level of its losses and loss expenses incurred 
the company recognizes losses and loss expenses on the basis of actual and expected claims on business written 
the company s non life net reserve position at december  was billion 
management believes that it follows prudent reserving policies in pursuit of a strong financial position 
a key challenge for the company consists of estimating loss reserves accurately for each line of business  which is critical to accurately determine the profitability of each line and allocate the optimal amount of capital to each line 
the risk for the company consists in allocating too much of its capital to one or more lines of business that are less profitable than anticipated  and not enough capital to those lines of business that eventually prove to be more profitable 
another key success factor lies in achieving proper diversification in the book of business  such that the company achieves a more balanced return over time 
key financial measures in addition to the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income  management uses four key financial measures to evaluate its underwriting performance as well as the overall growth in value generated for the company s common shareholders 
book value per share management uses book value growth as a prime measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s book value ultimately translates into growth of the company s stock price 
book value per share is calculated using common shareholders equity divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding 
since december   the company has generated a compound annual growth rate in book value per share in excess of  including when the company s book value per share declined by as a result of the significant catastrophic events of the year 
book value is impacted by the company s net income and external factors such as interest rates  which can drive changes in unrealized gains or losses on its investment portfolio 

table of contents dividend policy management considers its dividend policy an integral part of the value creation process for the company s common shareholders  as growth in common shareholder value is comprised of growth in both the book value per share as well as dividends paid 
management reviews the company s dividend policy regularly with the board of directors and the board has increased the annual dividend each year since the company s inception 
roe management uses operating return on beginning shareholders equity roe  a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders 
it is calculated using net operating loss earnings available to common shareholders net loss income less after tax net realized gains losses on investments and preferred share dividends divided by beginning common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the liquidation value of preferred shares 
management has set a minimum roe target over the reinsurance cycle  which management believes provides an attractive return to shareholders 
each business unit and support department throughout the company is focused on seeking to ensure that the company meets the return objective 
this means that most economic decisions  including capital allocation and underwriting pricing decisions  incorporate an roe impact analysis 
for the purpose of this analysis  an appropriate amount of capital equity is allocated to each transaction for determining the transaction s roe 
subject to an adequate return for the risk level as well as other factors  such as the contribution of each risk to the overall risk level and risk diversification  capital is allocated to the transactions generating the highest roe 
management s challenge consists of i allocating an appropriate amount of capital to each transaction based on the incremental risk created by the transaction  ii properly estimating the company s overall risk level and the impact of each transaction to the overall risk level  and iii assessing the diversification benefit  if any  of each transaction 
the risk for the company lies in mis estimating any one of these factors  which are critical in calculating a meaningful roe  and entering into transactions that do contribute to the company s roe objective 
combined ratio the combined ratio is used industry wide as a measure of underwriting profitability in the non life business 
the combined ratio is the sum of the technical ratio losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned and the other operating expense ratio other operating expenses divided by net premiums earned 
a combined ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  as the total losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and other operating expenses are less than the premiums earned on that business 
since  the company has had three years of underwriting profitability reflected in combined ratios of less than for its non life segment 
in  the company recorded a net underwriting loss as a result of significant catastrophic events during the year and this is reflected in the company s non life combined ratio of 
the key challenge for maintaining a profitable combined ratio consists of i focusing on underwriting profitable business even in the weaker part of the reinsurance cycle  as opposed to growing the book of business at the cost of profitability  ii diversifying the portfolio  to achieve a good balance of business  with the expectation that underwriting losses in certain lines or markets may potentially be offset by underwriting profits in other lines and markets  and iii maintaining control over expenses 
other key issues of management enterprise culture management is focused on ensuring that the structure and culture of the organization promote intelligent  prudent  transparent and ethical decision making 
management believes that a sound enterprise culture starts with the tone at the top 
the executive management holds regular company wide information sessions to present and review management s latest decisions  whether operational  financial or structural  as well as the financial results for the company 
employees are encouraged to address questions related to the company s results  strategy or management decisions  either anonymously or otherwise to management so that they can be answered during these information sessions 
management believes that these sessions provide a consistent message to all employees about the company s value of transparency 
managements also strives to promote a work environment that i aligns the skill set of individuals with challenges encountered by the company  ii includes segregation of duties to ensure objectivity in decision making  and iii provides a compensation structure that encourages and rewards intelligent and ethical behavior 
to that effect  the company has a written code of business conduct and ethics and provides employees with a direct communication channel to the audit committee in the event they become aware of questionable behavior of management or anyone else 
finally  management believes that building a sound control environment  including a strong internal audit function  helps ensure that behaviors are consistent with the company s cultural values 

table of contents risk management a key challenge in the reinsurance industry is to create economic value though the intelligent assumption of reinsurance and investment risk  on the one hand  but also to limit or mitigate those risks that can destroy tangible as well as intangible value 
management takes an integrated view of risk management  and the company s risk management framework encompasses strategic risks  reinsurance risks  and operational risks 
the company believes that it is not desirable to manage any of these risks in isolation 
there are many interrelationships and correlations between risks and  therefore  each risk is viewed in the context of the entire company 
the organizational structure at partnerre is designed with a significant emphasis on the effective and efficient management of the company s risks 
strategic risks and key risk limits are the responsibility of the executive management and the board of directors board 
the company s assumed risks are managed by individual business units  subject to the limits and policies established by the executive management and the board 
operational risks are managed by designated functions within the organization 
various controls and monitoring processes throughout the organization are designed to ensure that management and the board have a good understanding of the company s risks and related mitigation strategies 
capital adequacy a key challenge for management is to maintain an appropriate level of capital 
management s first priority is to hold sufficient capital to meet all of the company s obligations to cedants  meet regulatory requirements  and support its position as one of the stronger reinsurers in the industry 
holding an excessive amount of capital  however  will reduce the company s roe 
consequently  management closely monitors its capital needs and capital level throughout the cycle  and actively takes steps to increase or decrease the company s capital in order to achieve the proper balance of financial strength and shareholder returns 
capital management is achieved by either deploying capital to fund attractive business opportunities  or in times of excess capital  returning capital to shareholders by way of share repurchases and dividends 
liquidity and cash flows the company aims to be a reliable and financially secure partner to its cedants 
this means that the company must maintain sufficient liquidity at all times so that it can support cedants by settling claims quickly 
the company generates cash flows primarily from its underwriting and investment operations 
management believes that a profitable  well run reinsurance organization will generate sufficient cash from premium receipts to pay claims  acquisition costs and operating expenses in most years 
to the extent that underwriting cash flows are not sufficient to cover operating outflows in any year  the company will utilize cash flows generated from investments and may ultimately liquidate assets from its investment portfolio 
management ensures that its liquidity requirements are supported by maintaining a high quality  well balanced and liquid portfolio and by matching the duration of its investment portfolio with that of its net reinsurance liabilities 
for the past three years  the company has generated over billion per year in operating cash flows from both its underwriting and investment operations 
in  the company expects there will be pressure on cash flows as a result of the significant expected claims payouts from the catastrophic events 
notwithstanding this  the company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows in management also maintains credit facilities with banks that would procure efficient access to cash in the event of an unforeseen cash requirement 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  including note  significant accounting policies  for a full understanding of the company s accounting policies 
losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company the primary company or the cedant  the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company the reinsurer and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer  the company s liability for unpaid 
table of contents losses and loss expenses loss reserves is based largely upon estimates 
the company categorizes loss reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  additional case reserves acrs and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
acrs are established for particular circumstances where  on the basis of individual loss reports  the company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves and acrs 
unlike case reserves and acrs  ibnr reserves are generally calculated in the aggregate for each line of business and they cannot usually be identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
the company also estimates the future unallocated loss adjustment expenses associated with the loss reserves ulae and these form part of the company s loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company s non life loss reserves for each category and sub segment are reported in the table included later in this section 
the amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail 
lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines  and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long tail lines 
in general  for reinsurance  the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer s 
the delay varies by reinsurance market country of cedant  type of treaty  whether losses are paid by the cedant and the size of the loss 
the delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer 
for both short and long tail lines  the company s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses 
total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid 
similarly  ibnr reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and acrs from total loss reserves 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells 
the losses on each treaty for every underwriting year are assigned to a reserving cell 
an underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred accident year  or the calendar year for which financial results are reported 
the reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics eg reporting tail but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible 
the selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the company evolves 
for each reserving cell  the company s estimates of loss reserves are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies 
in selecting its best estimate  the company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid loss development methods  incurred loss development methods  paid borhuetter ferguson b f methods  incurred b f methods  loss ratio methods and bektander methods 
in addition  the company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims 
for example  internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer 
in the case of asbestos and environmental claims  the company has established reserves for future loss and allocated loss expenses based on the results of periodic actuarial studies  which consider the underlying exposures of the company s cedants 
the reserve methodologies employed by the company are dependent on data that the company collects 
this data consists primarily of loss amounts reported by the company s cedants  loss payments made by the company s cedants  and premiums written and earned reported by the cedants or estimated by the company 
the actuarial methods used by the company to project its liabilities recorded today but that will be paid in the future future liabilities do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported  claim counts settled or claim counts open because  due to the nature of the company s business  this information is not routinely provided by the cedants for every treaty 
consequently  actuarial methods relying on this information cannot be used by the company to estimate loss reserves 
the company examines loss development trends by underwriting year to determine various assumptions that are required as inputs in the actuarial methodologies it employs 
this typically involves the analysis of historical loss development trends by reserving cell and by underwriting year  and the calculation of long term averages 
in addition  the company utilizes external or internal benchmark sources of information for the reserving cells for which the company does not have sufficient loss development data to calculate credible trends 

table of contents several underlying assumptions are used in the construction of average trends and their subsequent use in the actuarial methodologies we employ 
the validity of these underlying assumptions is reviewed periodically and if appropriate  modifications are made in the selection of average trends or other reserving inputs to reflect deviations from the underlying assumptions 
critical underlying assumptions are i the cedant s business practices will proceed as in the past with no material changes either in submission of accounts or cash flows  ii any internal delays in processing accounts received by the cedant are not materially different from that experienced historically  and hence the implicit reserving allowance made in loss reserves through our methods continues to be appropriate  iii case reserve reporting practices  particularly the methodologies used to establish and report case reserves  are unchanged from historical practices  iv the company s internal claim practices  particularly the level and extent of use of acrs are unchanged  v historical levels of claim inflation can be projected into the future and will have no material effect on either the acceleration or deceleration of claim reporting and payment patterns  vi the selection of reserving cells results in homogeneous and credible future expectations for all business in the cell and any changes in underlying treaty terms are either reflected in cell selection or explicitly allowed in the selection of trends  vii in cases where benchmarks are used  they are derived from the experience of similar business  and viii the company can form a credible initial expectation of the ultimate loss ratio of recent underwriting years through a review of pricing information supplemented by qualitative information on market events 
in general  the estimates of loss reserves recorded for short tail business are subject to less volatility than those for long tail lines 
carried loss reserves for the us p c sub segment are considered to be predominantly long tail due to the significant volume of us casualty business written in this sub segment 
the casualty line comprised of the net premiums written for this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in the remaining business within this sub segment  motor and property  is considered to be short tail 
within the global non us p c sub segment  the company considers both its casualty business as well as its non proportional motor business to be long tail 
these two lines represented of the net premiums written in the global non us p c sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in management considers the short tail lines within the global non us p c sub segment to be property and proportional motor 
the worldwide specialty sub segment is primarily comprised of lines of business that are thought to be either short or medium tail 
the short tail lines consist of agriculture  catastrophe  energy  credit surety and specialty property and account for of the net premiums written in this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in aviation space  engineering and marine are considered by the company to have a medium tail and represent of this sub segment s net premiums written  or of the company s total net premiums written in specialty casualty business is considered to be long tail and represents of net premiums written in this sub segment  or of the company s total net premiums written in 
table of contents within the company s us p c sub segment  the company reported net adverse loss development for prior accident years in  and this primarily affected the casualty line in and and the motor line in the net adverse loss development in the casualty line in was primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities in a number of recent underwriting years on a limited number of treaties  and more particularly in the specialty casualty line 
during  the company observed an industry wide deterioration of loss development for prior accident years in the motor line  particularly on the non proportional treaties 
for the motor and casualty lines of business  the company received loss information from cedants for prior accident years that included no significant losses but a series of attritional losses 
attritional losses or reductions are losses or reductions than may not be significant on an individual basis  but are monitored on an aggregated basis by the company to identify trends that may be meaningful from a reserving standpoint 
upon consideration of this new information received during  and  the company revised the loss development assumptions it uses in performing its actuarial analysis and increased its expected ultimate loss ratios  which had the effect of increasing loss reserves for prior accident years by million  million and million  respectively  during  and in particular  the company revised the historical loss patterns and expected loss ratios that it uses in its actuarial analysis of loss reserves for the affected losses 
for the global non us p c sub segment  the company reported net favorable loss development for prior accident years in and  and net adverse loss development in during  the company observed an improvement in the loss experience in the property line 
losses reported by cedants during regarding prior accident years were lower than expected  which led the company to decrease its expected ultimate loss ratios  which had the effect of decreasing the company s loss estimates for prior years by million 
during  the company observed a deterioration in the loss experience in the motor and casualty lines 
losses reported by cedants regarding prior accident years were higher than expected  which led the company to increase its expected ultimate loss ratios  which had the effect of increasing loss reserves by million 
during  the company reported million of net favorable loss development 
losses reported by cedants during  and regarding prior accident years included no significant loss or loss reductions but a series of attritional losses or loss reductions 
for the worldwide specialty sub segment  losses reported by cedants during  and  for prior accident years  were lower than the company expected would be reported during  and  respectively 
this led the company to decrease its expected ultimate loss ratios for prior year losses in each of these years  which resulted in a decrease in the company s loss estimates of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
losses reported during and were lower than expected in most lines  while losses reported during were lower than expected primarily in the aviation  credit surety  engineering energy and catastrophe lines  partially offset by higher than expected development in agriculture  marine and specialty casualty lines 
losses reported by cedants during  and regarding prior accident years included no significant loss reductions but a series of attritional loss reductions

table of contents case reserves are reported to the company by its cedants  while acrs and ibnr are estimated by the company 
the following table shows the gross reserves reported by cedants case reserves  those estimated by the company acrs and ibnr and the total net loss reserves recorded as at december  for each non life sub segment in millions of us dollars case reserves acrs ibnr reserves total gross loss reserves recorded retroceded loss reserves total net loss reserves recorded us p c global non us p c worldwide specialty total non life the company estimates its net loss reserves using single point estimates for each sub segment 
these loss reserves represent the company s best estimate of future losses and loss expense amounts 
ranges around these point estimates are developed using stochastic simulations and techniques and provide an indication as to the degree of variability of the loss reserves 
the company interprets the ranges produced by these techniques as confidence intervals around the best estimates for each sub segment 
however  due to the inherent volatility in the business written by the company  there can be no guarantee that the final settlement of the loss reserves will fall within these ranges 
the point estimates recorded by the company and the range of estimates around these point estimates at december   were as follows for each non life sub segment in millions of us dollars recorded point estimate high low net non life loss reserves us p c global non us p c worldwide specialty it is not appropriate to add together the ranges of each segment in an effort to determine a high and low range around the company s total non life carried loss reserves 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events 
the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
loss reserves are established to cover the company s estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that it writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
in the event that the business environment and social trends diverge from historical trends  the company may have to adjust its loss reserves to amounts falling significantly outside its current estimate range 
management believes that the recorded loss reserves represent its best estimate of future liabilities based on information available as of december  the estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the period in which the need for an adjustment is determined 
liabilities for policy benefits for ordinary life and accident and health policies have been established based upon information reported by cedants supplemented by the company s actuarial estimates of mortality  critical illness  persistency and future investment income  with appropriate provision to reflect uncertainty 
future policy benefit reserves for annuity and universal life products are carried at their accumulated values 
reserves for policy claims and benefits include both mortality and critical illness claims in the process of settlement and claims that are assumed to have been incurred but not yet reported 
interest rate assumptions used to estimate liabilities for policy benefits for life and annuity contracts ranged from to 
actual experience in a particular period may vary from expected experience and  consequently  may affect the company s results in future periods 
included in the business that is considered to have a long reporting tail is the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s net reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses as of december  included million that represents an estimate of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims 
the majority of this loss and loss expense reserve relates to us casualty exposures arising from business written by partnerre sa and partnerre us see note to consolidated financial statements 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims 
in view of the changes in the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in valuing asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the loss reserves established by the company will not be adversely affected by the development of other latent exposures  and further  there can be no assurance that the loss reserves established by the company will be adequate 
the company does  however  actively evaluate potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional loss reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its loss and loss expense estimates 

table of contents premiums management must also make judgments about the ultimate premiums written and earned by the company 
reported premiums written and earned are based upon reports received from cedants  supplemented by the company s own estimates of premiums written for which ceding company reports have not been received 
the company derives its own estimates based on discussions and correspondence with its brokers and cedants during the negotiation of the treaty and over the treaty risk period 
the determination of estimates requires a review of the company s experience with cedants  familiarity with each geographic market  a thorough understanding of the individual characteristics of each line of business and the ability to project the impact of current economic indicators on the volume of business written and ceded by the company s cedants 
premium estimates are updated when new information is received 
differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
approximately of the company s reported net premiums written for are based upon such estimates 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of brokerage  commissions  and excise taxes  which vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition and renewal of reinsurance treaties  are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
the company is required under us gaap to evaluate the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and immediately expense amounts estimated to be unrecoverable 
a number of estimates  such as anticipated losses and loss expenses and the related premiums  other costs and investment income  need to be projected and considered by management in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
other than temporary impairment of investments the company regularly evaluates the fair value of its investments available for sale to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis original cost basis for equities is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost of the individual security is written down to fair value as its new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income in the period in which the determination of other than temporary impairment is made 
in contrast  temporary losses for available for sale securities are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income  but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately as realized losses in net income 
to determine whether securities available for sale with unrealized investment losses are impaired  the company must  for each specific issuer or security  evaluate whether events have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its investment in the security 
in the company s determination of other than temporary impairment  the company reviews and evaluates the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  general economic and financial market conditions  the length of time for which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below cost and other factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
as of december   the company held available for sale securities that carried gross unrealized losses of million  including million on securities that carried unrealized losses for more than twelve continuous months 
most unrealized losses were caused by increases in interest rates since the company s purchase of the investments 
in management s judgment  the company had no significant unrealized losses caused by an issuer s specific corporate risk or due to industry or geographic risk  for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken 
income taxes the company had net deferred tax assets of million arising primarily from net operating loss carryforwards that it can use to offset future taxable income 
realization of deferred tax assets depends on generating sufficient taxable income generally within a limited number of future periods 
in establishing the appropriate value of these tax assets  management has developed income projections based on what it perceives the trends are in reinsurance pricing  loss development and interest rates to evaluate the company s ability to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in each taxable jurisdiction prior to the loss carryforward expiration dates 
in the event that the company is unable to realize a deferred tax asset  for example with the expiration of an unutilized net operating loss carryforward  net income would be adversely affected to the extent a valuation allowance has not been established 
as of december   the company had no significant valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based upon management s assessment that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in the applicable jurisdictions 

table of contents goodwill on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the company make an annual assessment as to whether the value of the company s goodwill asset is impaired 
based upon the company s assessment at the reporting unit level  there was no impairment of its goodwill asset of million as of december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income in addition to forecasts of future cash flows and future profits 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded in net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
valuation of certain derivative financial instruments as a part of its art operations  the company utilizes non traded derivatives 
the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they are recorded 
the company uses internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these derivatives and develops assumptions that require significant judgment  such as the timing of future cash flows of reference securities  credit spreads and general levels of interest rates 
for weather derivatives  the company develops assumptions for weather measurements as of the valuation date of the derivative and for probable future weather observations based on statistical analysis of historical data 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in a significantly different valuation of the derivatives and significant adjustments to net income in the period in which the company makes the adjustment 
results of operations overview the company measures its performance in several ways 
among the performance measures accepted under us gaap is diluted net income per share  a measure that focuses on the return provided to the company s common shareholders 
diluted net income per share is obtained by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding 
as the effect of dilutive securities would have been antidilutive in due to the company s reported net loss  the fully diluted per share figure for the year ended december  was compiled using the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
net income available to common shareholders is defined as net income less preferred share dividends 
while the company s results for and included losses from significant catastrophic events  results for included no significant catastrophic loss 
to the extent that losses related to large catastrophic events affect the comparison of the company s results from year to year  their impact has been quantified and discussed in each of the relevant sections

for instance  many of the company s cedants underlying policies exclude flood damage  however  water damage directly related to wind damage may be covered 
the company expects that these issues will not be resolved for a considerable period of time and may be influenced by evolving legal and regulatory developments 
the company s actual losses from hurricane katrina may exceed the estimated losses as a result of  among other things  an increase in current industry insured loss estimates  the receipt of additional information from cedants  brokers and loss adjusters  the attribution of losses to coverages that  for the purpose of the estimates  the company assumed would not be exposed  in which case the financial results could be further materially adversely affected 
the impact of the large catastrophic loss events on net income  net income available to common shareholders and diluted net income per share in was partially offset by higher net realized investment gains  net investment income and other income 
these items are discussed in the section review of net loss income below 
preferred share dividends increased in after the company issued series d cumulative preferred shares series d preferred shares in the fourth quarter of in the same quarter  the company settled the purchase contracts associated with its peps units in exchange for newly issued common shares of the company and the company purchased and cancelled the series b cumulative preferred shares series b preferred shares that were part of its peps units 
the increase in preferred share dividends during is largely offset by a decrease in interest expense related to the series b preferred shares 

table of contents over net income  net income available to common shareholders and diluted net income per share increased in compared to as a result of higher net investment income and net realized investment gains  and lower preferred share dividends in the significant positive cash flows from operations generated by the company during and were the main contributors to the increase in net investment income 
the increase in net realized investment gains did not change the company s comprehensive income as it merely transferred the gain from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income and retained earnings

other components of net loss income include net realized investment gains and losses  interest expense  net foreign exchange gains and losses  income tax expense or benefit  interest in earnings of equity investments and distributions related to trust preferred and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities

the company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its profitability  it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate 
underwriting result should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business  which is also impacted by investment results and other items 
over underwriting result for the non life segment decreased by million from a gain of million in to a loss of million in the decrease was principally attributable to an increase in the level of large catastrophic losses of million  net of reinstatement premiums  and to a lesser extent to a decrease in the volume of business earned and a modest decline in profitability on the business earned in totaling approximately million 
both years included net favorable 
table of contents development on prior accident years as the company reduced its estimate of losses for certain lines as the at risk period for older underwriting years expired and updated information was received from cedants 
net favorable development on prior accident years increased by million  from million in to million during the components of the net favorable loss development on prior accident year losses are described in more detail in the discussion of individual sub segments in the next section 
reductions in other operating expenses of million and a decrease in other income of million explain the remainder of the variance in underwriting result for this segment 
underwriting result for the art segment increased in despite the higher level of large catastrophic losses of million  net of additional premiums 
as a result of unusual weather patterns in japan during  the weather line incurred realized and unrealized losses on weather derivative instruments during that year 
while the weather line returned to profitability in  the structured risk line incurred losses on hurricane katrina  rita and wilma  which mitigated the positive impact of the weather and structured finance lines 
underwriting result for the life segment improved in for three principal reasons 
first  the result included a million charge to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us second  the results also included a million loss on the indian ocean tsunami 
finally  the increase in the life book of business over the last few years resulted in an increase of million in net investment income allocated to this segment 
corporate expenses increased by million  from million during to million during the increase resulted primarily from the adoption  on january   of the fair value method of accounting for equity based awards on a prospective basis 
the latter resulted in a phase in period during which equity based compensation increases with each new grant until the first grants issued after adoption of the fair value method are vested and fully expensed 
equity based compensation increased by million during addition of staff in corporate departments and increases in other infrastructure costs were more than offset by reductions in bonus accruals of million during the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in investment income is primarily attributable to investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which amounted to  million in and  million in in addition  net cash proceeds of million from the company s capital raises in october also contributed to the growth in net investment income 
changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed approximately of the increase as a result of the decline of the us dollar  on average  against the euro and other currencies during the year 
net realized investment gains increased by million  from million during to million during  primarily as a result of gains within the company s equity portfolio 
realized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors with the most significant being the prevailing interest rates and equity market conditions  the timing of disposition of fixed maturities and equity securities  and charges for the recognition of other than temporary impairments in the company s investment portfolio 
as the company repositions its investment portfolio to take advantage of market conditions  it generates sales of securities that result in the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation on the securities 
the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation does not change the company s shareholders equity  as it merely transfers the gain or loss from the accumulated other comprehensive income section of the balance sheet to net income on the statement of operations and retained earnings on the balance sheet 
interest expense decreased by million in compared to as distributions on the series b preferred shares  which amounted to million per year and were presented as interest expense  ended in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by interest expense of million related to the million bank loan received by the company in october the company hedges a significant portion of its currency risk exposure as discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this report 
the combined effect of the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro  swiss franc  british pound and other european currencies from december  to december  as well as the company s hedging activities explained the reduction of net foreign exchange gains 

table of contents the income tax expense increased by million  from million during to million during  primarily as a result of a change in the geography or tax jurisdiction of pre tax income 
the company s income tax expense or benefit is highly dependent on the distribution of the company s pre tax results in each tax jurisdiction 
the company s taxable entities generated a higher pre tax income and tax expense during than  as a significant portion of the large catastrophic losses were incurred by a non taxable entity in this was partially offset by a reduction  in  in the valuation allowance in switzerland of million 
management concluded that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance as a result of the positive evidence  under sfas  of the ability of the swiss operations to generate significant taxable income during despite an unprecedented level of losses in the industry 
the company also updated  in  its in depth analysis of various tax exposures and  based upon its analysis  tax reserves were reduced by million 
the tax expense was net of a tax recovery in the amount of million related to the settlement of a tax arbitration in france and a favorable adjustment of million  net of valuation allowance  resulting from adjustments to prior year income tax returns in switzerland 
over underwriting result for the non life segment decreased  from million in to million in the decrease in the non life underwriting result was principally attributable to an increase of million in other operating expenses to support the company s growth and a modestly higher technical ratio that translated into a decrease of million in the underwriting result of this segment 
included in the underwriting result for the non life segment were million of net losses related to the atlantic hurricanes and indian ocean tsunami  partially offset by the strong market conditions as well as net favorable development on prior accident year losses of million  as the company reduced its estimate of losses for certain lines as the at risk period for older years expired and updated information was received from cedants 
underwriting result for the life segment decreased  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in while the life segment experienced growth during  the underwriting loss for was stable as it included a million charge recognized in the first quarter of to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us  as well as a million loss in the fourth quarter of related to the indian ocean tsunami 
the increase in corporate expenses resulted from management s effort to enhance the company s infrastructure to support the growth of the company s business and is primarily attributable to i an increase in staff in corporate departments  such as the actuarial  internal audit and tax departments  higher compliance expenses and iii higher equity based compensation expenses as a result of the adoption of sfas on january  the company reported net investment income of million in compared to million in the increase in investment income was primarily attributable to investment of the company s significant cash flows from operations  which amounted to  million in and  million in  as well as changes in average foreign exchange rates as the us dollar weakened during against the euro and other currencies  which contributed approximately to the growth in interest expense increased in compared to as a result of the change in classification of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in the third quarter of  following the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and requires that certain financial instruments  such as the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  be classified prospectively as a liability on the balance sheet and the related distributions be classified as interest expense on the income statement 
the company has classified distributions related to its mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as interest expense since july   which distorts the comparison of interest expense and distributions related to mandatorily redeemable preferred securities between and  but does not affect its net income or equity for these years 
the increase in net foreign exchange gains in compared to resulted primarily from a lower revaluation loss related to the company s net liabilities denominated in certain currencies that were not hedged and that appreciated against the us dollar from december  to december  the income tax expense increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a change in the geography or tax jurisdiction of pre tax income 
the tax expense was net of a tax recovery in the amount of million related to the settlement of a tax arbitration in france and a favorable adjustment of million  net of valuation allowance  resulting from adjustments to prior year income tax returns in switzerland 

table of contents the next section provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the company s underwriting result by segment and sub segment  investment income  net realized investment gains  operating expenses and other income for the years ended december   and results by segment the company monitors the performance of its underwriting operations in three segments  non life  art and life 
the non life segment is further divided into three sub segments  us p c  global us p c and worldwide specialty 
segments and sub segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography  client types  buying patterns  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
see the description of the company s segments and sub segments as well as a discussion of how the company measures its segment results in note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii below 
segment results are shown net of intercompany transactions 
business reported in the global non us p c and worldwide specialty sub segments and the life segment is  to a significant extent  denominated in foreign currencies and is reported in us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for each year 
the us dollar has fluctuated against the euro and other currencies during each of the three years presented and this should be considered when making year to year comparisons 
non life segment us p c the technical result  defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs  and the technical ratio  defined as the sum of the loss and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned  have been relatively stable in the two years preceding during  the unprecedented level of large catastrophic losses has impacted the technical result and ratio for this sub segment and has distorted year to year comparisons as discussed below 
the company believes the business written in this sub segment in and was profitable  notwithstanding the negative technical result for these years  once investment income is considered 
the us casualty line is included in this sub segment and represented approximately  and of net premiums written for  and  respectively 
this line typically tends to have a higher loss ratio and lower technical result  due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
casualty treaties typically provide for investment income on premiums invested over a longer period as losses are typically paid later than for other lines 
investment income  however  is not considered in the calculation of technical result 
the following table provides the components of the technical result and the corresponding ratios for this sub segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result loss ratio acquisition ratio technical ratio technical result is defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs 
loss ratio is obtained by dividing losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned 
acquisition ratio is obtained by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned 
technical ratio is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition ratio 

table of contents us p c continued over premiums the us p c sub segment represented of total net premiums written in the decrease in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned over resulted from all lines but was more evident in the motor and casualty lines 
the company observed increased competition in the short tail motor and property lines  as primary companies retained more risk and reinsurers were competing for a declining amount of business 
although pricing and terms and conditions remained fairly stable in for the long tail casualty line  the company s net premiums written also decreased for this line 
approximately a third of the decline in net premiums written for this sub segment resulted from reduced premium estimates from cedants for prior underwriting years  while the remainder resulted from timing of renewals  lower renewal premiums due to the increased risk retention by cedants  the cancellation of programs or non renewals where the renewal terms did not meet the company s profitability objectives and increased competition among reinsurers 
losses and loss expenses and loss ratio the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflect a losses related to the large catastrophic loss events in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment  b net adverse loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  or points on the loss ratio  and c a decrease in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the decrease in net premiums earned 
the net adverse loss development of million included net adverse loss development for prior accident years in the motor and casualty lines of million  partially offset by net favorable loss development in the shorter tail property line of million 
the net adverse loss development for motor primarily reflects actual loss experience during being worse than expected 
the net adverse loss development in the casualty line was primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities in a number of recent underwriting years for certain treaties  particularly in the specialty casualty lines 
in addition  but to a less significant degree  the company observed the emergence of unforeseen loss activity in certain older underwriting years within the non proportional casualty portfolio 
loss information provided by cedants for prior accident years in for all lines in this sub segment included no individually significant losses or reductions of losses but a series of attritional losses or reductions 
based on the company s assessment of this loss information  the company has increased its expected ultimate loss ratios for the motor and casualty lines decreased for the property line  which had the net effect of increasing prior year loss estimates for this sub segment 
the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by the increase of million in the level of large catastrophic losses and the increase of million in net adverse prior year development  partially offset by a reduction of losses and loss expenses of approximately million resulting from the decrease in the book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the decrease in net premiums earned 
acquisition costs and acquisition ratio while the company s book of business and exposure have declined in compared to  the acquisition costs for the year did not change significantly 
a shift from non proportional business to proportional business  which carries higher commission and brokerage expenses  and reductions of acquisition costs in on treaties with experience credits in the form of sliding scale and profit commission adjustments resulted in the increase in the acquisition ratio from to technical result and technical ratio the decrease in technical result and increase in technical ratio from to is explained by the increase of million in the level of large catastrophic losses  the increase of million in net adverse prior year development and a reduction of approximately million in profitability resulting from the decrease in net premiums earned 

table of contents us p c continued over premiums the us p c sub segment represented of total net premiums written in the growth in gross and net premiums written over resulted from the casualty line  where terms and conditions remained strong 
premiums in property and motor decreased principally due to the softening of terms and conditions and increased risk retention by cedants 
growth in this sub segment was impacted by the company s selectivity in pursuing business that met its profitability objectives 
losses and loss expenses and loss ratio the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflected a losses related to the atlantic hurricanes in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment  b net adverse loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million or points  c growth in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned  and d the continued expansion in the specialty casualty line that typically tends to have a higher loss ratio due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
the net adverse loss development of million included net adverse loss development for prior accident years in the motor and casualty lines of million  partially offset by net favorable loss development in the shorter tail property line of million 
the net adverse loss development for motor reflected primarily actual loss experience during being worse than expected 
the net adverse loss development in the casualty line was primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities due to what it believes are adverse industry wide trends in that line of business 
loss information provided by cedants in for all lines in this sub segment for prior accident years included no individually significant losses or reductions of losses but a series of attritional losses or reductions 
based on the company s assessment of this loss information  the company increased its expected ultimate loss ratios for the motor and casualty lines decreased for the property line  which had the net effect of increasing the level of prior year loss estimates for this sub segment 
included in the net favorable development in the property line was a million reduction in the company s loss estimate related to the september tragedy  as the company received information from cedants indicating that certain outstanding loss reserves were no longer necessary 
the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflected a no significant or catastrophic loss  b net adverse loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  c growth in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned  and d the continued expansion in the specialty casualty line that typically tends to have a higher loss ratio due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
the net adverse loss development of million included net adverse loss development for prior accident years of million on the casualty line and million on the motor line 
the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by growth in the book of business and the increasing proportion of specialty casualty business written in this sub segment  as the sum of the atlantic hurricane losses and prior year development for is comparable to the net adverse prior year development recorded in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio the decrease in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio from to resulted from reductions in acquisition costs on treaties with experience credits in the form of sliding scale and profit commission adjustments 
technical result and technical ratio the net improvement in the technical result and technical ratio from to is primarily explained by the decrease in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio  which was partially offset by the higher losses and loss expenses and loss ratio resulting from the increased proportion of specialty casualty business 

table of contents us p c continued outlook during the january  renewals  the company saw significant price increases on business exposed to the recent large loss events with mixed conditions on other business 
the company increased the portion of its book of business that renewed on january  in this sub segment by a single digit percentage 
based on overall pricing indications and information received from cedants and brokers during the renewals  management expects similar market conditions will prevail during the remainder of as net premiums written decreased in and are earned over the risk period  which is generally one to two years  net premiums earned are expected to be relatively flat in despite the growth in net premiums written during the january  renewals 
global non us p c the technical result for the global non us p c sub segment has fluctuated in the last three years  reflecting varying levels of large loss events and development on prior years loss estimates 
the company believes the business being written in this sub segment is profitable notwithstanding the negative technical result of  once investment income is considered 
the global non us p c sub segment is composed of long tail business  in the form of casualty and non proportional motor business  that represents approximately of net premiums written for in this sub segment  and short tail business  in the form of property and proportional motor business

without the positive contribution of foreign exchange  net premiums written would have declined by 
the decline in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned in resulted from all lines in this sub segment  but was more pronounced in the casualty line 
increased competition and increased risk retention by cedants are the principal reasons for the decrease in premium volume in this sub segment 
the company has remained selective in an increasingly competitive environment and has chosen to retain business that met its profitability objectives instead of focusing on premium volume

the net favorable loss development of million included net favorable loss development for prior accident years in the property and casualty lines of million  partially offset by net adverse loss development in the motor line of million 
the net favorable loss development was primarily due to favorable loss emergence  as losses reported by cedants during for prior accident years and for treaties where the risk period expired were lower higher for motor than the company expected

without the positive contribution of foreign exchange  net premiums written would have declined by 
following hurricane katrina  rita and wilma  reinstatement premiums of million and back up covers of million were recorded in the catastrophe line in this sub segment  which slowed the decline in net premiums written 
while the catastrophic loss events reversed the price competition in catastrophe exposed lines generally short tail lines  the decline in pricing  and net premiums written  continued in other lines in this sub segment 
in response to these conditions and to increased competition in this sub segment  the company has remained selective in pursuing business that met its profitability objectives and has declined treaties where terms and conditions did not meet the company s standards 
losses and loss expenses and loss ratio the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflect a losses related to the large catastrophic loss events in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment  b net favorable loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  or points on the loss ratio  and c a decrease in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the decrease in net premiums earned 
the net favorable loss development of million included net adverse loss development for prior accident years for the agriculture line of million  offset by net favorable loss development in all other lines of million 
the net favorable loss development was primarily due to favorable loss emergence  as losses reported by cedants during for prior accident years  and for treaties where the risk period expired  were lower higher for agriculture than the company expected 
loss information provided by cedants in for prior accident years for all lines in this sub segment included no individually significant losses or reductions but a series of attritional losses or reductions 
based on the company s assessment of this loss information  the company has decreased its expected ultimate loss ratios for all lines increased for the agriculture line  which had the net effect of decreasing the level of prior year loss estimates increasing for the agriculture line for this sub segment 

table of contents worldwide specialty continued the increase in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to is explained by the increase of million in the level of large catastrophic losses  partially offset by the increase of million in net favorable prior year development and a reduction of approximately million in losses and loss expenses resulting from the decrease in the book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the decrease in net premiums earned 
acquisition costs and acquisition ratio the decrease in acquisition costs in compared to results from the reduction in the company s book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the decrease in net premiums earned  and shifts in the mix of business as certain lines carry lower acquisition costs 
although the acquisition ratio is flat  two trends offset each other in the increase in net favorable prior year loss development resulted in increased sliding scale commissions and profit commission adjustments  which increased the acquisition ratio 
reinstatement premiums received by the company following hurricane katrina  rita and wilma carried lower acquisition costs than the average for this sub segment  which had the effect of decreasing the acquisition ratio 
technical result and technical ratio the decrease in technical result and increase in technical ratio from to is explained by the increase of million in the level of large catastrophic losses  net of reinstatement premiums  and a reduction of approximately million in profitability resulting from the decrease in net premiums earned  partially offset by the increase of million in net favorable prior year development 
over premiums the worldwide specialty sub segment represented of total net premiums written in gross and net premiums written and earned were relatively flat in compared to the weakening of the us dollar in compared to contributed approximately points of growth in net premiums written in this sub segment 
without the positive contribution of foreign exchange  net premiums written would have declined by 
the company had seen no real change in market trends since the second half of  where the pricing for the most profitable lines of business had started to decline and the other lines exhibited a slow but orderly reduction in the rate of price increases as a result of increasing competition 
however  following the high level of natural catastrophes in the third quarter of  the company observed that pricing deterioration slowed down in the markets and lines directly affected by these loss events 
in  the company remained selective in pursuing business that met its profitability objectives and declined treaties where terms and conditions did not meet the company s standards 
losses and loss expenses and loss ratio the losses and loss expense and loss ratio reported in reflected a losses related to the atlantic hurricanes and indian ocean tsunami in the amount of million or points on the loss ratio of this sub segment  and b net favorable loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  or points 
the net favorable loss development of million included net favorable loss development of million for prior accident years in all lines  except for the specialty casualty line that was affected by net adverse loss development of million 
the net favorable loss development was primarily due to a revaluation of the loss development assumptions used by the company to estimate future liabilities due to what it believes were favorable experience trends in these lines of business as losses reported by cedants during for prior accident years  and for treaties where the risk period expired  were lower higher for specialty casualty than the company expected 
included in the net favorable development was a million reduction of the company s loss estimate related to the september tragedy  as the company received information from cedants indicating that certain outstanding loss reserves were no longer necessary 
the losses and loss expenses and loss ratio reported in reflected a no significant or catastrophic loss and an exceptionally low amount of mid size losses  b net favorable loss development on prior accident years in the amount of million  and c growth in the book of business and exposure for this sub segment as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned 
the net favorable loss development of million included net favorable loss development for prior accident years of million on the aviation  credit surety  engineering energy  catastrophe and other lines  which was partially offset by net adverse loss development of million on the agriculture  marine and specialty casualty lines 

table of contents worldwide specialty continued losses reported by cedants during for prior accident years were lower than the company expected  which led the company to decrease its expected ultimate loss ratio for this sub segment for prior accident years 
the main factors influencing the company s lower than expected reported losses were a series of reductions in attritional losses and a lower number of newly reported losses by cedants 
net positive loss development included a decrease in prior year loss estimates of million related to the september tragedy 
the decrease in losses and loss expenses and loss ratio from to in this sub segment is explained by higher net favorable prior year development in  which was partially offset by losses related to the atlantic hurricanes and indian ocean tsunami 
acquisition costs and acquisition ratio the increase in acquisition costs and acquisition ratio in compared to resulted primarily from a shift from treaties previously written on a net basis  where premiums were ceded to the company net of acquisition costs  to treaties written on a gross basis  where acquisition costs were reported separately from premiums 
this change in the form of the treaty did not affect the technical result under the treaty but distorted the year over year comparison for acquisition costs 
other factors contributing to the increase included intensifying competition in this sub segment  which tends to increase the acquisition ratio  and a shift between lines of business where certain lines carry higher acquisition ratios 
technical result and technical ratio the increase in technical result and decrease in technical ratio from to is explained by the increase of million in net favorable prior year development  partially offset by the increase of million in the level of large catastrophic losses  net of reinstatement premiums  and a reduction of approximately million in profitability resulting from the decrease in net premiums earned and the decline in pricing and conditions in outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed divergent market conditions  with the us and northern european catastrophe exposed business  energy business and specialty property business showing strong price momentum and good growth 
most other specialty lines  including credit surety and specialty casualty  showed declines in pricing 
the company grew the portion of its book of business that renewed on january  in this sub segment by a low single digit percentage 
management expects that the environment will continue to strengthen during the remainder of in this sub segment  as the catastrophe line will benefit from a reduction of reinsurance capacity following the large catastrophic loss events 
it is important to note that growth in the company s catastrophe line in will result primarily from improved pricing as opposed to increased exposure 
as net premiums written decreased in and are earned over the risk period  which is generally one to two years  net premiums earned are expected to be relatively flat in 
table of contents art segment the art segment  the company s newest segment  was reported for the first time as a separate segment in this segment includes structured risk transfer  structured finance  weather related products and the interest in earnings of the company s equity investment in channel re 
as reinsurance accounting does not apply for much of the business in this segment  premiums alone are not a representative measure of activity in art 
this segment is very transaction driven  and revenues and profit trends will be uneven  especially given the relatively small size of this segment 
accordingly  profitability or growth in any year is not necessarily predictive of future profitability or growth 
the following table provides the components of the underwriting result for this segment for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result other income other operating expenses underwriting result interest in earnings of equity investment over the art segment had good growth in results during compared to  despite market conditions that impeded opportunities 
low interest rates  which tend to reduce the attractiveness of structured risk business for clients  and low credit spreads  which reduced the opportunities in the structured finance business  were prevalent in both years 
except for the structured risk transfer line  which was impacted by hurricane katrina  rita and wilma  all lines of business were profitable in  with the weather products and the company s interest in the earnings of its equity investment in channel re generating the largest contribution to growth in pre tax profit 
underwriting result for the art segment increased in despite the higher level of large catastrophic losses of million  net of additional premiums 
as a result of unusual weather patterns in japan during  the weather line incurred realized and unrealized losses on weather derivative instruments during that year 
while the weather line returned to profitability in  the structured risk line incurred losses on hurricane katrina  rita and wilma  which mitigated the positive impact of the weather and structured finance lines 
the company s share of the results of channel re for amounted to million and represented results for a twelve month period from october to september  as the company records income on its investment in channel re on a one quarter lag 
the amount is not comparable to the amount of million  which represented results for an eight month period from february  the date of the company s acquisition of an ownership interest in channel re  to september  over the art segment had good growth in business during compared to despite the lower interest rates and lower credit spreads experienced in while the commutation of two large treaties in accelerated the recognition of the margin on the treaties  this was partially offset by a loss of million in the third quarter of as one treaty incurred a loss related to the atlantic hurricanes 
results for the structured finance business were positive  while results in the weather line included losses resulting from higher than normal temperatures in japan 
overall  these events resulted in a net decrease in underwriting result for the art segment in outlook the company expects that current low interest rates and tight credit spreads will continue to impede growth in the structured risk transfer and structured finance lines  as well as the growth of channel re 
the company intends to offset these trends by cautiously exploring new business initiatives in related risk categories that should contribute to growth over time 

table of contents life segment the following table summarizes the underwriting result for this segment in millions of us dollars change over change over gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned life policy benefits acquisition costs technical result other operating expenses net investment income allocated underwriting result nm nm nm not meaningful allocated underwriting result is defined as net premiums earned and allocated net investment income less life policy benefits  acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
over premiums the life segment represented of total net premiums written in the increases in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned during compared to resulted primarily from three factors 
first  the company increased its book of mortality business at the end of  which resulted in higher net premiums earned in second  the company experienced growth in mortality lines  partially offset by a reduction in longevity and health products in finally  the us dollar has weakened on average in and premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
changes in average foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately points of growth in net premiums written in life policy benefits the increase in life policy benefits in compared to resulted primarily from the growth in the company s book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned for this segment 
the comparison was also affected by the effect of a reclassification made in for one large treaty where the cedant reported a reduction in life policy benefits and an equivalent increase in acquisition costs 
this reclassification affects the comparison of life policy benefits and acquisition costs for the years and the indian ocean tsunami also resulted in life policy benefits of million in acquisition costs acquisition costs included a million charge in to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us the charge was due to a prolonged period of low interest rates  which had a negative effect on these treaties and resulted in a charge reflecting the actual experience to date as well as a revised projection of future results given updated assumptions 
without the effect of this charge and the reclassification discussed above  which increased acquisition costs in  there would have been an increase in acquisition costs in compared to a shift in the mix of business for this segment in resulted in a higher proportion of mortality business  which tends to carry higher acquisition costs in the early years of the treaties 
net investment income the increase in net investment income for this segment for compared to is primarily attributable to the growth in the book of business 

table of contents life segment continued allocated underwriting result the improvement in allocated underwriting result in compared to is primarily attributable to i the million charge taken in to reduce deferred acquisition costs  ii the million life policy benefits related to the indian ocean tsunami incurred in  and iii the increase of million in net investment income allocated to this segment 
over premiums the life segment represented of total net premiums written in the increases in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned during and resulted primarily from two factors 
first  the company took advantage of the disruption observed in the european life insurance and reinsurance market as the poor performance of equity markets in the prior three years reduced the capital available in the industry 
secondly  the us dollar weakened during and and premiums denominated in currencies that appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
changes in average foreign exchange rates accounted for points of growth in net premiums written during life policy benefits the increase in life policy benefits in compared to resulted primarily from the growth in the company s book of business and exposure  as evidenced by the increase in net premiums earned for this segment 
this was partially offset by reclassifications made by a cedant in for one large treaty where the cedant reported a reduction in life policy benefits and an increase in acquisition costs 
these reclassifications affected the comparison of life policy benefits and acquisition costs between and acquisition costs the increase in acquisition costs in compared to was attributable to three factors including the reclassification discussed above  a change in the mix of business to certain lines which carried higher acquisition costs and a million charge recognized in to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties retained in the sale of partnerre life insurance company of the us net investment income the decrease in net investment income for this segment for compared to was attributable to a life annuity treaty for which the cedant had reported lower net investment income during allocated underwriting result the decrease in allocated underwriting result in reflects the indian ocean tsunami life policy benefits of million  the million charge to reduce deferred acquisition costs on annuity treaties and an increase in acquisition costs due to the growth in multi year mortality premiums 
outlook based on pricing indications and renewal information received from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  management expects that gross and net premiums written for this segment will experience single digit percentage growth in as net premiums written have increased in and are earned over the risk period  which is generally more than one year for single life and annuity premiums  net premiums earned are expected to have low double digit percentage growth in 
table of contents premium distribution by line of business the distribution of net premiums written by line of business for the years ended december   and  was as follows non life property and casualty property casualty motor worldwide specialty agriculture aviation space catastrophe credit surety engineering energy marine special risk art life total there were modest shifts in the distribution of net premiums written by line and segment in  and the shifts in distribution reflect the company s response to existing market conditions 
distributions of net premiums written may also be affected by the timing of renewals or the shift in treaty structure from proportional to non proportional basis  as well as other treaty terms 
the principal market conditions and their impact on net premiums written was as follows over net premiums written declined by in changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed points of growth as the us dollar weakened during compared to and premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated against the us dollar were converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
without the positive contribution of foreign exchange  net premiums written would have declined by 
foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all lines  increased competition  increased risk retention from cedants and lower cedant premium estimates for prior years are the principal reasons for the decrease in premium volume for the casualty and motor lines  reinstatement premiums received by the company following hurricane katrina  rita and wilma resulted in an increase in the premium volume of the catastrophe line  and the company signed a few large life treaties in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in higher net premiums written in over net premiums written increased by in changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed points of growth as the us dollar weakened during compared to without the positive contribution of foreign exchange  net premiums written would have been relatively flat 
foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all lines  as prices were declining in short tail lines  such as property  agriculture  aviation space  catastrophe and energy  the company determined to non renew certain treaties that did not meet its profitability objectives  a number of treaties were non renewed as a result of the cedant retaining the risk as opposed to ceding it to a reinsurer  and as prices and terms and conditions were still strong in casualty  motor  credit surety  special risk and life  the company took advantage of market conditions 

table of contents outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed divergent market conditions with business exposed to the large catastrophe losses showing stronger conditions  while other business showed either stability or declines in pricing 
as a result of shifting renewal patterns  the january  renewals are expected to represent less than of the company s annual non life business  down from approximately in previous years 
since approximately of the company s non life reinsurance business will renew later in  market trends observed during the january  renewals should not be used to extrapolate the company s annual net premiums written 
based on january  renewal information from cedants and brokers  management expects that net premiums written for the motor line will continue to decrease during the remainder of while premiums for the catastrophe line will grow 
as the catastrophe line is approaching the exposure limits that are imposed by management  growth for this line is expected to come from improved pricing and conditions as opposed to increased exposure 
premium distribution by treaty type the company typically writes business on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
on proportional business  the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant 
in non proportional business  the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio 
in both proportional and non proportional business  the company typically reinsures a large group of primary insurance contracts written by the ceding company 
in addition  the company writes a small percentage of its business on a facultative basis 
facultative arrangements are generally specific to an individual risk and can be written on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
generally  the company has more influence over pricing  as well as terms and conditions  in non proportional and facultative arrangements 
the distribution of gross premiums written by type of treaty for the years ended december   and  was as follows non life segment proportional non proportional facultative art segment proportional non proportional life segment proportional non proportional total over the modest shift in the distribution of gross premiums by treaty type for the non life segment for resulted primarily from million of non proportional reinstatement premiums related to hurricane katrina  rita and wilma 
the us dollar was weaker  on average  in than it was in as a result  changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed approximately points to the growth in gross premiums written in and affected the year to year comparison for all treaty types 
over a number of factors caused the modest changes in the distribution of net premiums written in compared to as follows i as prices were declining in a number of short tail lines  the company determined to non renew certain treaties  ii a number of treaties were non renewed as a result of the cedant retaining the risk as opposed to ceding it to a reinsurer  and iii the us dollar was weaker  on average  in than it was in changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed approximately points to the growth in gross premiums written in and affected the year to year comparison for all treaty types 

table of contents outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates and no significant reinstatement premiums  the company expects the distribution of gross premiums written by treaty type in will resemble the distribution  as the company expects cedants will increase their retentions and shift business from a proportional to non proportional basis 
premium distribution by geographic region the geographic distribution of gross premiums written for the years ended december   and  was as follows europe north america asia  australia and new zealand latin america  caribbean and africa total growth in the european market was influenced by the stronger average rates for the euro and other currencies against the us dollar in compared to and in compared to and this contributed to the increase in the european market for and and distorts the year to year comparisons 
growth in the life segment  which is written primarily outside the united states  also contributed to the modest shift to europe 
outlook based on january  renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  the company expects a modest increase in the percentage of gross premiums written in north america in premium distribution by production source the company generates its gross premiums written both through brokers and through direct relationships with cedants 
the distribution of gross premiums written by production source for the years ended december   and  was as follows broker direct the distribution of gross premiums by production source was comparable for all years presented 
outlook based on january  renewal information from cedants and brokers  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  the company expects no significant changes in the production source of gross premiums written during 
table of contents investment income the table below provides net investment income by asset source for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars change over change over fixed maturities short term investments  trading securities  cash and cash equivalents equities funds held and other investment expenses net investment income over net investment income increased in compared to for three principal reasons the invested asset base has grown significantly since december   as a result of the company s positive cash flows from operations of  million for and  million for cash flows from generated a full year of investment income in while cash flows from were generated during the year and had a smaller positive impact on s net investment income  the company converted the entire mbs portfolio into cash and invested in mbs tba dollar rolls during  which resulted in the company holding over billion in cash at june  and september  while holding mbs tba dollar roll instruments  the company received a total return similar to what it would have if it had held a long position in the mbs portfolio 
however  the accounting treatment of the mbs tba dollar rolls  which are accounted for as derivative instruments  is different from accounting treatment on the long mbs 
if the company had held a long mbs portfolio  it would have recorded a higher net investment income under us gaap  but would not have realized the gains generated by the mbs tba dollar rolls 
as the company held mbs tba dollar rolls  the net investment income was lower in by approximately million  and investment income denominated in currencies that have appreciated  on average  against the us dollar since december   has been converted into us dollars at higher exchange rates 
the average rate for the euro has increased by against the us dollar since  the canadian dollar increased by  both the swiss franc and the british pound increased by  and the japanese yen was flat 
changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed approximately point to the growth in net investment income for net investment income from fixed maturities and short term investments has increased compared to primarily due to the increase in the asset base resulting from the reinvestment of significant cash flows from operations during the last two years 
the company has increased its allocation to equities and trading securities during and this  compounded by the increase in the asset base  resulted in an increase in net investment income for these two categories of assets 
after incurring large catastrophic losses on the hurricanes  the company received million in october in the form of a loan of million and newly issued common shares of million  net of issuance costs 
at december   a significant portion of these funds was invested in cash equivalents and this contributed to the increase in the company s net investment income for this category of assets in over net investment income increased in compared to for two principal reasons the invested asset base grew significantly since december   as a result of the company s positive cash flows from operations of  million for and  million for  and

changes in average foreign exchange rates contributed approximately points to the growth in net investment income for the increase in net investment income in compared to was partially offset by the million decrease of net investment income related to holding mbs tba dollar rolls for a part of net investment income from fixed maturities  equities  short term investments  trading securities  and cash and cash equivalents  increased compared to  primarily due to the increase in the asset base resulting from the reinvestment of significant cash flows from operations during and the decrease in investment income on funds held and other was primarily attributable to one life annuity treaty  which reported lower investment income during compared to the increase in investment expenses in over was primarily a result of the company s larger asset base upon which expenses were incurred as well as costs associated with the internalization of the equity portfolio management 
outlook current economic indicators continue to suggest moderate global economic growth 
based on the prevailing economic indicators  and assuming constant foreign exchange rates  the company expects market interest rates to rise in the united states and to rise more modestly in europe during management expects that an increase in interest rates combined with the larger asset base at december   as well as expected positive cash flows from operations during  should contribute to higher net investment income for the company during net realized investment gains the components of net realized investment gains or losses for the years ended december   and  were as follows in millions of us dollars net realized investment gains on available for sale securities  excluding other than temporary impairments other than temporary impairments net realized investment gains on trading securities change in net unrealized investment losses gains on trading securities net realized investment losses gains on designated hedging activities net realized and unrealized gains on other invested assets other realized and unrealized investment gains losses total net realized investment gains realized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors with the most significant being the prevailing interest rates and equity market conditions  and the timing of disposition of available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities  and charges for the recognition of other than temporary impairments in the company s investment portfolio 
during the normal course of its operations  the company bought and sold securities to take advantage of changing market conditions and to reposition its investment portfolio 
since most of the securities in the equity portfolio carried unrealized gains  the sale of securities generated realized investment gains and reduced the unrealized investment gains recorded in the shareholders equity section of the balance sheet 
the realization of the unrealized market value appreciation or depreciation does not change the company s shareholders equity  as it merely transfers the gain or loss from the accumulated other comprehensive income section of the balance sheet to net income on the statement of operations and retained earnings on the balance sheet 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded other than temporary impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
approximately of the impairments recorded in related to securities of the industrial and manufacturing sector  while the balance of impairments was related to securities of the banking and finance sector 
approximately of the impairments recorded in related to securities of the banking and finance sector  while the balance was spread over many sectors

the increase in other income for compared to results primarily from the return to profitability of the art weather line  which had realized and unrealized losses in as a result of higher than average temperatures in japan 
the decrease in other income from to resulted primarily from losses in the weather line in and the decrease in profit on a non life treaty 
financial condition and liquidity and capital resources investments total investments and cash were billion at december   compared to billion at december  the major factors influencing the increase in were net cash provided by operating activities of  million  net proceeds from net issuance of the company s common shares of million resulting from issuance of common shares under the company s equity plans and a public offering in october of million  offset by payments for the repurchase of common shares under the company s share repurchase program of million  increase in the market value of the investment portfolio of million  issuance of the long term debt of million  offset by dividend payments on common and preferred shares totaling million  and other factors primarily including the net negative influence of the effect of a stronger u

the company employs a prudent investment philosophy 
it maintains a high quality  well balanced and liquid portfolio having the dual objectives of optimizing current income and achieving capital appreciation 
the company s invested assets are comprised of total investments and cash and accrued investment income 
from a risk management perspective  the company allocates its invested assets into two categories liability funds and capital funds 
liability funds represent invested assets supporting the net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s operating and reinsurance liabilities net of 
table of contents reinsurance assets  and are invested entirely in high quality fixed income securities 
the preservation of liquidity and protection of capital are the primary investment objectives for these assets 
the portfolio managers are required to follow investment guidelines as to minimum ratings  and issuer and sector concentrations 
capital funds represent the capital of the company and are invested to maximize total return  subject to risk assumption and portfolio diversification guidelines  including issuer and sector concentration limitations 
capital funds may be invested in investment grade fixed income securities  below investment grade bonds  convertible securities  and preferred and common stocks 
the company believes that an allocation of a portion of its investments to equities is both prudent and desirable as it helps to achieve broader asset diversification lower risk and maximizes the portfolio s total return over time 
the company s investment strategy allows  to a limited extent  the use of equity short sales  which represent the sales of securities not owned at the time of the sale 
these short sales are incorporated within a market neutral strategy  which involves holding long equity securities and a close to equal dollar amount of offsetting short equity securities 
the objective of the market neutral strategy is to neutralize any effects from the stock market as a whole and to generate absolute positive returns 
the company s investment strategy also allows the use of derivative securities such as futures contracts  credit default swaps  written covered call options and designated foreign exchange forwards  subject to strict limitations 
derivative instruments may be used to replicate investment positions  to enhance investment performance or to manage market exposures and duration risk that would be allowed under the company s investment policy if implemented in other ways 
at december   the liability funds totaled billion and were comprised of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and aaa  aa and a rated fixed income securities 
the capital funds  which totaled billion  were comprised of investment grade fixed income securities  below investment grade bonds  convertible securities and equity securities 
at december  and  approximately of the fixed income securities were rated investment grade bbb or higher by standard poor s or estimated equivalent 
approximately of the invested assets currently held by the company are publicly traded and  accordingly  market valuations for such securities are readily available 
for those securities not publicly traded of the company s invested assets or approximately million  consisting of its investment in channel re and other investments in non publicly traded companies  private placement equity investments and other specialty asset classes  valuation techniques depend on the nature of the individual asset 
the valuation techniques used by the company s investment managers are reviewed by the company and are generally commensurate with standard valuation techniques for each asset class 
at december   fixed maturities  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents had an average yield to maturity at market of compared to at december   reflecting the interest rate increases during at the same time  the duration of the company s investment portfolio shifted from years at december  to years at december  during  in anticipation of rising interest rates  management kept the portfolio duration shorter than its neutral duration and increased the allocation of capital funds to equity securities 
both these steps contributed to the positive total return  while the stronger us dollar during the year mitigated some of this positive performance 
the company s investment portfolio generated a positive total return of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for accounting purposes  the company s investment portfolio is categorized according to two distinct accounting classifications available for sale and trading securities 
for a description of the different accounting treatments afforded to these separate accounting classifications  see note f to consolidated financial statements 
at december   investments classified as available for sale comprised approximately of the company s total portfolio excluding cash and cash equivalents and other invested assets  with being classified as trading securities 
included in the available for sale category is the company s portfolio of fixed maturities  comprised primarily of investment grade securities issued by the us government or us government sponsored agencies  state and foreign governments  corporate debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities and equity securities 
in addition  as part of its investment strategy  the company invests a small percentage of its portfolio in below investment grade bonds  which are also classified as available for sale 

table of contents the cost  fair value  gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses on investments classified as available for sale at december  and  were as follows in millions of us dollars cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value fixed maturities us government states or political subdivisions of states of the us other foreign governments corporate mortgage asset backed securities total fixed maturities short term investments equities total cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value fixed maturities us government states or political subdivisions of states of the us other foreign governments corporate mortgage asset backed securities total fixed maturities short term investments equities total cost is amortized cost for fixed maturities and short term investments and original cost for equity securities  net of other than temporary impairments 
at december   the company had gross unrealized losses on its fixed maturities of million  of which million was attributable to investment grade securities and million was attributable to securities rated below investment grade 
the company s investment security with the largest unrealized loss position at december   for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken  had a gross unrealized loss of million  representing of the amortized cost of the security  which is rated aaa 
this unrealized loss  as well as a majority of the company s total unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities  is due to changes in interest rates 
typically  as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall  and vice versa 
the company believes that these decreases in value are temporary under current accounting guidance  and additional analysis of individual securities for potential other than temporary impairments was carried out by the company to validate its belief 
as of december  and  management believes that the company had no significant unrealized losses caused by other factors and circumstances  including an issuer s specific corporate risk or due to industry or geographic risk  for which an other than temporary impairment charge has not been taken 
additionally  the company has the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any recovery in fair value

as mentioned above  the company s portfolio managers have dual investment objectives of optimizing current income and achieving capital appreciation 
to meet these objectives  it is often desirable to sell securities when opportunities for superior expected returns are identified 
accordingly  recognition of realized gains and losses is considered by the company to be a typical consequence of the ongoing investment management activities 
the company recorded charges for other than temporary impairments relating to its investment portfolio in the aggregate amount of million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
typically  the company considers impairment to have occurred when events specific to a particular issuer have occurred that are likely to prevent the company from recovering its investment in the security 
in the determination of other than temporary impairments  the company considers several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  general economic and financial market conditions  the length of time for which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below cost or amortized cost on a continuous basis  and factors that may raise doubt about the issuer s ability to continue as a going concern 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as realized investment losses in the consolidated statements of operations  which reduces net income and net income per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized investment losses  which do not impact net income and net income per share but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income  except for those related to trading securities  which are recorded immediately as realized losses in net income 
see note q to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fsp fas and fas the adoption of fsp fas and fas is not expected to have a significant impact on the net income or equity of the company 
funds held by reinsured companies cedants the company writes certain business on a funds held basis 
as of december  and  the company recorded million and  million  respectively  of funds held assets in its consolidated balance sheets  representing and  respectively  of the company s total assets 
under such contractual arrangements  the cedant retains the net funds that would have otherwise been remitted to the company and credits the net fund balance with investment income 
in general  the purpose of the funds held balances is to provide the cedant with additional security that the company will honor its obligations 
the company is subject to the credit risk of the cedant in the event of insolvency or the cedant s failure to honor the value of the funds held balances for any other reason 
however  the company s credit risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to the cedant for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 

table of contents approximately of the funds held assets at december  earns investment income based upon a predetermined interest rate  either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized market index eg  libor 
interest rates at december   ranged from to  with the exception of one treaty  which earned 
under these contractual arrangements  there are no specific assets linked to the funds held balances  and the company is exposed only to the credit risk of the cedant 
with respect to the remainder of the funds held assets at december   the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant  or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire investment portfolio 
the company does not legally own or directly control the investments underlying its funds held assets and only has recourse to the cedant for the receivable balances and no claim to the underlying securities that support the balances 
decisions as to purchases and sales of assets underlying the funds held balances are made by the cedant  in some circumstances  investment guidelines regarding the minimum credit quality of the underlying assets may be agreed upon between the cedant and the company as part of the reinsurance agreement  or the company may participate in an investment oversight committee regarding the investment of the net funds  but investment decisions are not otherwise influenced by the company 
within this portion of the funds held assets  the company has several annuity treaties  which are structured so that the return on the funds held balances is tied to the performance of an underlying group of assets held by the cedant  including fluctuations in the market value of the underlying assets one such treaty is a retrocessional agreement under which the company receives more limited data than is generally received under a direct reinsurance agreement 
in these arrangements  the objective of the reinsurance agreement is to provide for the covered longevity risk and to earn a net investment return on an underlying pool of assets greater than is contractually due to the annuity holders 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the cedant  the risk of loss to the company is somewhat mitigated  as the company generally has the ability to offset a shortfall in the funds held assets with amounts owed to the cedant 
the company also has several property and casualty treaties in which the investment performance of the net funds held corresponds to the interest income on the assets held by the cedant  however  the company is not directly exposed to the underlying credit risk of these investments  as they serve only as collateral for the company s receivables 
that is  the amount owed to the company is unaffected by changes in the market value of the investments underlying the funds 
in those cases where the company is exposed to the credit or interest rate risk of an underlying pool of assets  the company has applied the guidance of derivative implementation issue no 
b embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments 
accordingly  the company has recognized as a realized gain or loss the value of the credit and or interest rate derivative embedded within the funds held balance 
in the case of the company s annuity contracts  there is also a resulting offsetting adjustment to deferred acquisition costs related to this business 
at december   the cumulative value of such embedded derivatives was determined to be a gain of approximately million  which is offset by an equivalent but opposite adjustment to deferred acquisition costs 
unpaid losses and loss expenses the company s unpaid losses and loss expenses for its non life operations are composed of the reserves for its non life and art segments 
at december  and  the company recorded gross non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively  and net non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of  million and  million  respectively 
during  the company incurred net non life losses and loss expenses of  million and paid net non life losses and loss expenses of  million 
additionally  the us dollar was stronger against most european currencies during and this resulted in a reduction of the non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses of million 
the incurred losses for the year ended december  after retrocession but before reinstatement premiums included large catastrophic losses of million of which million was related to hurricane katrina  million was related to hurricane rita  million was related to hurricane wilma  million was related to the central european floods and million was related to european winterstorm erwin 
the non life ratio of paid losses to net premiums earned was while the non life ratio of paid losses to incurred losses was for the year ended december  policy benefits for life and annuity contracts were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease of the life reserves in was principally due to the strengthening of the us dollar against most european currencies which resulted in a reduction of policy benefits for life and annuity contracts of approximately million while the life reserves in local currencies increased due to the growth of the life business 

table of contents the company establishes loss reserves to cover the estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that the company writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability 
loss reserves are estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time to reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
management believes that the recorded unpaid losses and loss expenses represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at december  the company s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses include an estimate for its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the net reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses in is attributable to change in currency exchange rates offset by settlement of claims and was not the result of a change in the company s view of its ultimate liability for this business 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques 
there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims and these uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
the company actively evaluates potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its estimates 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of its business the company is a party to a variety of contractual obligations as summarized below 
these contractual obligations are considered by the company when assessing its liquidity requirements and the company is confident in its ability to meet all of its obligations 
contractual obligations at december   were as follows in millions of us dollars total years contractual obligations long term debt principal long term debt interest operating leases other operating agreements contract fees under forward sale agreement unpaid losses and loss expenses other long term liabilities series c cumulative preferred shares principal series c cumulative preferred shares dividends na per annum series d cumulative preferred shares principal series d cumulative preferred shares dividends na per annum trust preferred securities principal trust preferred securities interest na per annum na not applicable the company s unpaid losses and loss expenses represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available as of december  and are not fixed amounts payable pursuant to contractual commitments 
the timing and amounts of actual claims payments related to these reserves might vary significantly based on many factors including large individual losses as well as general market conditions 
the company s series c and series d preferred shares are perpetual and have no mandatory redemption requirement 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further information 
neither the trust that issued the securities nor partnerre finance i inc partnerre finance  which owns the trust  meets the consolidation requirements of fin r

due to the limited nature of the information presented above  it should not be considered indicative of the company s liquidity or capital needs 
see liquidity below 

table of contents credit facilities in the normal course of its operations  the company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured credit facilities 
as of december   the total amount of such credit facilities available to the company was million 
these facilities are used primarily for the issuance of letters of credit  although a portion of these facilities may also be used for liquidity purposes 
under the terms of certain reinsurance agreements  irrevocable letters of credit were issued on an unsecured basis in the amount of million at december   in respect of reported loss and unearned premium reserves 
included in the total credit facilities available to the company at december   is a million five year syndicated  unsecured credit facility 
in september  the company amended and restated its unsecured credit facility on substantially the same terms and conditions as the original facility of june  with the exception that the tenor of the facility was extended to september   the addition of an accordion feature which enables the company to potentially increase the available credit from million to billion and an increase in the minimum consolidated tangible net worth that the company must maintain 
some of the credit facilities contain customary default and cross default provisions and require that the company maintain certain covenants 
the company s breach of any of the covenants would result in an event of default  upon which the company may be required to repay any outstanding borrowings and replace or cash collateralize letters of credit issued under these facilities 
at december   the company was not in breach of any of the covenants under its facilities 
additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
the pricing grid provides the company greater flexibility and simultaneously provides participants under the facility some price protection 
as long as the company maintains a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb by standard poor s and baa by moody s  the pricing on the facility will not change significantly 
the company s senior unsecured debt ratings are currently a and a by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
shareholders equity and capital management shareholders equity at december   was billion  an decrease compared to billion at december  the major factors contributing to the decrease in shareholders equity in were a net loss of million  a million negative effect of the currency translation adjustment resulting from the translation of partnerre sa s financial statements into the us dollar  a million decrease in net unrealized gains on investments  net of deferred taxes  recorded in equity resulting from changes in fair value due to the increase in interest rates  realization of a portion of these gains through sales of securities  as well as the strengthening of the us dollar  and dividends declared on both the company s common and preferred shares of million  offset by a net increase in common shares and additional paid in capital of million  due to the issuance of common shares under the company s equity plans and a public offering in october of million  offset by the repurchase of common shares of million under the company s share repurchase program 
as part of its long term strategy  the company will continue to actively manage capital to support its operations throughout the reinsurance cycle and for the benefit of the shareholders  subject to the ability to maintain strong ratings from the major rating agencies and the unquestioned ability to pay claims as they arise 
in may  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the company s stock repurchase authorization of million common shares  which effectively reinstated an authorized repurchase level of million common shares under the prior repurchase authorization in may as of december   the company has approximately million common shares remaining under its current share repurchase authorization of million common shares 

table of contents from the beginning of and until the industry experienced an unusual amount of large catastrophic losses in the third quarter of  the company repurchased in the open market  of its common shares  for a total cost of million  during the first nine months of the third and fourth quarters of were unprecedented in terms of natural disasters  including hurricane katrina  the largest insured event in history 
subsequent to those large losses  the company entered into capital transactions to raise long term debt and equity 
in october  the company issued  common shares for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and other transaction costs 
the company will use the proceeds of this capital issuance for general corporate purposes 
in addition  the company entered into a loan agreement with citibank  n

the loan will mature on april  and bears interest quarterly at a floating rate of month libor plus 
the company will not be permitted to prepay the loan prior to its maturity  and the loan is not callable or puttable by the lender other than upon an event of default 
the company also entered into a forward sale agreement to sell up to approximately million of its common shares in the next three years 
see off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion on the forward sale agreement 
in december  the company repurchased million of its shares under an accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total cost of approximately million  including the final settlement of the agreement 
during  the company also repurchased in the open market an additional  of common shares for a total cost of million 
during  the company issued million of series d cumulative redeemable preferred shares series d preferred shares 
a portion of the net proceeds from the sale was used to repurchase common shares under the accelerated share repurchase agreement 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
dividends on the series d preferred shares are payable quarterly and are cumulative

liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
management believes that its significant cash flows and high quality liquid investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operations for decreased to  million from  million in this decrease in cash flows is primarily attributable to a lower volume of premiums received and higher paid losses in compared to the increase in paid losses relates to payments on losses  including the atlantic hurricanes  made in the decrease in cash flows is partially offset by an increase in cash receipts related to the increase in net investment income of in compared to the growth in net investment income is a result of cumulative cash flows added to the portfolio over the past year 

table of contents the company is a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and other intercompany balances 
the company has cash outflows in the form of operating expenses  interest payments on the long term debt  dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and from time to time cash outflows for the repurchase of its common shares under the share repurchase program 
corporate expenses were million  common dividends paid were million in the form of quarterly dividends of per common share and preferred dividends paid were million for the year ended december  as the company entered into a new loan agreement in october to borrow million  the company expects to pay a total of approximately million of interest per year on this long term debt  assuming the same interest rate as december  however  the company expects that investment income on the loan proceeds will largely offset the interest expense on the loan 
on february   the company announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend to per common share or approximately million in total for  assuming a constant number of common shares and a constant dividend rate and approximately million in dividends for preferred shareholders 
since the company s inception in  the company has increased common share dividends every year  representing a compound annual growth rate over the period 
the company relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from partner reinsurance  partnerre sa and partnerre us to pay the operating expenses  interest expense  shareholder dividends and other obligations of the holding company that may arise from time to time 
the company expects future dividends and other permitted payments from these subsidiaries to be the principal source of its funds to pay expenses and dividends 
although the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries to the company is limited under bermuda and french laws and certain insurance statutes of various us states in which partnerre us is licensed to transact business  there are currently no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries  except for partnerre us that has a negative statutory earned surplus and may not pay cash dividends without prior regulatory approval 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the reinsurance subsidiaries of the company depend upon cash flows from the collection of premiums as well as investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments to meet their obligations 
cash outflows are in the form of claims payments  operating expenses as well as dividend payments to the holding company  and additionally  in the case of partnerre us holdings  interest payments on the long term debt and the trust preferred securities 
partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries have million in outstanding third party debt as well as million of trust preferred securities outstanding 
partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries have paid interest of million on the long term debt and the trust preferred securities in historically  the operating subsidiaries of the company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the company  the seasonality in the timing of payments by cedants  the irregular timing of loss payments  the impact of a change in interest rates on the investment returns as well as seasonality in coupon payment dates for fixed income securities  cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods 
the company expects that annual positive cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to cover claims payments through  absent a series of unusual catastrophic events 
in the event that paid losses accelerate beyond the ability to fund such payments from the operating cash flows  the company would need to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or arrange for financing 
the company expects a decrease in cash flows from operations in compared to as the company expects an increase in paid losses in resulting primarily from payments for the large catastrophic loss events  the majority of which are expected to be paid in notwithstanding  the company expects to continue to generate positive operating cash flows in the company and its subsidiaries have access to a revolving line of credit of up to million as part of the company s million syndicated unsecured credit facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
financial strength ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies on the company s capacity to meet its obligations 
some of the company s reinsurance treaties contain special funding and termination clauses that are triggered in the event the company or one of its subsidiaries is downgraded by one of the major rating agencies to levels specified in the treaties  or the company s capital is significantly reduced 
if such an event were to happen  the company would be required  in certain instances  to post collateral in the form of letters of credit and or trust accounts against existing outstanding losses  if any  related to the treaty 
in a limited number of instances  the subject treaties could be cancelled retroactively or commuted by the cedant and might affect the company s ability to write business

additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
the long term debt and capital securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries contain various customary default  cross payment and acceleration provisions 
these include  but are not limited to  failure to make interest and principal payments  breaches of various covenants  payment defaults or acceleration of indebtedness  certain events of bankruptcy and changes in control of the company 
at december   the company was in compliance with all required covenants  and no conditions of default related to any of the company s debt or capital securities existed 
off balance sheet arrangements in october  the company entered into a forward sale agreement under which it will sell approximately million of its common shares to an affiliate of citigroup global markets inc  which affiliate is referred to as the forward counterparty 
under the forward sale agreement  the company will deliver common shares to the forward counterparty on one or more settlement dates chosen by the company over the next three years 
the purchase price the company will receive from the forward counterparty will vary depending upon the market price of its common shares over a trading day period surrounding the maturity of the forward sale agreement in three years  subject to a maximum price per share of and a minimum price per share of 
if the company elects to settle all or a portion of the forward sale agreement prior to its maturity  the company will deliver common shares to the forward counterparty and will initially receive the present value of the minimum price per share  and the remaining payment  if any  due to the company will be made at maturity of the agreement based on the excess of the market price of the company s common shares over the minimum price per share at maturity of the contract 
settlement of the forward sale agreement may be accelerated by the forward counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events  and the maximum and minimum purchase prices will be reduced or increased quarterly depending on the amount of the company s dividends 
currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk due both to its ownership of partnerre sa  whose functional currency is the euro and to partnerre sa and partner reinsurance including the swiss branch underwriting reinsurance exposures and collecting premiums in currencies other than the us dollar and holding certain net assets in such currencies 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposure is to the euro 
during  the value of the us dollar strengthened approximately against the swiss franc  against the euro and the japanese yen  against the british pound and weakened against the canadian dollar 
since a large proportion of the company s assets and liabilities is expressed in these currencies  there was a net decrease in the us dollar value of the assets and liabilities denominated in swiss franc  euro  japanese yen and british pound and an increase for assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollar in net foreign exchange gains and losses amounted to a loss of million  a gain of million and a gain of million at december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange gains and losses are a function of i the relative value of the us dollar against other currencies in which the company does business  ii the difference between the period end foreign exchange rates which are used to revalue the balance sheet and the average foreign exchange rates which are used to revalue the income statement  iii the impact of the company s foreign currency hedging strategy  and iv the classification in the company s statements of operations of the foreign exchange gain or loss resulting from revaluing partnerre sa s transactions into that subsidiary s functional currency  the euro 
in accordance with sfas foreign currency translation  the foreign exchange gain or loss resulting from the subsequent translation of this subsidiary s financial statements expressed in the euro functional currency into us dollars  is classified in the currency translation adjustment account  which is a balance sheet shareholders equity account

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview management believes that the company is principally exposed to four types of market related risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
how these risks relate to the company  and the process used to manage them  is discussed below 
as discussed previously in this report  the company s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance assets and liabilities liability funds and those assets that represent shareholder capital capital funds 
at december   liability funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition 
this procedure seeks to protect the company against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
as the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone  it is important for the reader to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the company s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of both assets and liabilities in generally the same way 
at december   capital funds represented or billion of the company s total invested assets 
these assets represent shareholders capital and they are invested in a diversified portfolio that has the objective of maximizing investment return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
capital funds contain most of the asset classes typically viewed as offering a higher risk  higher return profile such as common stock  convertible and high yield bonds  private equity investments and real estate  in addition to high quality investment grade securities 
the company s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in us dollar denominated investments 
in considering the market risk of capital funds  it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification 
although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio  market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times 
consequently  the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks 
the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative securities  subject to strict limitations 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge market risk  to enhance investment performance  or to replicate investment positions or market exposures that would be allowed under the company s investment policy if implemented in other ways 
the use of financial leverage  whether achieved through derivatives or margin borrowing  requires approval from the board of directors 
the company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all investment derivative transactions 
see note k and note l to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures concerning derivatives 
the following comments address those areas where the company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations 
interest rate risk the company s fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall  and vice versa 
the company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities 
this process involves matching the duration of the investment portfolio to the estimated duration of the liabilities 
for loss reserves and policy benefits related to non life and traditional life business  the estimated duration of the company s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns 
for policy benefits related to annuity business  the company estimates duration based on its commitment to annuitants 
the company believes that this matching process mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis 
while this matching of duration insulates the company from the economic impact of interest rate changes  it does impact the net reported us gaap equity of the company 
the company s liabilities are carried at their nominal value  which is not adjusted for changes in interest rates  however  the company s invested assets are carried at fair market value  which is adjusted for such changes 
as a result  a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in the fair value of the company s investments and a corresponding increase  net of applicable taxes  to the company s equity 
an increase in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
as discussed above  a portion of the fixed income portfolio is designated as capital funds 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk reward relationship 

table of contents at december   the company held approximately  million of its total invested assets in mortgage asset backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
at december   the company estimates that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across all currencies would result in a million decrease or increase  respectively  in the market value of its fixed income portfolio including mortgage related securities 
this change does not take into account taxes or the corresponding decrease or increase  respectively  in the economic value of its reinsurance liabilities  which  as noted above  would substantially offset the effect on invested assets as an economic matter  although the offset would not be reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as noted above  the company strives to match the foreign currency exposure in its fixed income portfolio to its multicurrency liabilities 
the company believes that this matching process creates a diversification benefit 
consequently  the exact market value effect of a change in interest rates will depend on which countries experience interest rate changes and the foreign currency mix of the company s fixed income portfolio at the time of the interest rate changes 
see foreign currency risk 
interest rate movements also affect the economic value of the company s outstanding debt obligations and preferred securities in the same way that they affect the company s fixed income investments  and this can result in a liability whose economic value is different from the value reported on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the economic fair values and carrying values of its outstanding fixed rate debt and preferred securities at december   were as follows in millions of us dollars carrying value fair value long term debt trust preferred securities series c cumulative preferred shares series d cumulative preferred shares neither the trust that issued the securities nor partnerre finance  which owns the trust  meets the consolidation requirements of fin r 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million on its consolidated balance sheets 
fair value of the long term debt has been calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate reflective of current market interest rates 
for the company s trust preferred securities  series c cumulative preferred shares and series d cumulative preferred shares  fair value is based on quoted market prices  while carrying value is based on the liquidation value of the securities 
foreign currency risk through its multinational reinsurance operations  the company conducts business in a variety of non us currencies  with the principal exposures being the euro  the british pound  the swiss franc  the canadian dollar and the japanese yen 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
as the company s reporting currency is the us dollar  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may materially impact the company s consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
however  the company employs several strategies to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
even though the company is able to match its liability funds against its insurance related liabilities both by currency and duration  resulting in a natural hedge  it does enter into designated hedges to protect the value of its investment portfolio 
the company does not maintain invested assets in currencies for which its liability exposures are not material or in countries where it is unable or impractical to maintain investments 
in such cases  the company does not have such a natural hedge and is exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material 
for the non us dollar currencies for which the company deems the liability exposures to be material  the company employs a hedging strategy utilizing derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to ensure that its liability funds are matched by currency 
to the extent that the company has net asset positions invested in non us dollar currencies  forward currency contracts and other derivatives may be used to hedge these non us dollar currency exposures 
see note k to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the company s currency hedging activities 

table of contents as a second strategy  the company maintains capital funds primarily in us dollar investments 
an additional factor mitigating the company s foreign currency risk is the ongoing nature of its reinsurance operations 
cash receipts in foreign currencies from premiums can be used to pay claims and expenses incurred in the same currency 
at december   approximately of the company s liability funds were in us dollar denominated instruments and were us dollar denominated investments  while the company s unpaid losses and loss expenses were approximately denominated in us dollar and were us dollar reserves 
the table below summarizes the company s gross and net exposure on its december  consolidated balance sheet to foreign currency as well as the associated foreign currency derivatives the company has put in place to manage this exposure in millions of us dollars euro gbp cad chf jpy other total invested assets other net liabilities total foreign currency risk total derivative amount net foreign currency exposure as the us dollar is the company s reporting currency  there is no currency risk attached to the us dollar and it is excluded from this table 
the us dollar accounted for the difference between the company s total foreign currency risk in this table and the invested assets and other net liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the above numbers include the company s investment in partnerre sa  whose functional currency is the euro  and its canadian branch  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar  both of which the company does not hedge  partially offset by net short exposures in certain currencies 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to the other currencies held by the company would result in a million change in the net assets held by the company  inclusive of the effect of the derivative hedges 
credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
the company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities it purchases 
at december   approximately of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated aaa or equivalent rating  was rated a or better and of the company s fixed income portfolio was rated below investment grade 
the company believes this high quality concentration significantly reduces its exposure to credit risk on fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
at december   the company is not exposed to any significant credit concentration risk on its investments  excluding debt securities issued by the us and other aaa rated sovereign governments 
the company keeps cash and cash equivalents in several banks and may keep up to million  excluding custodial accounts  at any point in time in any one bank 
to a lesser extent  the company also has credit risk exposure as a party to foreign currency forward contracts and other derivative contracts 
to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
these contracts are generally of short duration approximately days and settle on a net basis  which means that the company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other as opposed to the notional amount of the contracts 
at december   the company s absolute notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts was  million while the net value of those contracts was a payable of million 
to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
the company is also exposed to credit risk in its underwriting operations  most notably in the credit surety line and in the business written by the company s art operations 
loss experience in these lines of business is cyclical and is affected by the state of the general economic environment 
the company provides its clients in these lines of business with reinsurance protection against credit deterioration  defaults or other types of financial non performance of or by the underlying credits that are the subject of the reinsurance provided and  accordingly  the company is exposed to the credit risk of those credits 
as with all of the company s business  these risks are subject to rigorous underwriting and pricing standards 
in addition  the company strives to mitigate the risks associated with these credit sensitive lines of business through the use of risk management techniques such as risk diversification  careful monitoring of risk aggregations and accumulations and  at times  through the use of retrocessional reinsurance protection and the purchase of credit default swaps 

table of contents the company is subject to the credit risk of its cedants in the event of their insolvency or their failure to honor for any other reason the value of the funds held balances due to the company 
however  the company s credit risk is mitigated by the fact that the company generally has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to cedants for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
funds held balances for which the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant or the investment return earned by the cedant on its investment portfolio are exposed to an additional layer of credit risk 
the company is also exposed to a limited extent to the underlying financial market risk of the pool of assets  inasmuch as the underlying policies may have guaranteed minimum returns 
the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to its trade balances receivable  namely reinsurance balances receivable and reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses 
reinsurance balances receivable from the company s clients at december   were  million  including balances both currently due and accrued 
the company believes that credit risk exposure related to these balances is mitigated by several factors  including but not limited to  credit checks performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances 
in addition  as the vast majority of its reinsurance agreements permit the company the right to offset premiums receivable from the clients against losses payable to them  the company believes that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced 
the company does not rely heavily on retrocessional reinsurance  but does require its reinsurers to have adequate financial strength 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
the balance of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses was million and the amount of the allowance provided for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable was million at december  equity price risk the company invests a portion of its capital funds in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale  million at december  
the company also holds marketable equity securities classified as trading securities million at december  
these equity investments are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
net payable for securities purchased includes equity securities sold but not yet purchased in the amount of million at december   which represent sales of securities not owned at the time of sale 
these obligations  which consist of the obligation to purchase the securities arising from such transactions  are also exposed to equity price risk 
the company reviews these assets on a regular basis to ensure that diversification strategies to manage this risk continue to be in place 
the company believes that the effects of diversification and the relatively small size of the existing investment in equities relative to total investments mitigate its exposure to equity price risk 
the company estimates that its equity investment portfolio has a beta versus the s p index of approximately 
beta measures the response of an individual stock s performance relative to a market return  where a beta of would be an equivalent return to the index 
given the estimated beta for the company s portfolio  a movement in the s p would result in an approximately or approximately million without taking into account taxes increase or decrease in the market value of the company s equity portfolio  or approximately and increase or decrease of the total invested assets and shareholders equity of the company  respectively
