the following discussions should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the sections of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and risk factors 
overview we are committed to creating and delivering novel therapeutics to address significant medical needs 
using proprietary technologies and processes  we seek to identify  optimize and develop novel drug candidates through our own internally funded drug discovery programs and in collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our collaborative research efforts have resulted in a portfolio of three partnered programs comprised of four compounds that have been advanced into human clinical trials  with six additional programs in preclinical development 
we have four internal programs in advanced discovery in addition to multiple partnered programs in discovery 
our internal proprietary research programs are primarily focused on immunobiology and immunological diseases 
we fully fund these programs and retain intellectual property and ownership rights to any compounds discovered 
at an appropriate point  we may license one or more of these compounds or programs to a partner probably a larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology organization 
out licensing at an appropriate point in the compound s development would enable us to take advantage of the additional resources  expertise  technologies and commercial organization of the licensee company in order to further the development and commercialization of the compound and has the potential to provide us with fees and milestone payments  as well as a share of sales or royalty payments if these compounds are developed into and marketed as new commercial products 
typically  these royalty payments would be due to us for the length of the relevant patent life on a marketed drug 
we expect out licensing could convert our proprietary programs into collaborative partnerships on terms we anticipate would be more favorable to us than our existing collaborations due to the reduction in the risk for the partner and the investment that we have made advancing the program to the stage at which it is licensed 
we focus the majority of our internally funded drug discovery programs on immunobiology and immunological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases for several reasons we believe many existing therapies for these diseases are lacking in one or more respects 
for example  methotrexate  the standard of care for rheumatoid arthritis  has serious side effects while newer biologicals are costly and may have safety and immunogenic concerns 
we believe that a drug developed to provide immunosuppressant therapy for transplant patients is likely to also offer medical benefit and commercial opportunity in other chronic diseases with similar underlying etiologies 
the last decade has seen significant progress in the understanding of the biology underlying the immune system and immunological diseases and its involvement in other therapeutic segments like alzheimer s disease  atherosclerosis and cancer 
we believe a treatment developed for one immunobiological disease may be further developed for another and  consequently  an investment in one therapeutic approach may potentially yield products for multiple disorders 
we have significant internal expertise and experience in immunological diseases as a result our proven record of delivering candidates in these therapeutic segments to our collaborators 
there are increasing commercial opportunities provided by a large  growing population of patients with immunological disorders including chronic and acute inflammation  autoimmune diseases  asthma and transplant rejection 
the estimated us market size for certain immunological and inflammatory diseases that our internally funded drug discovery programs focus on is as follows estimated market disease in billions psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease asthma rheumatoid arthritis transplant rejection multiple sclerosis we are building expertise and extending our capabilities into preclinical and clinical development so that we can advance both internal and partnered programs into clinical development 
in addition to our proprietary research  we have drug discovery collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
in contrast to many of our partnering efforts in the past  we now seek to establish broad  multi year alliances with the potential to result in drug candidates in which we retain a large share of ownership 
we intend to participate in the clinical development of some of the compounds that may result from these collaborations 
as a consequence  our goal is to enter into agreements in which we receive improved fees  milestone payments and royalties on net sales compared to our existing collaborations 
we currently contribute the following to collaborative drug discovery programs high and ultra high throughput screening capabilities that enable us to test hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds per week against disease related targets to identify active compounds that are further studied to determine if they meet the criteria of an early lead compound  pharmacological results in vitro and in vivo  optimized lead compounds resulting from the iterative modification of the molecular structure of early lead compounds to increase structural novelty  potency  selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties and reduce side effects  and potential development candidates resulting from lead optimization studies that meet specific potency  selectivity and safety criteria and possessing the appropriate pharmacokinetic properties consistent with advancement to further stages of drug discovery and development 
our collaborative drug discovery efforts have resulted in three therapeutic programs currently with candidates in phase i clinical trials targeting rheumatoid arthritis  an allergy asthma indication and an inflammation indication 
we initially identified p kinase inhibitor lead compounds in and entered into a collaborative partnering agreement with bristol myers squibb in this collaboration resulted in a compound that entered clinical trials in august a second compound resulting from that partnership  which is a back up candidate  entered phase i clinical trials in canada in december a third compound discovered in our laboratories  aimed at an allergy asthma indication  was the basis of a collaboration with daiichi pharmaceutical co 
and resulted in a drug candidate that entered clinical trials in november our schering plough relationship produced a compound which entered clinical trials in march for an inflammation indication 
associated with these development programs  we have received milestone payments from each of bristol myers squibb  daiichi and schering plough and  to the extent the compounds successfully progress through clinical development  we will be entitled to receive additional milestone payments 
we are also entitled under the agreements with each of these partners to receive royalties on the commercial sale  if any  of most new drugs resulting from these collaborations 
however  numerous additional studies are required to fully assess the potential of these clinical candidates before they reach the marketplace  and the results from preclinical studies and clinical studies conducted to date with these compounds are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be obtained in future clinical studies 
in addition to the compounds in the clinic  six more programs are at various stages of preclinical development  the point at which compounds are tested for safety in animals 
this stage is prior to the filing of an investigational new drug  or ind  application and the compound s exposure to humans during phase i of clinical development 
preclinical and clinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
we continue to pursue the discovery and development of product candidates using our integrated technology platform in both our internal and collaborative programs 
the drug candidates described above are at an early stage  and none has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
both our partnered clinical candidates and our internally derived compounds face the substantial risk of failure inherent in drug discovery and development 
at any stage of the clinical development process  our collaborators  or we  may decide to discontinue development of our product candidates 
to date  none of the compounds to which we hold complete or partial rights has reached the stage of a commercial product and  although we have received license and milestone fees  we may never receive any royalty payments  or any additional license and milestone fees  under our current or any future collaborations 
we do not expect that our product candidates will be commercially available for many years  if ever 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was full time employee fte funding and million was milestone payments  under our research collaboration agreements with schering plough 
payments under our schering plough collaborations since inception in have totaled approximately million  of which approximately million represents investments in our equity securities and milestone payments 
our longstanding research collaborations with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
the planned cessation of fte funding will have no impact on other areas of the collaborations  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in an inflammatory indication and multiple preclinical programs 
we will continue to be entitled to payments resulting from the successful achievement by schering plough  if any  of preclinical and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments from sales  if any  of products resulting from compounds already delivered by us and accepted by schering plough under the collaborations 
we are currently discussing potential partnerships with multiple companies to establish broad  multi year alliances that  consistent with our business strategy  have the potential to provide us with a larger share of product ownership than previous collaborations 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such alliances 
failure to replace the revenue from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition of funding from any new alliances may be different from revenue recognition of funding from the schering plough collaborations 
failure to replace the funding from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was fte funding and million was milestones and success fees  under our research collaboration agreements with organon 
payments under our organon collaborations since inception in have totaled approximately million  of which approximately million represents investments in our equity securities and approximately million was milestone and success fee payments 
the agreement with organon has a stated research term of five years 
failure to replace the funding from the organon collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
from time to time we have considered  and we will continue to consider strategic initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
in addition  we consider opportunities to expand our product pipeline through the acquisition or in licensing of  or investment in  product development candidates  and we intend to continue to explore and evaluate those opportunities

our ethics and business conduct policy was adopted in its current form in march and is posted on our website above 
the ethics and business conduct policy applies to all of our employees and directors 
our industry industry overview drug discovery and development is the process of creating and evaluating chemical or biological entities for the treatment of human disease 
biological  chemical  pharmacological  clinical and informatics expertise are key components of a successful drug discovery effort 
the role of biology includes understanding disease mechanisms  identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention and evaluating potential drug candidates 
chemistry s role includes the creation of safe and effective new chemical entities to interact with these targets and the preparation of adequate quantities of active ingredient for preclinical and clinical testing 
informatics improves decision making by identifying and predicting the characteristics of successful drugs  efficiently sharing current knowledge and creating databases to predict future discovery and clinical success 
pharmacology includes the understanding of diseases and disease processes and how these may be modulated by therapeutic intervention with chemical compounds  as well as the understanding and measurement of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic and toxicological effects of potential drug molecules 
our drug discovery process although many scientific disciplines are required for new drug discovery and development  chemistry  biology and pharmacology are at the center of this process 
chemists  pharmacologists and biologists typically work together to design  prepare and deliver new chemical substances  develop laboratory models of disease  test compounds to identify agents that demonstrate the desired activity and finally select a clinical candidate 
the drug discovery and development process includes the following steps lead identification 
during the lead identification phase  researchers screen libraries  ie  collections of compounds  against disease targets to evaluate their potential as lead compounds compounds that may be a starting point for further chemical modification to produce a clinical candidate molecule in a process known as primary screening 
to maximize the prospects of discovering promising new compounds during primary screening  many researchers seek to utilize diverse collections of molecules that cover a broad range of possible chemical structures 
scientists must balance  however  this desire for diversity in chemical composition against the requirement that the compounds have drug like properties  such that their chemical structures render them likely to be bioavailable and non toxic 
the imperatives of diversity and drug likeness present scientists with a trade off in their experimentation 
researchers can address these dual needs by efficiently screening large collections of molecules that are diverse in structure  but drug like in character 
once active compounds are generated from primary screening  medicinal chemists determine which compounds are most promising by analyzing the structure activity relationships sar data generated during the screening process 
sar information educates scientists with respect to the relationship between the chemical structures of a series of structurally related active and inactive compounds and the activity of the compounds within the series at the target that has been screened 
as a result  a lead identification process which yields the richest sar information will best guide the chemist towards creating compounds having chemical structures most likely to improve the potency  efficacy  bioavailability and toxicity properties of the original active compound 
large  diverse  densely populated compound libraries tend to produce substantially richer sar data than smaller  less dense collections  providing chemists with the information needed to initiate successful optimization and reduce false starts 
a further benefit of our screening process  which we believe is unique to us  is that false positives compounds indicated to be active in a biological screen which subsequently turn out to be inactive a general industry shortcoming of high throughput screening are largely eliminated in our process 
lead optimization 
lead optimization is the iterative process of refining the chemical structure of a compound in an attempt to improve its drug characteristics with the goal of producing a preclinical drug candidate 
specifically  medicinal chemists attempt to create compounds with characteristics superior to those of an identified lead candidate 
common among these characteristics are potency  selectivity  pharmacodynamics and or pharmacokinetics absorption  solubility  half life and metabolism 
the lead optimization process involves chemical synthesis  biological testing  analytical chemistry  pharmacology and data analysis 
historically  lead optimization has not proven to be nearly as amenable as lead identification to the efficiencies and economies of scale of industrialization 
optimization remains largely a manual undertaking  with chemists personally synthesizing numerous compounds for further evaluation 
because most compounds created ultimately will not be utilized in the subject drug discovery program  a key to reducing optimization costs is to lower the number of molecules that must be synthesized to discover a new drug 
we accomplish this reduction by utilizing rich sar data we identify from screening our compound libraries 
we also employ parallel synthesis in our lead optimization efforts to improve the efficiency of the process  a process which is common in the industry 
we believe our extensive sar data  our ability to eliminate false positives and the multiple starting points often afforded by our screening process and our libraries that provide us a competitive advantage in lead optimization  in addition to the competitive advantage we believe we have in lead identification 
preclinical development 
during the lead optimization phase  but prior to clinical testing  potential drug candidates undergo extensive in vitro non animal testing in a laboratory  and in vivo testing in animals studies 
these efforts are designed to predict drug efficacy and safety in humans 
the ultimate objective of preclinical testing is to obtain results that will allow selection of a clinical candidate to enter human clinical trials following regulatory approval 
in parallel  scientists continue to synthesize additional compounds that act as back ups for the lead compound 
researchers will also continue to refine the process for manufacturing larger quantities of the compound  with the goals of reducing production costs while ensuring safety 
once a successful process is developed  batches of compounds are synthesized for animal and human testing during the preclinical and  later  the clinical development phase 
we currently lease a facility for conducting our preclinical development  including in vivo evaluation 
we plan to contract preclinical development expertise and the manufacturing of active ingredients 
clinical trials 
clinical trials  or human tests to determine the safety and efficacy of potential drug candidates  typically comprise three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap phase i the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion 
phase ii this phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase iii when phase ii evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase iii trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
the trend towards longer trial durations and larger test populations has necessitated the production of large volumes of potential drugs for these tests 
if successful  clinical trials in the united states result in the filing of a new drug application nda with the fda 
similarly  separate clinical trials must be conducted and regulatory approvals secured before a drug can be marketed internationally 
we have not conducted our own clinical trials to date  but we are building our capability to manage and oversee clinical development of our compounds if they reach that level of development 
we are working with clinical development consultants to augment our internal capabilities 
our business strategy our objective is to increase our pipeline of proprietary and partnered drug candidates 
our strategies to achieve this objective are as follows commence additional internal drug discovery programs  increase our investment in our existing internal discovery programs and license these programs at an appropriate point to pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners or retain ownership to market launch 
central to our strategy is increased investment in our internal drug discovery programs to build a pipeline of drug discovery and development programs which we own 
our intent is to partner these programs at increasingly later stages  and thus retain an increasingly larger share of the revenues should one of these programs result in the successful launch of a marketed drug 
we may attempt to retain ownership of such programs until market launch  if any  if the circumstances are favorable 
enter into new and expanded research collaborations 
through collaborative efforts with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners  we have built a substantial pipeline of drug candidates 
it is our strategy to add to this sizable pipeline of programs 
each new collaboration or other business arrangement into which we enter has the potential to augment this pipeline 
third party alliances also provide sources of current and or prospective revenue for us  effectively funding our internal product generation efforts 
as candidates progress through the development process  the milestone payments due from collaborators increase sharply  providing incentive for us to develop a robust drug pipeline 
in contrast to many of our partnering efforts in the past  we now seek to establish alliances which are broad in scope and multi year in term to deliver compounds that are more mature than in the past  ideally compounds that are clinical candidates  as opposed to hits or leads 
as a result of delivering later stage compounds  which are of greater value  we will seek to retain a larger share of ownership as represented by increased royalties on net sales that may result from the program advancing to the market in the compound 
additionally  we will  where appropriate  evolve the collaborative model by offering to reduce our research fees in exchange for greater milestone and royalty commitments from the partner 
expand our business through strategic transactions 
from time to time we have considered  and we will continue to consider in the future  if and when any appropriate opportunities become available  strategic initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
we believe that there are opportunities to expand our product pipeline through the acquisition or in licensing of  or investment in  product development candidates  and we intend to continue to explore and evaluate those opportunities 
in certain cases  we may determine to structure a transaction in which we would issue our equity securities in payment of the purchase price or to satisfy capital contribution requirements 
continue to develop our drug pipeline by adding skills and expertise in the areas of discovery  pharmacology and preclinical and clinical drug development 
we intend to continue to build our knowledge base of the relationship between classes of chemical structures and classes of biological targets 
we believe this knowledge base will enable us to more quickly discover active compounds for newly identified targets 
currently  we have chosen to focus our internally funded drug discovery programs on immunological diseases  and we intend to add to our significant internal expertise with respect to these diseases resulting from certain of our successful collaborations 
we may add to our internal expertise by hiring and or acquiring additional resources 
our therapeutic candidate pipeline we have built a partnered therapeutic candidate pipeline consisting of three clinical programs with respect to which human evaluation has begun  six preclinical programs and multiple other drug discovery programs 
some of these programs started as collaborative drug discovery partnerships  while others started from our internal discovery efforts 
in all cases  we have a financial interest in each of the subject compounds 
our partnered portfolio covers a broad range of disease areas 
our partners have diverse therapeutic interests  and thus our product pipeline spans multiple disease categories 
lead compounds discovered in a collaboration can show therapeutic activity and  therefore  lead to milestone and subsequent payments in a variety of disease areas 
accordingly  therapeutic focus is not necessarily a critical factor in the success of our collaborative efforts 
this has allowed us to diversify our portfolio of programs across multiple disease categories 
within our internal programs we have concentrated our efforts on diseases related to immunobiology and also situations where modulation of an otherwise healthy immune system is desirable 
disorders which are impacted are rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis  inflammatory bowel disease  organ transplant rejection  multiple sclerosis and others 
this focus builds on our expertise in the area  and also takes advantage of attractive commercial opportunities we believe exist 
the following chart sets forth our internal program portfolio and the disease areas in which the program is likely relevant 
with the exception of the rights to our avb avb inhibitors for an angiogenesis indication  which have been out licensed to allergan  inc  each of the candidates set forth in the chart is a proprietary program of ours that is not partnered with a collaborator 
internal program portfolio proprietary program therapeutic areas jak inhibitors transplant rejection  psoriasis  asthma and rheumatoid arthritis ccr antagonists rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis aa antagonists huntingdon s  parkinson s and alzheimer s diseases avb avb inhibitors angiogenesis  oncology and inflammation jak inhibitors 
janus kinase jak is a t cell selective  non receptor protein tyrosine kinase and an essential component of il signal transduction 
current immunosuppressant therapeutics  rapamycin and cyclosporin  work in the il signal transduction pathway  but have narrow therapeutic indices as a consequence of significant safety issues 
a bio available and selective inhibitor of jak kinase should augment or supplant these current therapies for solid organ transplant rejection 
we have identified a novel class of small molecule inhibitors of jak kinase 
lead compounds in this series inhibit jak kinase with ic values nm  and inhibit jak dependent activity in cellular assays with ic values nm 
compounds demonstrate fold selectivity over jak in the kinase assay  and fold selectivity against a panel of protein kinases 
compounds demonstrate oral activity in vivo in an il mechanistic model and oral efficacy in a delayed type hypersensitivity dth assay 
furthermore  compounds demonstrate good microsome stability and high oral bioavailability ccr antagonists 
preclinical studies of ccr antagonists have shown activity in preclinical models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis  as well as reduced lung impairment in pulmonary inflammation 
accordingly  our ccr program has the potential to produce novel and more effective treatments for these major diseases 
compounds from our lead series inhibit binding to the human and mouse ccr receptors with ic values nm 
in addition  they inhibit chemotaxis in human cells with ic values nm 
furthermore  compounds demonstrate good microsome stability and in vitro permeability 
adenosine aa antagonists 
adenosine aa antagonists have been found to increase dopaminergic activity and motor function in models of parkinson s disease 
lead compounds have been identified from several series 
these compounds inhibit binding to the aa receptor with ki values nm  and inhibit functional activity with ic values nm 
the compounds demonstrate fold selectivity for the aa receptor over the a receptor  and show very good solubility  microsome stability and in vitro permeability 
a vb a vb inhibitors 
in angiogenesis a leading cause of age related macular degeneration  or amd  and proliferative diabetic retinopathy and a critical requirement of tumor growth and metastasis avb and avb are predominantly expressed on growth factor activated vascular endothelial cells 
we have identified a class of small molecule dual inhibitors of avb and avb ps has an ic nanomolar nm in integrin binding assays  blocks fgf and vegf induced human endothelial cell proliferation ic nm  inhibits vitronectin induced endothelial cell transwell migration ic nm and inhibits corneal and retinal neovascularization in rodent models 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement with allergan  inc to further evaluate proprietary compounds from our avb avb program in models of ocular disease 
the agreement resulted in an upfront payment from allergan to us and may result in preclinical and clinical payments  plus milestone payments and royalties on products developed by allergan in the field of ophthalmology 
we have retained the rights to all other therapeutic areas  including oncology and inflammation 
external resources in an effort to increase the efficiency of both our internal and collaborative programs  we have established a strategic arrangement with wu xi pharmatech of shanghai  china 
additionally  we utilize resources in india 
these external resources provide specific and general chemistry services to us at a cost substantially lower than our internal costs 
we also utilize contract research organizations globally to evaluate our compounds in special non clinical models of disease and to assess the safety of our lead compounds 
further  we engage in research collaborations with academic institutions to access their considerable expertise  in particular for the testing of our compounds in specific non clinical models of disease 
we also contract with other biotechnology companies to perform fee for service testing of compounds both for internal and collaborative drug discovery 
by effectively integrating external resources in to our research and development programs  we cost effectively extend our capabilities and expand our capacity without the need for substantial investment in new infrastructure 
our core technology and drug discovery platform in our view  the limited number and diversity of available chemical compounds as potential drug candidates has become a major bottleneck in the drug discovery process 
the low productivity of many synthesis technologies severely constrains the number of compounds available for screening in order to identify active compounds and provide the basis for initial sar analysis 
these synthesis methods also slow the optimization process by limiting the number of analogs synthesized and tested 
as genomics and the mapping of the human genome have generated numerous potential new disease targets and advances in high throughput screening have led to a backlog of lead compounds showing some therapeutic activity  we believe that the shortage of sophisticated medicinal chemistry expertise in the industry has had a dampening effect on the progress of drug development 
we believe that our talented team of chemists and biologists  equipped with our proprietary combinatorial chemistry technology  compound collection and state of the art medicinal chemistry and computational tools  offer a unique solution to these and other constraints on the productivity and success of the drug discovery process 
importantly  our technology uses solid phase synthesis and an encoding system to permit rapid identification of compounds synthesized in combinatorial mixtures 
further  our approach to drug discovery makes extensive use of software and informatics products to assist in the modeling of potential therapeutics  the simulation of interactions between compounds and biological targets and the collection  storage and use of the data generated from our research activities 
in our view  these technologies  taken together with the broad experience and proven ability garnered by our scientists through their work with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  provide us with a competitive advantage in preclinical drug discovery 
our drug discovery approach is supported by our proprietary combinatorial chemistry encoding technology  encoded combinatorial libraries on polymeric support eclips  our proprietary collection of chemical compounds  assay technology  production automation  information systems and quality assurance programs 
these are more fully described below 
eclips technology 
eclips enables us to generate hundreds of thousands of small molecule compounds at a fraction of the cost of traditional chemical synthesis methods 
we use direct divide combinatorial chemistry to build collections  or libraries  of  to  or more small molecule compounds by performing only to individual chemical reactions 
eclips offers substantial productivity improvements as compared to the  to  or more reactions that would be required to prepare similarly sized chemical libraries by synthesizing each compound individually 
the eclips technology productivity advantage results from the synthesis of compounds on tiny plastic beads in large mixtures  to which we attach proprietary  easily detectable  stable tag sets to enable the rapid identification from the mixture of any compound that is active in a biological screening assay 
we use eclips technology to build libraries of small compounds  predominantly heterocycles 
these low molecular weight compounds are preferred by pharmaceutical companies because they are more likely to be orally active effective as drugs in tablet or capsule form  tend to have longer duration of action and are less expensive to manufacture 
in contrast  natural peptide and oligonucleotide drugs are usually degraded by human digestive system enzymes and generally must be administered by injection 
in addition  peptide and oligonucleotide drugs are often quickly eliminated from the body  which limits their duration of action 
further  the eclips technology allows rapid resynthesis of compounds without deconvolution  a process in which an active compound must be reverse engineered by resynthesizing and testing various component combinations until the structure of the active compound is deduced 
our eclips technology enables us to build large  densely packed libraries of drug like compounds that generate rich sar information from the primary screening process 
this sar data greatly facilitates our drug candidate optimization by providing our medicinal chemists with a type of structural roadmap to guide their optimization efforts 
lead optimization is further accelerated by our expertise in combinatorial chemistry 
our scientists build combinatorial libraries of compounds around molecules and assay the molecules in an effort to determine the most promising course for ongoing synthesis 
our tagging technology has been licensed exclusively from columbia university  columbia and cold spring harbor laboratory cold spring since we are obligated to pay a minimum annual license fee of  to columbia and cold spring 
the agreement ends on the later of i july  or ii the expiration of the last patent relating to the technology  at which time we will have a fully paid license to the technology 
under the agreement  we have an exclusive license for technology used in eclips 
the license granted to us under the agreement can be terminated by columbia and cold spring i upon days written notice to us if we materially breach the agreement and we fail to cure such material breach in accordance with the agreement or ii if we commit any act of bankruptcy  become insolvent  file a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or have any such petition filed against us that is not dismissed within days 
we are also obligated to pay royalties to columbia and cold spring based on net sales of pharmaceutical products we develop  as well as a percentage of all other payments such as milestones and royalties we receive from customers where we have utilized the technology licensed from columbia and cold spring 
our compound collection 
we have employed eclips  together with other technologies  to synthesize approximately million chemical compounds 
our proprietary collection is organized into libraries  consisting of both large and diverse discovery libraries of  compounds and smaller targeted libraries designed to interact with particular disease targets or classes of targets 
our collection has had success producing compounds found to be therapeutically active against difficult targets supplied by our partners  in the primary screening process  our libraries often produce hundreds of active compounds of varying potencies rather than the handful generated by some other collections 
our small molecule libraries have been engineered to be both drug like and diverse 
our criteria for determining whether or not we have been successful in the screening of our compound library against a particular disease target are both rigorous and relatively simple 
we measure our success by evaluating the potency of each screened compound in inducing  or inhibiting  activity in the target at specified concentrations of the compound per liter 
a screen against a given target is deemed to be successful if we discover at least one compound from our collection that is active in the desired manner against the target at the prescribed concentration 
we report our success to our collaborators in terms of activity of the compound against the applicable target at concentrations agreed to with our partner in advance 
our compound collection and high throughput screening technologies have been proven to be effective against a wide variety of biological targets 
importantly  we have achieved success against some of our collaborators most difficult targets  often after our partners internal drug discovery efforts were unsuccessful 
our libraries have been shown to be particularly effective against some of the industry s most important disease targets  such as g protein coupled receptors gpcrs and kinases 
for example  of the kinases we have screened to date  potent active compounds from our library were discovered in cases a success rate 
for gpcrs  we discovered a potent active compound in of the targets screened a success rate 
overall  we have about a success rate in discovering potent compounds active against some of the industry s most challenging targets 
assay technology 
we employ well and  well microtiter plate screening assays to identify compounds active against biological targets 
these well and  well formats offer significant throughput improvements and cost savings as compared to the industry standard well format 
further  our  well format allows us to perform  at an extremely low cost  a screen of million compounds against a target in under two weeks 
labor required for screening with a  well assay is reduced tenfold as compared to well plates 
production automation 
production automation technology is another important component of our integrated drug discovery approach 
we have developed proprietary instruments and methods for quickly and cost effectively manipulating large numbers of small plastic beads and the compounds that are detached from these beads 
the technology includes proprietary engineering methods and automated systems for placing individual compounds in to  well assays and processing them in preparation for screening 
information systems 
we have developed proprietary software to support our drug discovery activities 
our information systems assist our scientists in managing the extensive data generated during library production and testing 
first  our software integrates the tag set decoding results with the original library design database to quickly provide our scientists with the specific chemical structure and synthesis steps for the active compound 
our information systems also include molecular modeling  structure analysis and statistical programs for designing optimization libraries and software to collect and analyze the results of individual assays 
quality assurance 
our drug discovery approach includes an extensive quality assurance program 
as libraries are synthesized  representative compounds are analyzed at each reaction step to assure that yields are high and compounds are sufficiently pure 
during library production  samples are tested at each reaction step to assure that the tag sets have been satisfactorily attached and can be decoded 
representative compounds are also tested to identify optimal solvents and detachment conditions for removing compounds from beads to perform screening assays 
production plates containing compounds for screening include control samples to further assure that plates to be screened in assays have been prepared appropriately 
our drug discovery collaborations set forth below are our most significant collaborative relationships 
schering plough corporation we began our work with schering plough corporation in  and we expanded the alliance in through a five year agreement under which we created libraries for use by schering plough scientists and assisted in the optimization of potential new therapeutics 
in august  we entered into new multiyear agreements with schering plough 
under the terms of the agreements  we optimize candidates selected for clinical development by schering plough and screen our internal library to identify compounds active against multiple schering plough targets 
if successful  we license the optimized drug candidates on an exclusive basis to schering plough for further development 
with respect to any target we accept from schering plough for screening or optimization work  we have agreed that we will not screen our compound library for other collaborators  or for our own account  against that target for a specified period 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was full time employee fte funding and million was milestone payments  under our research collaboration agreements with schering plough 
payments under our schering plough collaborations since inception in have totaled approximately million  of which approximately million represents investments in our equity securities and milestone payments 
our longstanding research collaborations with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
the planned cessation of fte funding will have no impact on other areas of the collaborations  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in an inflammatory indication and multiple preclinical programs 
we will continue to be entitled to payments resulting from the successful achievement by schering plough  if any  of preclinical and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments from sales  if any  of products resulting from compounds already delivered by us and accepted by schering plough under the collaborations 
we are currently discussing potential partnerships with multiple companies to establish broad  multi year alliances that  consistent with our business strategy  have the potential to provide us with a larger share of product ownership than previous collaborations 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such alliances 
failure to replace the revenue from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition of funding from any new alliances may be different from revenue recognition of funding from the schering plough collaborations 
failure to replace the funding from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
nv organon in february  we entered into a five year drug discovery agreement with nv organon a pharmaceutical business unit of akzo nobel to identify and optimize new drug candidates for multiple therapeutic targets provided by organon 
compounds from our proprietary collection that are screened and optimized and which meet the potency  selectivity  efficacy and other criteria specified by the parties are licensed to organon on an exclusive basis for further development 
in addition  with respect to any target we accept from organon for screening or optimization work  we have agreed that we will not screen our compound library for other collaborators  or for our own account  against that target for a specified period 
in return for our successful drug discovery activities  and meeting certain preclinical and clinical milestones  we are entitled to receive fees and milestone payments from organon 
thereafter  upon successful commercialization of any product resulting from the relationship  we will be entitled to receive royalties on sales of that product 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was fte funding and million was milestones and success fees  under our research collaboration agreements with organon 
payments under our organon collaborations since inception in have totaled approximately million  of which approximately million represents investments in our equity securities and approximately million was milestone and success fee payments 
the agreement with organon has a stated research term of five years 
failure to replace the funding from the organon collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
other relationships we have also entered into research collaboration agreements with numerous other companies  including berlex laboratories  biovitrum ab  bristol myers squibb  cv therapeutics  daiichi pharmaceutical  celgene corporation and neurocrine biosciences 
several of these collaborations  in which we have completed our research activities  may yield us milestone and royalty revenues 
we believe the termination of any one of the active agreements would not have a material adverse effect on us 
marketing our senior management and business development personnel are primarily responsible for marketing our collaborative capabilities and licensing our internal programs 
we market our capabilities directly to customers  typically through meetings with senior management of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and by our participation in trade conferences and partnering meetings 
we also generate new business from customer referrals and through expansion of existing contracts 
competition we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that engage generally in the discovery  development and production of drug discovery products and particularly with those companies that seek to identify and optimize small molecule compounds for potential pharmaceutical development 
we compete with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry companies  and research and academic institutions 
many of these organizations have greater financial and human resources and more experience in research and development than us 
we compete based on a number of factors  including size  relative expertise and sophistication  speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and of developing and optimizing chemical processes 
employees our success depends in part on the continued service of key scientific  business development and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
as of december   we had regular employees  including approximately chemists and biologists  of whom have doctorate level degrees 
none of our employees is covered by collective bargaining agreements 
most of our employees are at will employees  which means that each of them can terminate their relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with them at any time 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
furthermore  we offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction 
intellectual property as of march   we had issued patents in the united states and approximately granted foreign patents relating to various aspects of our intellectual property  including compounds related to our internal or collaborative programs  compound libraries  our molecular tag sets and certain screening technologies 
we either own these patents ourselves or with collaborators or rights under them are licensed to us 
of particular note  we are the exclusive licensee of us patents issued on october   february  and august   which provide broad protection to our use of encoded combinatorial libraries and which expire in we refer you to business our core technology and drug discovery platform eclips technology 
our success will depend in large part on our ability  and the ability of our licensees and licensors  to obtain patents for our technologies and the compounds and other products  if any  resulting from the application of such technologies  defend patents once obtained  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  both in the us and in foreign countries 
government regulation generally  in order to gain approval from the fda  a company must conduct preclinical studies in the laboratory and in animal models to gain preliminary information on a compound s efficacy and to identify any safety problems 
the results of these studies are submitted as a part of an ind that the fda must review prior to the commencement of clinical trials of an investigational drug 
in order to commercialize any products  we or our customer will be required to sponsor and file an ind and will be responsible for initiating and overseeing the clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy that are necessary to obtain fda approval of any such products 
clinical trials are normally done in three sequential phases phase i  phase ii and phase iii that may overlap and generally take two to five years  but may take longer  to complete 
after completion of clinical trials of a new product  fda and foreign regulatory authority marketing approval must be obtained 
if the product is classified as a new drug  we  or our customer  will be required to file an nda and receive approval before commercial marketing of the drug 
even if fda regulatory clearances are obtained  a marketed product is subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
for marketing outside the united states  we will also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
further  our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our activities currently comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
research and development our expense for proprietary research and development activities was as follows in thousands years ended december  the increase in research and development from to is largely due to increased resources expended on our jak program for transplant rejection  and the addition of two new programs  adenosine aa antagonists for parkinson s disease and ccr antagonists for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 
item a 
risk factors as further described herein  our performance and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the following specific risks risks related to our business and industry our revenue is highly concentrated in our two largest collaborators 
the planned cessation of full time employee funding from schering plough or the termination of our collaboration with nv organon would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted  financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the funding from these relationships 
during the year ended year ended december   we earned approximately million  or approximately of our revenue  under our research collaboration agreements with two collaborators  schering plough and nv organon 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was full time employee fte funding and million was milestone payments  under our research collaboration agreements with schering plough  one of our longest standing collaborative partners 
our longstanding research collaborations with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
the planned cessation of fte funding will have no impact on other areas of the collaborations  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in an inflammatory indication and multiple preclinical programs 
we will continue to be entitled to payments resulting from the successful achievement by schering plough  if any  of preclinical and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments from sales  if any  of products resulting from compounds already delivered by us and accepted by schering plough under the collaborations 
we are currently discussing potential partnerships with multiple companies to establish broad  multi year alliances that  consistent with our business strategy  have the potential to provide us with a larger share of product ownership than previous collaborations 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such alliances 
failure to replace the revenue from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition of funding from any new alliances may be different from revenue recognition of funding from the schering plough collaborations 
failure to replace the funding from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately million  or of our revenue  of which million was fte funding and million was milestones and success fees  under our research collaboration agreements with nv organon  our second largest collaborator 
the principal agreement with organon  entered into in february  has a stated research term of five years 
failure to replace the funding from the organon collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
if we consume cash more quickly than expected  we may be unable to raise additional capital and we may be forced to curtail operations 
on july   we entered into purchase agreements to sell an aggregate  shares of newly issued common stock the shares to institutional investors at a price of per share the private placement 
on august   we sold the shares and realized gross proceeds of approximately million from the private placement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement after deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other transaction expenses 
we anticipate that our capital resources  including our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  of approximately million  will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least through however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time 
examples of relevant potential changes in our capital resources include the planned cessation of fte funding from schering plough collaborations in august  changes in other existing collaborative relationships  particularly with organon  including the funding we receive in connection with those relationships  the costs associated with our drug discovery and development activities  acquisitions of other businesses  product candidates or technologies  penalties we may be required to pay the purchasers in the private placement if we fail to comply with certain covenants and obligations related to that transaction  the purchase of additional capital equipment  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the outcome of related litigation  and the progress of our milestone and royalty producing activities 
we intend to raise additional capital 
the capital could be raised through public or private financings involving debt or common or other classes of our equity 
any issuance of equity securities would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership of us 
as of december   there were stock options outstanding to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock and approximately  shares of unvested restricted stock issued under our various equity compensation plans 
these equity instruments represent approximately of our shares outstanding at december  the significant dilution represented by our outstanding equity compensation awards may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
the development of our internal and collaborative products is at an early stage and is uncertain 
drug development is a highly uncertain process 
our approach and technology may never result in a commercial drug 
none of our programs has resulted in products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
as of december   none of our internal programs had advanced into clinical trials ie  human testing 
currently our collaborators have advanced three programs comprised of four compounds into clinical trials 
all of our therapeutic candidates  including these clinical candidates  face the substantial risks of failure inherent in the drug development process 
any potential pharmaceutical product emanating from one of our internal or collaborative programs must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign regulatory authorities will approve them for commercial use 
to satisfy these standards  significant additional research  preclinical studies ie  animal testing and clinical trials will be required 
our internal and collaborative programs are in early stages relative to generating a commercial product 
therefore  we and our collaborators must engage in significant  time consuming and costly research and development efforts followed by our and our collaborators applications for and receipt of  regulatory approvals 
consequently  we do not expect compounds from these development activities to result in commercially available products for many years  if at all 
our business is highly dependent upon the extent to which the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries collaborate with drug discovery and development companies for one or more aspects of their drug discovery and development process 
our revenue depends to a large extent on research and development expenditures by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
our capabilities include aspects of the drug discovery and development process that pharmaceutical companies have traditionally performed internally 
although there is a history among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of outsourcing drug research and development functions  this practice may not continue 
the willingness of these companies to expand or continue collaborations to enhance their research and development activities is based on certain factors that are beyond our control 
while we are unaware of a specific reason that any of the following factors will have a material impact on the willingness of current or potential collaborators to expand or continue collaborations  examples of relevant factors include collaborators changing spending priorities among various types of research activities  the increased presence of offshore companies that conduct research and have lower fte costs than ours  their ability to hire and retain qualified scientists  their approach regarding expenditures during recessionary periods and their policies regarding the balance of research expenditures versus cost containment 
also  general economic downturns in our collaborators industries  adverse changes in the regulatory environment  the adverse impact of product litigation on our collaborators businesses or any decrease in our research and development expenditures could harm our operations  as could increased popularity of management theories  which counsel against outsourcing of critical business functions 
continued consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may further decrease the number of potential collaborators for us 
in addition  the popularity of scientific thinking that disfavors elements of our technology platform  such as large diverse libraries  could negatively impact our business 
any decrease in drug discovery spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could cause our revenue to decline 
our ability to collaborate with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will depend on many factors  including our ability to discover and develop high quality drug candidates  identify and utilize scientists and technologies that are of the highest caliber  and achieve results in a timely fashion  with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
the importance of these factors varies from collaborator to collaborator  and we may be unable to meet any or all of them for some or all of our collaborators in the future 
if our collaborators are not able to successfully develop our existing clinical candidates  our business will be harmed 
our collaborators  bristol myers squibb company  daiichi pharmaceutical co 
and schering plough corporation  currently are performing clinical trials of prospective pharmaceutical products containing our proprietary compounds 
in each case  the collaborator is responsible for the development of these potential products  the level of resources devoted to such development and the decision as to when  or whether  such development should cease 
numerous additional studies are necessary to support the further development of these product candidates 
results from preclinical studies conducted to date on these product candidates are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be obtained in clinical studies 
clinical results could cause our collaborators to discontinue or limit development of these product candidates 
for example  in november  schering plough informed us that it discontinued the phase i clinical trials it commenced in december for the clinical compound targeting a respiratory indication  which was developed from leads from our collaboration with schering plough 
there can be no assurance that bristol myers squibb  daiichi or schering plough will continue to develop the current clinical programs 
in addition  our collaborators may pursue alternative technologies or drug candidates  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that compete with the clinical candidates on which they collaborate with us 
if our collaborators do not continue their development efforts or if such efforts do not result in positive clinical results  we will not receive additional milestone and royalty payments from those efforts  and our business will be harmed 
our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
the market price for our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
during the year ended december  the closing price was per share at its low point in november and per share at its high point in january our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets  and other developments affecting our competitors or us could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
while we are unaware of a specific reason that any of the following factors will have a material impact on our stock price  the following factors  in addition to the factors described in the other risk factors contained in this report  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock publicity concerning the status of potential drug products under development by us or our collaborators or our competitors and their partners  reduction  termination or expiration of our collaborations  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  litigation  economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises  actual or anticipated period to period fluctuations in our financial results  changes in financial estimates prepared by securities analysts  differences in the valuations assigned by the equity markets and  in particular  the biopharmaceutical sector of the equity markets  to biopharmaceutical companies like us that have more drug discovery than drug development capabilities  and the general performance of the equity markets and  in particular  the biopharmaceutical sector of the equity markets 
we had net losses in recent years  and our future profitability is uncertain 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we had net losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the net loss for the year ended december  was due to increased corporate overhead costs  severance costs and our increased focus on internal research and development 
the net loss for the fiscal year ended december  included restructuring and other charges of million 
our longstanding research collaboration with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
in addition  under the principal agreement with organon  the research term expires in february failure to replace the revenue from our collaborations with schering plough and organon would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the adoption of the financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period after december  on a quarterly basis  our future operating results are likely to be highly volatile depending upon our receipt of milestone payments from our collaborators 
we may not receive milestone payments on a regular basis or at all 
our ability to achieve profitability  if ever  will be significantly impacted by the level of investment we determine to make in our internal proprietary programs in the future as well as the results of those programs 
continuing net losses may limit our ability to fund our operations  and we may not generate income from operations in the future 
disputes may arise between our partners and us as to royalties and milestones to which we believe we are entitled 
the compound basis for drugs developed by a partner may be a derivative or optimized version of the compound screened or optimized by us 
while our existing collaborative agreements provide that we will receive milestone payments and royalties with respect to certain products developed from certain derivative compounds  there can be no assurance that disputes will not arise over the application of payment provisions to such products 
there can be no assurance that current or future partners will not pursue alternative technologies  or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments based on the targets which are the subject of the collaborative arrangements with us 
in addition  many of our agreements that provide for potential royalty payments to us also contain provisions that reduce our expected royalty if a partner is also required to pay a royalty on a product to a third party 
we may not successfully enter into additional collaborations that allow us to participate in the future success of our product candidates through milestone  royalty and or license payments  and we may never receive any milestone  royalty and or license payments under our current or any future collaborations 
one of our business strategies is to expand our proprietary pipeline of drug candidates and to then enter into collaborations for the development of these drug candidates that will allow us to earn milestone  royalty and or license payments or otherwise share in commercialization 
our proprietary drug discovery program is in its early stage of development and is unproven 
although we have expended  and continue to expend  time and money on internal research and development programs  we may be unsuccessful in creating valuable proprietary drug candidates that would enable us to form additional collaborations and receive milestone  royalty and or license payments 
our collaborations and internal programs may not result in the discovery of potential drug candidates that will be safe or effective 
although we have received license and milestone fees to date  we may never receive any royalty payments  or any additional license and milestone fees  under our current or any future collaborations 
our receipt of any future milestone  royalty or license payments depends on many factors  including whether our collaborators desire to or are able to continue to pursue a potential drug candidate and the ultimate commercial success of the drug 
development and commercialization of potential drug candidates depend not only on the achievement of research objectives by our collaborators and us  but also on each collaborator s financial  competitive  marketing and strategic considerations and regulation in the united states and other countries 
if unforeseen complications arise in the development or commercialization of the potential drug candidates by our collaborators  we may not realize milestone  royalty or license payments 
the drug research and development industry is highly competitive and subject to technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to compete successfully 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
moreover  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by continuous technological innovation 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and our competitors make advanced technologies available 
technological advances or entirely different approaches that we or one or more of our competitors develop may render our products  services and expertise obsolete or uneconomical 
additionally  the existing approaches of our competitors or new approaches or technologies that our competitors develop may be more effective than those we develop 
we may not be able to compete successfully with existing or future competitors 
if we cannot manage the multiple relationships and interests involved in our collaborative arrangements and internal programs  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we may need to successfully structure and manage multiple internal programs and collaborative relationships  including maintaining confidentiality of the research being performed for multiple collaborators 
we may be unable to successfully manage conflicts between competing drug development programs of third parties to which we offer services 
from time to time  more than one of our collaborators may want to perform research concerning the same or molecularly similar disease targets 
because of that  we may be required to reconcile our relationships with those collaborators  particularly if both want to establish exclusive relationships with us with respect to that target or if one collaborator has an existing arrangement with us and the other would like us to perform services regarding a target restricted by that arrangement 
further  if we are working with a collaborator regarding a particular target  another of our collaborators may be researching the same target in one of its internal programs of which we have no knowledge 
as a result  potential conflicts involving us may arise due to this competition between collaborators in a particular disease field of interest 
conflicts also may arise between our collaborators as to proprietary rights to particular compounds in our libraries or as to proprietary rights to biological targets such as receptors or enzymes against which we screen compounds in our libraries 
the occurrence of conflicts  or the perception of conflicts  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates laws  we may be liable for damages 
our activities involve the use of potentially harmful hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
these materials are utilized in the performance of our assay development  high throughput screening and chemistry optimization services  and include common organic solvents  such as acetone  hexane  methylene chloride  acetonitrile  and isopropyl and methyl alcohol  as well as common acids and bases 
the waste from utilization of these solvents and other materials is disposed of through licensed third party contractors 
further  we utilize an extremely wide variety of chemicals in the performance of our assay development  screening and optimization services 
these chemicals  such as reagents  buffers and inorganic salts  typically are employed in extremely small amounts in connection with the work performed in our laboratories 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use  storage  handling or disposal of these materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages that result 
we maintain insurance coverage against environmental hazards arising from the storage and disposal of the materials utilized in our business 
although our management believes that such insurance has terms  including coverage limits  which are appropriate for our business  liabilities arising from the use  storage  handling or disposal of these materials could exceed our insurance coverage as well as our resources 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant 
to our knowledge  we have not been  and currently are not  the subject of any governmental investigation concerning the violation of these federal  state and local laws and regulations 
there can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of future investigations by governmental authorities 
we and our products are subject to strict government regulation  which may limit the development of products by us or our collaborators 
regulation by governmental entities in the united states and other countries will be a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products our collaborators or we may develop 
the nature and the extent to which government regulation may apply to our collaborators and us will vary depending on the nature of the pharmaceutical products  if any 
virtually all pharmaceutical products require regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
if we or our collaborators or licensees fail to obtain  or encounter delays in obtaining or maintaining  regulatory approvals  our financial results could be adversely affected 
similar regulatory procedures are required in countries outside the united states 
in addition  new legislation related to health care could reduce the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell which  in turn  could reduce the amounts that they have available for collaborative relationships with us 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs  the number of collaborations we conclude could be adversely impacted and our revenue and profitability reduced 
if prices that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell decrease  the royalties  if any  we receive from the sale of products would also decrease  which would reduce our revenue and profitability 
failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect us 
we are a small company  and our success depends in part on the continued service of key scientific and management personnel  including our president and chief executive officer leslie j 
browne  phd  and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel 
immigration laws may further restrict our ability to attract or hire qualified personnel 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our growth and development 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we are highly dependent on the principal members of our scientific and management staff 
one or more of these key employees could retire or otherwise leave our employ within the foreseeable future  and the loss of any of these people could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not  and do not intend to  maintain key person life insurance on the life of any employee 
some of our development and marketing activities are  or will be  conducted by third parties 
if these third parties fail to perform their functions satisfactorily  our revenue and earnings could be delayed  reduced or eliminated 
the ultimate success of our business plan heavily depends upon the successful discovery  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
our endeavors will result in commercialized pharmaceutical products  if at all  only after significant preclinical and clinical development  requisite regulatory approvals  establishment of manufacturing capabilities and successful marketing 
we do not currently have the technology  facilities  personnel or experience to accomplish all of these tasks on our own  and we will likely not have all the necessary resources in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we continue to depend heavily upon the expertise and dedication of sufficient resources by partners to develop and commercialize products primarily based on lead compounds discovered by us 
if a partner fails to develop or commercialize a compound or product with respect to which it has rights from us  we may not receive any future milestone payments or royalties associated with that compound or product 
similarly  while we are unaware of a specific reason that any of the following factors will be experienced by our strategic collaborators  because we rely heavily on them  our revenue could be adversely affected if our collaborators terminate their alliances or arrangements with us  fail to select a target or product candidate we have identified for subsequent development  fail to gain the requisite regulatory approvals for product candidates  do not successfully commercialize products based on the compounds that we originate  do not conduct their collaborative activities in a timely manner  do not devote sufficient time or resources to our partnered programs or potential products  develop  either alone or with others  products that may compete with our product candidates  dispute our respective allocations of rights to any products or technology developed during our collaborations  or merge with or are acquired by a third party that seeks to terminate our collaboration 
we are subject to risks associated with the operation of an international business 
in the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was derived from customers outside the united states 
during that period  approximately of our revenue was derived from customers in europe  and approximately was derived from customers in the asia pacific region 
we anticipate that international revenue will continue to account for a significant percentage of our overall revenue 
while we are unaware of a specific reason that any of the following factors will have a material impact on our revenue  our international operations are subject to the risk factors inherent in the conduct of international business  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer payment cycles  import and export license requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in collecting trade receivables  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign joint venture operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we may not be able to sustain or increase our international revenue 
any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize revenue from our business development efforts 
our collaborative relationships involve lengthy negotiation cycles  often requiring us to expend considerable financial and personnel resources without any assurance that revenue will be recognized 
these cycles typically are long for a number of reasons 
factors include the strategic nature of our partnerships  the size of many such transactions  the confidential and proprietary nature of the biological targets against which we screen our chemical compound libraries  and the unique terms typically found in each of the transactions 
as a result  we may expend substantial funds and effort to negotiate agreements for collaborative arrangements  but may ultimately be unable to complete the transaction and recognize revenue 
in these circumstances  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our primary facilities 
we depend on our laboratories and equipment for the continued operation of our business 
our research and development operations and administrative functions are primarily conducted at our facilities in the princeton  new jersey area 
although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events  catastrophic events could still disrupt our operations 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event in our facilities or the areas in which they are located could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of your investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its price 
anti takeover provisions under section of the delaware general corporation law  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may render more difficult the accomplishment of mergers or the assumption of control by a principal stockholder  making more difficult the removal of management 
section of the delaware general corporation law may delay or deter attempts to secure control of our company without the consent of our management 
in general  section prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain several provisions that could delay or make more difficult the acquisition of our company through a hostile tender offer  open market purchases  proxy contest  merger or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in his or her best interest  including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock 
such provisions include the issuance of preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock  the classification of our board of directors  the election and removal of directors  restrictions on the ability of stockholders to take action without a meeting  restrictions on stockholders ability to call a special meeting and advance notice procedures regarding any proposal of stockholder business to be discussed at a stockholders meeting 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which is triggered upon commencement or announcement of a hostile tender offer or when any one person or group acquires or more of our common stock 
the rights plan  once triggered  enables stockholders to purchase our common stock at reduced prices 
these provisions of our governing documents  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control  including without limitation a proxy contest  making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
further  the existence of these anti takeover measures may cause potential bidders to look elsewhere  rather than initiating acquisition discussions with us 
if we engage in an acquisition or business combination  we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders 
from time to time we have considered  and we will continue to consider in the future  if and when any appropriate opportunities become available  strategic business initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
these initiatives may include acquiring products  businesses or technologies or entering into a business combination with another company 
if we do pursue such a strategy  we could  among other things issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations  spend substantial operational  financial and management resources in integrating new businesses  technologies and products  assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities  or merge with  or otherwise enter into a business combination with  another company in which our stockholders would receive cash or shares of the other company or a combination of both on terms that our stockholders may not deem desirable 
we are not in a position to predict what  if any  collaborations  alliances or other transactions may result or how  when or if these activities would have a material effect on us or the development of our business 
risks related to establishing our company as independent from accelrys we have agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the tax treatment of the distribution  which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility 
accelrys obtained an opinion from dechert llp  its counsel  to the effect that the april  dividend distribution of shares of our common stock qualifies as a transaction that is generally tax free under sections and or a d of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to accelrys but not to its stockholders if we engage in  or enter into an agreement to engage in  a transaction that would result in a percent or greater change by vote or by value in our stock ownership during the four year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the distribution date  unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the distribution 
temporary us treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a distribution are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances  including but not limited to those specific factors listed in the regulations 
in addition  the regulations provide several safe harbors for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan 
we and accelrys have entered into a tax sharing agreement under which we have made certain covenants to each other in connection with the distribution that we may not take certain actions without first obtaining an unqualified opinion of counsel or an internal revenue service ruling that such actions will not cause the distribution to become taxable 
pursuant to these covenants  generally we will  for two years after the distribution date  continue the active conduct of the drug discovery business  we will not repurchase our stock except in certain circumstances permitted by the internal revenue service  we will not take any actions inconsistent with the representations made in connection with the issuance by dechert llp of its opinion with respect to the distribution  and we will not take or fail to take any other action that would result in any tax being imposed on the distribution 
accelrys may seek an injunction to enforce these covenants 
these restrictions could substantially limit our strategic and operational flexibility  including our ability to finance our operations by issuing equity securities  to make acquisitions using equity securities  to repurchase our equity securities  to raise money by selling assets  or to enter into business combination transactions 
we have agreed to indemnify accelrys for taxes and related losses resulting from any actions we take that cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a tax free transaction 
we have agreed to indemnify accelrys for any taxes and related losses including any applicable interest and penalties  all related accounting  legal and other professional fees  all related court costs and all costs  expenses and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies and any amount paid in respect of the liability of stockholders resulting from a breach of any of the covenants described above 
furthermore  we will be responsible for taxes that may be imposed upon accelrys pursuant to section e of the code in connection with a transaction that results in a change in control of us  even though we will have obtained an internal revenue service ruling or an unqualified opinion of counsel prior to the transaction 
the amount of any indemnification payments could be substantial 
the amount of accelrys taxes for which we are agreeing to indemnify accelrys will be based on the excess of the aggregate fair market value of our stock as of the april  distribution date over the accelrys tax basis in our stock 
we may be required to indemnify accelrys  or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from accelrys 
under the terms of the master separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that we entered into with accelrys  we and accelrys agreed to indemnify one another from and after the distribution with respect to the indebtedness  liabilities and obligations retained by our respective companies 
these indemnification obligations could be significant 
our ability to satisfy any such indemnification obligations will depend upon the future financial strength of our company 
we cannot determine whether we will have to indemnify accelrys for any substantial obligations 
we also cannot assure you that  if accelrys becomes obligated to indemnify us for any substantial obligations  accelrys will have the ability to satisfy those obligations 
any payment by accelrys or us pursuant to these indemnification provisions could have a material adverse effect on the payor s business 
any failure by accelrys or us to satisfy its indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on the other company s business 
certain risks related to intellectual property positions taken by the us patent and trademark office or us patent and trademark officials may preclude us from obtaining sufficient or timely protection for our intellectual property 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
there is a significant risk that the scope of a patent may not be sufficient to prevent third parties from marketing other products or technologies with the same functionality of our products and technologies 
consequently  some or all of our patent applications may not issue into patents  and any issued patents may provide ineffective remedies or be challenged or circumvented 
third parties may have filed patent applications of which we may or may not have knowledge  and which may adversely affect our business 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for months from filing or until a patent issues 
under certain circumstances  patent applications are never published but remain in secrecy until issuance 
as a result  others may have filed patent applications for products or technology covered by one or more pending patent applications upon which we are relying 
if applications covering similar technologies were to be filed before our applications  our patent applications may not be granted 
there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property or information relevant to our chemical compositions and other technologies that are not known to us  that block us or compete with our chemical compositions or other technologies  or limit the scope of patent protection available to us 
moreover  from time to time  patents may issue which block or compete with our chemical compositions or other technologies  or limit the scope of patent protection available to us 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may not be able to protect adequately the trade secrets and confidential information that we disclose to our employees 
we rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
competitors through their independent discovery or improper means  such as unauthorized disclosure or industrial espionage may come to know our proprietary information 
we generally require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements 
these agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed by or made known to the employee or consultant during his  her or its relationship with us are to be kept confidential  and that all inventions arising out of the employee s relationship with us are our exclusive property 
our employees and consultants may breach these agreements  and in some instances we may not have an adequate remedy 
additionally  in some instances  we may have failed to require that employees and consultants execute confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements 
foreign laws may not afford us sufficient protections for our intellectual property  and we may not seek patent protection outside the united states 
we believe that our success depends  in part  upon our ability to obtain international protection for our intellectual property 
however  the laws of some foreign countries may not be as comprehensive as those of the united states and may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights abroad 
in addition  we may decide not to pursue patent protection outside the united states because of cost and confidentiality concerns 
accordingly  our international competitors could obtain foreign patent protection for  and market overseas  products and technologies for which we are seeking us patent protection and they may be able to use these products and technologies to compete against us 
we may not be able to adequately defend our intellectual property from third party infringement  and third party challenges to our intellectual property may adversely affect our rights and be costly and time consuming 
some of our competitors have  or are affiliated with companies having  substantially greater resources than we have  and those competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than us 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any patent or related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace pending resolution of the disputed matters 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs to us  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
similarly  opposition proceedings may occur overseas  which may result in the loss or narrowing of the scope of claims or legal rights 
such proceedings will at least result in delay in the issuance of enforceable claims 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to license disputed rights from third parties or cease using the technology 
a patent issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect adequately our rights in intellectual property to which the patent relates 
even if patents are issued to us  these patents may not sufficiently protect our interest in our chemical compositions or other technologies because the scope of protection provided by any patents issued to or licensed by us are subject to the uncertainties inherent in patent law 
third parties may be able to design around these patents or develop unique products providing effects similar to our products 
in addition  others may discover uses for our chemical compositions or technologies other than those uses covered in our patents  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and research and academic institutions  have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents on various technologies that may be related to our business 
some of these technologies  patent applications or patents may conflict with our technologies  patent applications or patents 
these conflicts could also limit the scope of patents  if any  that we may be able to obtain  or result in the denial of our patent applications 
we are not currently aware of any such patent applications or patents that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be subject to claims of infringement by third parties 
third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
in addition  to the extent our employees are involved in research areas similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers  we may be subject to claims that one of our employees  or we  have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of a former employer 
from time to time  we have received letters claiming or suggesting that our products or activities may infringe third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
our products may infringe patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
a number of patents may have been issued or may be issued in the future that could cover certain aspects of our technology and that could prevent us from using technology that we use or expect to use 
we may be required to seek licenses for  or otherwise acquire rights to  technology as a result of claims of infringement 
we may not possess proper ownership or access rights to the intellectual property we use 
third parties or other companies may bring infringement suits against us 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us  our failure or inability to license or design around the infringed technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are not currently involved in actions of this type that are material to our business

business overview our mission is to create and deliver novel therapeutics to address significant medical needs 
using proprietary technologies and processes  we seek to identify  optimize and develop novel drug candidates through our own internally funded drug discovery programs and in collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our collaborative research efforts have resulted in a portfolio of three partnered programs comprised of four compounds that have been advanced into human clinical trials  with six additional programs in preclinical development 
we have four internal programs in advanced discovery in addition to multiple partnered programs in discovery 
we are building expertise and extending our capabilities into preclinical and clinical development so that we can advance both internal and partnered programs into preclinical and clinical development 
our internal proprietary research programs are primarily focused on immunobiology and immunological diseases 
we fully fund these programs and retain intellectual property and ownership rights to any compounds discovered 
our proprietary research and development expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
at an appropriate point  we may license one or more of these compounds or programs to a partner probably a larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology organization 
in contrast to many of our partnering efforts in the past  we now seek to establish alliances which are broad in scope and multi year in term to deliver compounds that are more mature than in the past  ideally compounds that are clinical candidates  as opposed to hits or leads 
as a result of delivering later stage compounds  which are of greater value  we will seek to retain a larger share of ownership as represented by increased royalties on net sales that may result from the program advancing to the market in the compound 
additionally  we will  where appropriate  evolve the collaborative model by offering to reduce our research fees in exchange for greater milestone and royalty commitments from the partner 
this strategy  coupled with the cessation of the full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations in august and the possible expiration of the research term under the organon collaboration in february  may result in an increase in our near term operating losses 
to date  our collaborative drug discovery efforts have resulted in three partnered therapeutic programs  that are currently in phase i clinical trials 
in addition to the compounds in the clinic  six more programs are at various stages of preclinical development  the point at which compounds are tested for safety in animals prior to filing an ind application and their exposure to humans during phase i of clinical development 
preclinical and clinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
we continue to pursue the discovery and development of product candidates using our integrated technology platform in both our internal and collaborative programs 
the drug candidates described above are at an early stage  and none has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
both our partnered clinical candidates and our internally derived compounds face the substantial risk of failure inherent in drug discovery and development 
at any stage of the clinical development process  our collaborators  or we  may decide to discontinue development of our product candidates 
to date  none of the compounds to which we hold complete or partial rights has reached the stage of a commercial product and  although we have received license and milestone fees  we may never receive any royalty payments  or any additional license and milestone fees  under our current or any future collaborations 
we do not expect that our product candidates will be commercially available for many years  if ever 
from time to time we have considered  and we will continue to consider strategic initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
in addition  we consider opportunities to expand our product pipeline through the acquisition or in licensing of  or investment in  product development candidates  and we intend to continue to explore and evaluate those opportunities 
executive overview of financial results during  we continued to implement our strategy to increase our investment in internal programs  while continuing to recognize revenue from our collaborative research and development partners 
we are transferring an increasing percentage of our resources from collaborative projects to internal projects 
below are some financial results for our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased from million at december  to million at december  our net cash used in operating activities increased to million during the year ended december  from million during year ended december  we raised net proceeds of million in a private placement of shares of our common stock 
net revenue decreased to million from million  a decrease of 
this decrease was due to reduced funding from our collaborations with schering plough and lower milestone revenue 
we are planning for fte funding from the schering plough collaborations to cease in august failure to replace the revenue from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition of funding from any new alliances may be different from revenue recognition of funding from the schering plough collaborations 
failure to replace the funding from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
our proprietary research and development expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
we now have multiple internal programs in advanced late stage preclinical optimization focused primarily on immunobiology and immunological diseases 
we recognized a net loss of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources prior to our spin off from accelrys in april  we had funded our activities primarily through accelrys consolidated operations  including revenue derived from collaborative partnerships and milestone payments 
accelrys contributed cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities such that upon consummation of the spin off  we had a cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance aggregating million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million at december   representing and of our total assets  respectively 
we invest excess cash in highly liquid investment grade marketable securities  including corporate bonds and united states government and agency securities 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the years ended december  and years ended december  net loss adjustments for noncash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities net cash operating outflows for the year ended december  have resulted primarily from our operating loss due to our funding of our proprietary internal drug discovery efforts  the payment of restructuring expenses related to the consolidation of our facilities and the payment to columbia and cold spring of thousand in connection with the settlement of a dispute with them 
net cash operating outflows for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our operating loss due to our decrease in revenue  our increase in the funding of our internal drug discovery efforts  and increase sales  general and administrative costs 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  relates primarily to the net sales and maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by capital expenditures for research and development and information technology equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  related primarily to the net sales and maturities of marketable securities  partially offset by capital expenditures for leasehold improvements in connection with the consolidation of our facilities to one location 
net cash provided by financing activities on july   we entered into purchase agreements to sell an aggregate of  shares of newly issued common stock the shares to institutional investors at a price of per share the private placement 
on august   we sold the shares and realized gross proceeds of approximately million from the private placement 
we realized net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement after deducting fees payable to the placement agent and other transaction expenses 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  also consists of a capital contribution made to us by accelrys for certain costs associated with updating our website and the consolidation of our facilities  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with exercises of stock options and sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of a capital contribution made to us by accelrys upon the distribution and proceeds from the from the issuance of common stock in connection with exercises of stock options and sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years after years in thousands contractual obligations operating leases occupied facilities unoccupied facility related to restructuring total operating lease obligations columbia university and cold spring harbor laboratory licensing agreement other restructuring costs total we are obligated to pay approximately million annually in costs in connection with the facilities we currently occupy 
the leases on these facilities expire in we are obligated to pay approximately million in rent and million in operating costs in connection with a facility we exited in the first quarter of the lease on this facility expires in april we have a license agreement with columbia university  or columbia  and cold spring harbor laboratory  or cold spring  that grants us an exclusive  worldwide license to certain technology for making and using combinatorial chemical libraries for the development of human pharmaceutical products 
the agreement ends on the later of i july  or ii the expiration of the last patent relating to the technology  at which time we will have a fully paid license to the technology 
the license granted under this agreement may be terminated by columbia and cold spring i upon days written notice to us if we do not expend certain amount of money developing and commercializing the combinatorial chemical libraries  ii upon days written notice to us if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure the material breach  or iii if we commit any act of bankruptcy  become insolvent  file a petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency act or have a petition filed against us that is not dismissed within days 
this agreement requires us to pay minimum annual fees and certain royalties of at least thousand per year 
due to the uncertainty of our future payment obligations  we have included in the table above only the minimum annual fee required by the agreement and our obligation to pay thousand in in connection with a settlement of a dispute between us and columbia and cold spring 
in  and we paid related royalties and license fees of approximately thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
we maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and members of the board of directors 
under the employee matters agreement entered into at the time of our spin off from accelrys  effective as of april   we assumed all liabilities of our current and former employees under the deferred compensation plan 
the employee matters agreement also provided that the assets relating to the current and former employees under the deferred compensation plan would be transferred to us or a rabbi trust designated by us as soon as practicable following the effective date of the spin off 
we received these assets in the total deferred compensation plan obligation as of december  is approximately million 
this amount has not been included in the table above  as the obligation dates are governed by the applicable employee s termination or retirement  and therefore the timing of such payments is indeterminable 
pursuant to the purchase agreements executed in connection with the private placement we agreed to file a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the commission to register the resale of the shares 
the registration statement on form s was declared effective on august  in addition  we agreed to use our best efforts  subject to receipt of necessary information from the purchasers  to keep the registration statement effective until the earlier of i years after the effective date of the registration statement or ii the date on which the shares become eligible for resale pursuant to rule k under the securities act of  as amended the securities act the effectiveness period 
if i the registration statement ceases to be effective as to all the shares to which it is required to relate at any time prior to the expiration of the effectiveness period without being succeeded within trading days by an amendment to such registration statement or by a subsequent registration statement filed with and declared effective by the commission  or ii our common stock is not listed or quoted  or is suspended from trading on  the nasdaq national market or the facilities of any national securities exchange on which the common stock is then traded for a period of trading days any such failure or breach being referred to as an event  and the date on which such event occurs being referred to as event date  then x on each such event date we shall pay to each purchaser an amount in cash  as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty  equal to of the aggregate purchase price paid by such purchaser pursuant to the purchase agreements  and y on each monthly anniversary of each such event date until the applicable event is cured  we shall pay to each purchaser an amount in cash  as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty  equal to of the aggregate purchase price paid by such purchaser pursuant to the purchase agreements 
the purchase agreements provide that such payments shall not constitute the purchasers exclusive remedy for such events 
if we fail to pay any such liquidated damages in full within days after the date payable  we will pay interest thereon at a rate of per annum or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law to the purchasers  accruing daily from the date such liquidated damages are due until such amounts  plus all such interest thereon  are paid in full 
liquidity and capital resources outlook we expect to continue to use our capital to fund operating losses 
we expect that our research and development expenditures will increase in the future as we increase our internal drug discovery efforts 
conducting our own drug discovery research is a key component of our business model 
in addition  our capital requirements may increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances  or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least through however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue and extend existing collaborative agreements and to enter into additional arrangements 
approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  was generated from our collaborations with schering plough and nv organon 
our longstanding research collaborations with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
the planned cessation of fte funding will have no impact on other areas of the collaborations  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in an inflammatory indication and multiple preclinical programs 
we will continue to be entitled to payments resulting from the successful achievement by schering plough  if any  of preclinical and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments from sales  if any  of products resulting from compounds already delivered by us and accepted by schering plough under the collaborations 
we are currently discussing potential partnerships with multiple companies to establish broad  multi year alliances that  consistent with our business strategy  have the potential to provide us with a larger share of product ownership than previous collaborations 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such alliances 
failure to replace the funding from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
the principal agreement with organon  entered into in february  has a stated research term of five years 
failure to replace the funding from the organon collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our business as it is currently conducted and our financial condition 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 
in addition  our capital requirements depend on competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the outcome of related litigation  the purchase of additional capital equipment  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  and the progress of our collaborators milestone and royalty producing activities 
prior to exhausting our current capital resources  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our operating activities or enter into strategic initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecasts of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations are forward looking information  and actual results could vary 
the factors described earlier in this section will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
compared to our net revenue decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  net revenue consists of the funding of our collaborative research activities  as well as our receipt of milestones  success fees and license revenue if and as our discoveries progress through our collaborators development processes 
net revenue for the year ended december  and is summarized as follows for the years ended december  collaborative research funding milestones  success fees and license revenue schering plough accounted for and of our net revenue in the year ended december  and  respectively  including million and million of our milestones and success fee revenue recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
nv organon accounted for and of our net revenue in the year ended december  and  respectively  including million and of the milestone payments and success fees revenue recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in collaborative research funding in was largely due to reduced funding from our collaboration with schering plough and the expiration of other collaborative research and development agreements 
collaborative research and development expense includes the labor  material  equipment and allocated facilities cost of our scientific staff that is working on collaborative partnerships 
collaborative research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease was due to decreased resources allocated to our collaborative partnerships largely due to the reduced staffing on our collaboration with schering plough and the expiration of other collaborative research and development agreements 
proprietary research and development expense includes labor  material  equipment and allocated facilities cost of scientific staff working on self funded internal drug discovery programs 
using proprietary technologies and processes  we discover and develop novel drug candidates to advance internally as well as with strategic partners 
we currently have several internal programs in advanced preclinical optimization 
proprietary research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was largely due to increased resources expended on our jak program for transplant rejection  and the addition of two new programs  adenosine aa antagonists for parkinson s disease and ccr antagonists for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis 
because of the speculative nature of these internal drug discovery projects  it is not possible to estimate completion dates  or estimated costs of completion 
additionally  from time to time  certain staff and other research and development resources may be temporarily redirected from one project to another which redirection may also delay or impact the cost of internal drug discovery projects 
sales  general and administrative expense increased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to the severance payable to two of our former executives 
in connection with our severance cash payment obligations we recorded a charge of approximately million in the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million related to the accelerated vesting of the executives stock compensation 
also contributing to the increase were additional costs associated with our being an independent company  including salary and expenses for executive management  finance  legal  human resources  information services  investor relations  and corporate governance 
prior to the distribution  general corporate overhead had been allocated based on our revenue as a percentage of accelrys total revenue 
this increase was offset by the moving costs incurred in the year ended december  in connection with the consolidation of our facilities and a charge of million in connection with a dispute with columbia and cold spring also recorded in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we executed a restructuring plan for the purpose of consolidating our research and development facilities 
as a result  restructuring related charges of million were accrued and recognized as operating expense during the year ended december  interest and other income  net increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this increase is due to higher average cash balances and yields 
we recorded an income tax benefit of thousand and thousand in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the sale of some of our state net operating losses offset by minimum and state income taxes 
as a result of the net revenues and expenses described above  we generated a net loss of million per basic and diluted share in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million per basic and diluted share in the year ended december  compared to our net revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net revenue consists of the funding of our research activities  as well as our receipt of milestones  success fees and license revenue if and as our discoveries progress through the development process 
net revenue for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows for the years ended december  collaborative research funding milestones  success fees and license revenue the decrease in collaborative research funding was primarily due to reduced revenue from our collaborations with schering plough  the expiration of one of our collaborations with nv organon  the expiration of a lead optimization agreement with progenics  and the significant reduction in our screening services activities with novartis 
in and  schering plough accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
in and  nv organon accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
collaborative research and development expense includes the labor  material  equipment and allocated facilities cost of our scientific staff that are working on collaborative partnerships 
collaborative research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a reduction in research and development efforts in optimization and screening programs and reduced allocated facility costs 
proprietary research and development expense includes labor  material  equipment and allocated facilities cost of scientific staff working on unfunded internal drug discovery programs 
our internal drug discovery projects are focused on the creation of new small molecule therapeutics using proprietary technologies and our proprietary collection of compounds to identify and optimize novel drug candidates 
because of the speculative nature of these internal drug discovery projects  it is not possible to estimate completion dates  or estimated costs of completion 
additionally  from time to time  depending on requirements under collaborative partnership work  certain staff and other research and development resources may be temporarily redirected to collaborative partnership work which redirection may also delay or impact the cost of internal drug discovery projects 
consistent with our strategy  to increase our investment in internal drug discovery programs  research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  sales  general and administrative expense increased by to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to additional costs associated with our being an independent company  including salary and expenses for executive management  finance  legal  human resources  information services  investor relations  and corporate governance 
prior to the distribution  general corporate overhead had been allocated based on our revenue as a percentage of accelrys s total revenue 
the increase in sales  general and administrative is also due to moving costs incurred in the consolidation of our research and development facilities and the recording of an accrual for the probable cost estimated by management to resolve a dispute with columbia and cold spring 
during the year ended december   we undertook a restructuring and certain other actions 
accordingly  restructuring and other charges of million were incurred 
the charges included severance payments  the cost to exit a leased facility  and the acceleration of a deferred compensation charge 
interest and other income net increased to thousand for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the year ended december  this increase is due to significantly higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances due to the capital contribution from accelrys at the time of the distribution 
we recorded an income tax benefit for the year ended december  related to the sale of our state net operating losses  partially offset by minimum state income taxes 
the provision for the year ended december  included foreign taxes  as well as state income taxes 
as a result of the net revenues and costs described above  we generated a net loss of million per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  net loss outlook we have had net losses in recent years and we expect to incur losses in future periods 
our net loss is highly dependent on the continued funding and success of our research and development programs with our existing collaborators 
our longstanding research collaborations with schering plough will reach maturity in august currently  we are planning for full time employee fte funding from the schering plough collaborations ceasing at that time 
the planned cessation of fte funding will have no impact on other areas of the collaborations  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in an inflammatory indication and multiple preclinical programs 
we will continue to be entitled to payments resulting from the successful achievement by schering plough  if any  of preclinical and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments from sales  if any  of products resulting from compounds already delivered by us and accepted by schering plough under the collaborations 
we are currently discussing potential partnerships with multiple companies to establish broad  multi year alliances that  consistent with our business strategy  have the potential to provide us with a larger share of product ownership than previous collaborations 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such alliances 
failure to replace the revenue from the schering plough collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
revenue recognition of funding from any new alliances may be different from revenue recognition of funding from the schering plough collaborations 
the principal agreement with organon  entered into in february  has a stated research term of five years 
failure to replace the revenue from the organon collaborations would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on a quarterly basis  our future operating results are likely to be highly volatile because they depend upon our receipt of milestone payments from our collaborators 
we may not receive milestone payments on a regular basis or at all 
our ability to achieve profitability will be significantly impacted by the increased level of investment we have determined to make in our internal proprietary programs in the future as well as the results of those programs 
the adoption of the financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment will have a significant impact on our results of operations  however  there will be no impact on the company s cash flows 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period after december  there is no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations  or that profitable operations  if achieved  could be sustained on a continuing basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and disclosures involve the use of judgments and estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies which we follow involve significant judgments and use estimates 
revenue recognition contract revenue is generally recognized either i on a proportional performance basis  for contracts specifying payment for services over a given period  or ii as services are performed under the agreement for contracts specifying payment on a full time employee basis 
revenue earned related to up front product and technology license fees is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin issued by the sec and eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables issued by the fasb 
accordingly  amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligation after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at a comparable level to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and acquired technology rights  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
this requires us to estimate future cash flows related to these assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which may affect the carrying amount of assets and the actual amortization expense 
as of december   we had long lived assets with a net book value of million 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision to sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after december  sfas r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas r is similar to sfas  with minor exceptions 
for information about what our reported results of operations and earnings per share would have been had we adopted sfas  please see the disclosure under the stock based compensation section of note of the notes to financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
based upon outstanding share based award grants through december   and future share based award grants remaining at levels consistent with recent history  we expect that the adoption under the modified prospective method will approximate the proforma expense previously disclosed under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our international sales generally are denominated in united states dollars  and are  therefore  not exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we regularly invest excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements that are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
our exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio since we have minimal debt 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not have materially affected the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
