for the third consecutive year  our net interest margin decreased  reflecting the industry wide trend that could effectively be offset only by growth and or new lines of business 
we continued to grow in  albeit at a diminished rate compared to prior years 
during we completed a branch transaction  which added three branches and approximately million in deposits 
late in we acquired an insurance agency 
see the more detailed discussion of these acquisitions on page of this report 
at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on shareholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  a decrease of  or  from year end our total shareholders equity at year end was below the year end level  despite million of net income for the year  due to i cash dividends million  ii repurchases of our own common stock million and accumulated other comprehensive losses million 
the primary component of other comprehensive losses in was net unrealized losses in our securities available for sale portfolio 
these unrealized losses were the result of the fact that as interest rates rose throughout  the value of our investments fell  as nearly all of the securities in our portfolio are at fixed interest rates 
as of the last trading day of  the average of our bid and asked stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to tangible book value 
the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend twice in  to

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
comparison of net interest income dollars in thousands tax equivalent basis years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount interest and dividend income interest expense net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in this compared to a thousand  or  increase between and factors contributing to the decrease in net interest income are discussed in the following portions of this section bi analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

from to  we experienced a small increase in net interest income of thousand  as the positive impact of an increase in average net earning assets was partially but not fully offset by the negative impact of a decrease in our net interest spread and net interest margin 
our net interest spread and margin decreased by and basis points  respectively  between and  compared to decreases of and basis points between and generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
key interest rate changes federal date funds rate prime rate january  december  november  september  august  june  may  march  rising rates february  december  november  september  august  june  june  november  december  november  october  september  august  june  falling rates may  april  march  january  january  may  our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
generally  there has been a negative correlation between changes in prevailing interest rates and our net interest margin in immediately ensuing periods 
when prevailing rates have declined  net interest margin generally has increased in immediately ensuing periods  and vice versa 
the following analysis of the relationship between prevailing rates and our net interest margin and net interest income covers the period from to the present 
since the fed began increasing rates in june  the yield curve has flattened  that is  as short term rates have risen  longer term rates have stayed unchanged over even lowered 
the flattening of the yield curve has been the most significant factor in reducing our net interest income from to from to  the federal reserve board decreased short term interest rates by an aggregate amount of basis points  or percent  in an irregular series of rate decreases calculated to spur consumer and business borrowing and economic activity 
the short term rate decreases triggered comparable long term rate decreases 
as a result of this multi year decrease in prevailing rates  we like other financial institutions  experienced a decrease in the cost of our deposit products in the periods 
we also experienced a decrease in the average yield in our loan portfolio during these years  although the decrease in our loan yield generally trailed  or lagged behind  our decreases in cost of deposits by three to six months resulting in higher margins and higher net interest income during the earlier portions of this declining rate period 
during and  the decrease in our deposit rates began to diminish  because rates on several of our deposit products  such as savings and now accounts  were already priced at such low levels that further significant decreases in the rates for such products was not practical or sustainable 
yields on our loan portfolio  however  continued to fall significantly in and  marking the beginning of a period of pressure on our net interest margin 
thus the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during and  which began to fade and then disappeared entirely in and the net interest margin for the full year was  a decrease of basis points  or  from the prior year 
during the yields on earning assets fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
as the above table indicates  the federal reserve reversed direction in and began to increase prevailing rates with five successive basis point increases in the federal funds rate in this change in direction did not immediately impact either our cost of paying liabilities or our yield on earning assets  both because of normal time lag in the responsiveness of our rates to federal reserve actions and because of ameliorative steps we took with our portfolios 
we changed the mix of our total deposits in the third quarter of  de emphasizing certain high cost municipal deposits  which had a positive impact on net interest margin for the quarter 
by the end of  however  the increases in the target federal funds rate started to have an impact on our cost of deposits which began to rise  although no immediate impact on our yields on assets  which as expected  remained nearly flat 
our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a decrease of basis points from the third quarter 
the net interest margin for the full year of was  a decrease of basis points  or  from the prior year 
during the yields on earning assets actually fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
throughout the federal reserve continued to make eight basis point increases to prevailing rates 
we expected and experienced a time lag in repricing our loans 
the yield on our loan portfolio continued to slide until mid year  when variable rate repricing and higher yields on new originations began to have a positive impact on increasing the yield of the whole portfolio 
however  the yield on earning assets for all of was the same as the yield in at 
meanwhile  the cost of our paying liabilities continued to increase ahead of the increase in our loan portfolio 
the cost of all paying liabilities for was  an increase of basis points  or  over the prior year 
consequently  net interest margin fell from in to for  a decrease of basis points  or 
in both rising and falling rate environments  we face significant competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace for our deposits and loans 
ultimately  we expect that both assets and liabilities will reprice proportionately in response to changes in market rates 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets vs 
in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income  assuming a positive spread between the cost paid on interest bearing liabilities and the yield earned on interest bearing assets 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income however this was offset by the million decrease due to changing rates discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  offset  in part  by an million decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold and virtually no change in the average balance of investment securities 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio increased by million  or 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom we acquire the dealer paper 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i commercial and commercial real estate loans million  or  ii residential real estate loans million  or and other consumer loans million  or 
the million increase in average paying liabilities resulted from an million increase in time deposits  offset  in part  by a million decrease in non maturity deposit balances 
the average balance of other borrowed funds was virtually unchanged 
the change in the mix of deposit categories from non maturity to time deposits is typical during a period of rising rates 
the million of deposits acquired in the april branch acquisition accounted for most of the increase in average deposit balances 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to an million  or  increase in the average balance on non interest bearing demand deposits 
vs 
in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income  assuming a positive spread between the cost paid on interest bearing liabilities and the yield earned on interest bearing assets 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income offset by the million decrease due to changing rates discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  and an increase in average investment securities of million  or 
within the loan portfolio  the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio actually decreased by million  or 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom we acquire the dealer paper 
this decrease was more than offset by increases in the average balances of commercial and commercial real estate loans million  or  residential real estate loans million  or and other consumer loans million  or 
the million increase in average paying liabilities included a increase in interest bearing nonmaturity deposits and an million increase in other borrowed funds  offset in part by a decrease of million in time deposits  which was the direct result of management s decision in mid to de emphasize certain high rate deposit products 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to the shift in the mix of deposit products from interest bearing to non interest bearing products 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
in addition to the following discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for a description of our policy with respect to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for the inherent risk of loss in the current portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
the determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods  recent changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of the portfolio 
vs 
at december   the quality of our loan portfolio remained strong and  to date  had not been negatively affected by loan growth experienced in recent periods 
at period end  our ratio of nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans was  virtually unchanged from the prior year end 
the september  ratio for our peer group was 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  which compared to net charge offs of thousand for  an increase of thousand  or 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a larger percentage during the year  our coverage ratio  allowance to period end loans was at year end  down from at year end net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  the same as for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for our peer group at september  was 
of average loans 
if the current economic conditions should worsen  we anticipate that net charge offs may exceed the levels experienced in recent years 
while we believe that the year end allowance of million was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  will not require increased provisions to the allowance or result in a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
vs 
at december  our ratio of nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans was  versus 
at year end at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from the provision was reduced  despite the growth in the loan portfolio  because asset quality indicators improved 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  virtually unchanged from the amount 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a similar percentage during the year  our coverage ratio  allowance to period end loans was the same at year end as at year end 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  down slightly from 
for vs 
at period end  the ratio of our nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans to total loans was 
the september  ratio for our peer group was 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from this reduction in the provision in a period of loan growth  like the subsequent reduction in  reflected general improvement in the portfolio quality indicators 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  virtually unchanged from the amount 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a similar percentage during the year  our coverage ratio was the same at year end as at year end 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  down slightly from 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for our peer group at september  was

other income the majority of our other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  computer processing fees and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gains on securities transactions insurance commissions other operating income total other income vs 
total other income increased million  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from most of the increase reflected increases in fee levels during  although some is attributable to an increase in assets under administration or management 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end the factors that led to a higher increase in income from fiduciary activities over the increase in the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management vs 
include i an increase in the fee structure  ii a decrease in assets under trust administration and investment management at the end of due to the transfer of one commercial account as a result of a business combination  and iii the loss of a large account at the end of from which we derived a relative ly small fee as a percentage of assets placed with us 
those assets were essentially replaced with others earning fees at our average rate 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in our proprietary north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the funds were introduced in march  and are advised by our subsidiary investment advisers  north country investment advisers  inc currently  the funds are owned almost entirely by qualified employee benefit plan accounts 
however  these funds are also offered on a retail basis through most of our bank branches 
included as an investor in the funds is our pension plan  which owned shares in the funds with a market value of approximately million at december  and million at fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from in  total other income included securities gains of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
the primary purpose of the sales was to capture gains in certain segments of the portfolio and to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives 
the following table presents sales and purchases within the available for sale portfolio during investment sales and purchases in thousands available for sale portfolio st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter sales collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total sales net gains purchases collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total purchases in november  we acquired a local insurance agency engaged in the sale of group health and life insurance 
see the more detailed discussion of the acquisition on page of this report 
therefore  the insurance commission income for  at million  represents the first full year of income from this business 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or  from  primarily because we sold fewer loans into the secondary market in during  we sold million of newly originated loans primarily residential real estate loans to the secondary market 
the net gains of thousand were primarily due to the fact that we were able to sell loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
by comparison  for  we sold only million of loans for net gains of thousand 
vs 
total other income increased thousand  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions  total other income increased by million  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end this increase reflected the general improvement in the equity markets  which began in late  and substantial new accounts attributable to business development efforts 
since the increase in assets under trust administration and investment management increased significantly at the end of  the percentage increase in income for over was greater than the percentage increase in assets under trust administration and investment management 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in our proprietary north country funds 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
fees for other services to customers amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to credit card and debit card merchant processing fees and deposit account service charges 
in  total other income included securities gains of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
the primary purpose of the sales was to capture gains in certain segments of the portfolio and to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives

for  other operating income decreased thousand  or  from  primarily because we sold fewer loans into the secondary market in during  we sold million of newly originated loans primarily residential real estate loans to the secondary market 
the net gains of thousand were primarily due to the fact that we were able to write loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
by comparison  in  we sold million of loans for net gains of thousand 
iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense other operating expense total other expense vs 
other expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from one comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are intangible asset amortization and any net securities gains or losses 
for  the efficiency ratio for arrow was  an increase from the ratio of 
our ratio  however  still compared favorably to the year to date ratio for our peer group of as of september  for information on the calculation of our efficiency ratios on a quarterly and annual basis  see pages and of this report 
also see the discussion on page regarding use of non gaap financial meas ures 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over  due primarily to staff increases as result of the acquisition of new branches in april  and acquisition of the insurance agency in late  as well as to normal merit increases 
employee benefits actually decreased from to this was primarily attributable to decreases in incentive compensation costs 
on an annualized basis  the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the ratio for our peer group of at september  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of building maintenance 
furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to both occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense increased as a result of the branch and insurance agency acquisitions referred to in the preceding paragraph 
other operating expense increased from to  by thousand  or 
intangible asset amortization increased thousand as a result of the branch and insurance agency acquisitions 
although all other categories of other operating expense experienced some increases from the acquisitions  the areas with the largest increases were legal  postage and supplies 
vs 
other expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over  due primarily to merit increases 
the increase in employee benefits from to was  and was primarily attributable to increases in nonpension postretirement benefit costs  as well as increases in health insurance benefit costs 
occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of lease expense  depreciation and real estate taxes 
furniture and equipment expense actually decreased by thousand  or  from to the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in equipment maintenance costs 
other operating expense also decreased from to by thousand  or 
the net decrease was distributed among a variety of categories of other operating expense

financial condition i 
investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired and are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the reporting company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
at december   we held no trading securities 
set fo rth below is certain information about our securities available for sale portfolio and securities held to maturity portofolio 
securities available for sale the following table sets forth the carrying value of our securities available for sale portfolio at year end  and securities available for sale in thousands december  us treasury and agency obligations state and municipal obligations collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities corporate and other debt securities mutual funds and equity securities total in all periods  other mortgage backed securities principally consisted of agency mortgage pass through securities 
pass through securities provide to the investor monthly portions of principal and interest pursuant to the contractual obligations of the underlying mortgages 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmos separate the repayments into two or more components tranches  where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield 
our practice has been to purchase pass through securities and cmos guaranteed by federal agencies and tranches of cmos with shorter maturities 
included in corporate and other debt securities are highly rated corporate bonds and commercial paper 
at year end  approximately million  or  of the listed amount of mutual funds and equity securities consisted of required holdings of stock of the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york 
the following table sets forth the maturities of our securities available for sale portfolio as of december  cmos and other mortgage backed securities are included in the table based on their expected average lives 
mutual funds and equity securities  which have no stated maturity  are included in the after year category 
maturities of securities available for sale in thousands within one year after but within years after but within years after years total us treasury and agency obligations state and municipal obligations collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities corporate and other debt securities mutual funds and equity securities total the following table sets forth the tax equivalent yields of our securities available for sale portfolio at december  yields on securities available for sale fully tax equivalent basis within one year after but within years after but within years after years total us treasury and agency obligations state and municipal obligations collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities corporate and other debt securities mutual funds and equity securities total the yields on debt securities shown in the table above are calculated by dividing annual interest  including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  by the amortized cost of the securities at december  yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were computed on a fully tax equivalent basis using a marginal tax rate of 
dividend earnings derived from equity securities were adjusted to reflect applicable federal income tax exclusions 
at december  and  the weighted average maturity was and years  respectively  for debt securities in the available for sale portfolio 
at december   the net unrealized losses on securities available for sale amounted to million 
the net unrealized gain or loss on such securities  net of tax  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net unrealized loss at december  represents a million decrease from the net unrealized gain total of million at december   and is primarily attributable to the decreased fair value of the debt securities primarily fixed rate portfolios resulting from an increase in prevailing interest rates  chiefly short term rates  throughout for further information regarding our portfolio of securities available for sale  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
distribution of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect loans other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net residential real estate loans from to  residential real estate loans represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
at december   such loans constituted of total loans 
this segment of our portfolio increased by million  or  from year end to during we originated approximately million of residential real estate loans and of those  sold million with servicing retained of fixed low rate mortgages 
residential mortgage demand was moderate during and except for the first quarter throughout we expect that  if we continue to retain all or most originations  we will be able to maintain the level of residential real estate loans and may experience some continued growth 
however  if the demand for residential real estate loan decreases  our portfolio also may decrease  which may be expected to negatively impact our financial performance 
indirect loans for several years prior to  indirect consumer loans consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper was the largest segment of loans in the portfolio 
for several years preceding the third quarter of  the indirect consumer loan portfolio was the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
over the subsequent quarters  this segment of the portfolio ceased to grow in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this flattening of indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing by auto manufacturers  commencing in the fall of during the fourth quarter of and for the first two quarters of  the indirect portfolio experienced a small amount of gro wth as we became more rate competitive  but the level of indirect loans was flat for the third quarter of and decreased by million during the fourth quarter of during the first half of indirect loan balances continued to decline  and then rose slightly during the second half of the year 
at the end of the first quarter of  we experienced an increase in indirect loans  which did not have a large impact on the average balance for the quarter an thousand increase from the prior quarter  but did cause the balance at period end to rise sharply to million 
we continued to experience strong demand for indirect loans throughout the second and third quarters of  for a variety of factors  including modifications by the automobile manufacturers of their subsidized financing programs 
the average balances increased by million  or  from the first quarter to the second quarter and by another million  or  in the third quarter 
by the end of the fourth quarter of  however  indirect loan balances had declined million  or  from the balance at the end of the third quarter of although the average balance for the fourth quarter was slightly higher than the average balance for the third quarter 
indirect loans still represent the second largest category of loans in our portfolio  and any developments threatening our indirect loan business generally may be expected to have a negative impact on our financial performance 
if auto manufacturers resume their heavily subsidized financing programs  our indirect loan portfolio is likely to continue to experience rate pressure and limited  if any  overall growth 
commercial and commercial real estate loans we continued to experience strong to moderate demand for commercial loans in  a continuing trend that has persisted for several years  as commercial and commercial real estate loans have grown each year for the past five years  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
during commercial and commercial real estate loan balances increased million  or  from year end the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters

however  these same loan balances are reported as real estate residential in the table of period end balances on the previous page  captioned distribution of loans 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets has been impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed on page under the heading key interest rate changes we expect that such will continue to be the case  that is  that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will continue to be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the makeup of the loan portfolio  consumer expectations and preferences  the rate at which the portfolio expands  and the shape of the yield curve 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlb or us treasury indices 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during the recently concluded long period of declining rates from mid to the end of june  we experienced a time lag between the impact of declining rates on the deposit portfolio which was felt relatively quickly and the impact on the loan portfolio which occurred more slowly 
the consequence of this particular time lag was a positive impact on the net interest margin during the beginning of the rate decline period  followed by a negative impact on the margin in more recent periods as the rate decline ended 
the net interest margin expanded during and into the first quarter of as deposit rates decreased rapidly 
our deposit rates began to flatten out in mid  while loan yields continued to decline 
as a result  the net interest margin began to contract in the second quarter of generally  this pattern persisted through the remainder of  all of and the first two quarters of  with the cost of deposits decreasing only slightly  if at all  and loan yields decreasing somewhat faster 
thus the yield on our loan portfolio decreased by basis points in the second quarter of  while the cost of our interest bearing deposits only decreased by basis points for the same period 
on june   the federal reserve board ended an uninterrupted four year period of falling rates with a basis point increase in prevailing rates  followed by additional basis point increases in each fomc meeting through the end of january  for a total of consecutive basis point increases 
due to the expected time lag between rising short term rates and the repricing of loan balances  the yield on our loan portfolio not only failed to rise  but continued to fall from the second quarter of into the third quarter of however  the decrease in the portfolio yield came to a halt in the first half of and then yields began to slowly increase during the last two quarters of during this current period of rising rates and due to the time lag in loan repricing perhaps even for a while after fed stops increasing rates  we expect that the yield on our loan portfolio will slowly reprice upward  although possibly more slowly than the deposit portfolio  resulting in continued pressure on our net interest income and net interest margin 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
all of the real estate construction loans are for single family houses where we have also made a commitment for permanent financing 
maturity and repricing of commercial loans in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not then funded 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
b 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy  established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the table presented on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses  are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
nbs p  we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
during  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
at year end  the balance of the loan was thousand and had a related reserve of thousand 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented

income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans  if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
during  two commercial loans were considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
by year end  one of these loans was fully paid off with no portion of the loan charged off leaving  at year end  one impaired loan with a balance of thousand and a related reserve of thousand

during  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
the loan was returned to accrual status before year end there were no impaired loans at december  at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from

income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans  if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of this approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  we normally do not identify any significant number of potential problem loans in our portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above eg nonaccrual  days past due and still accruing interest or troubled debt restructurings 
at year end and  we had no such additional potential problem loans 
the balance of other non current loans to which interest income was being accrued ie loans days past due as defined in bank regulatory agency guidance totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  million of residential real estate loans and thousand of commercial loans 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in our geographic market area was relatively strong in the period 
although the us experienced a mild recession in  which continued throughout and into  the economic downturn during this period was not as severe in northeastern new york state 
during and the unemployment rate remained below the national average in the capital district in and around albany and in the area north of the capital district  which are our principal service areas

summary of loan loss experience we monitor credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate loans are reviewed at least annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of our loan portfolio and report on these examinations to management 
the boards of directors of our banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for probable loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook and financial condition and prospects 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the total size of the loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses  presents a summary of the activity in our allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since we regard the allowance as a general balance and have assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure requirements  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
on a quarterly basis  we risk classify delinquent or problem loans in the commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated

deposits the following table sets forth the average balances of and average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated 
average deposit balances years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance rate average balance rate average balance rate demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for early in april we acquired approximately million of deposit balances in the branch purchase transaction 
this would account for approximately million of the increase in average balances over the full year 
the remaining increase was generated from our pre existing branch network 
during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  from although we opened a branch in queensbury  ny in june  nearly all of the increase in deposit balances during was generated from our pre existing branch network 
no branches were purchased in during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  from the increase in deposit balances during was largely generated from our pre existing branch network  although we did open one branch 
no branches were acquired in the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type and the percentage of total deposits represented by each deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits for a variety of reasons  including the seasonality of municipal deposits  we typically experience little net deposit growth in the first quarter of the year  but more significant growth in the second quarter 
average deposit balances followed this pattern for the first two quarters of the average balance of deposits actually decreased from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of excluding the impact of our acquisition of three branches in april  all categories of deposits except regular and money market savings experienced growth in the second quarter of above first quarter balances 
although average deposit balances for the third quarter of when municipal deposits are at a seasonal low were down slightly from the second quarter average balances  we did experience increases in consumer and business account balances 
the increase in average balances from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of was attributable to a seasonal inflow of municipal deposits  which are primarily held in either now or short term time deposits 
the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is shorter than the lag between federal reserve actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the federal reserve rate decreases in the through mid period  we experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits throughout the period 
the cost of deposits during the second quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
after the federal reserve board began its recent series of rate increases in june  cited earlier  our cost of deposits continued to fall in the third quarter of as maturing time deposits were still repricing at lower rates 
by the fourth quarter of and throughout  however  our average cost of deposits increased each quarter 
we expect that this trend will continue until the federal reserve board discontinues its current series of interest rate increases  and may continue slightly beyond that point due to the time lag between federal reserve rate changes and our repricing of time deposits

liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of our balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  we have supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million 
the average balance throughout was million and there was no period end balance 
we have established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb  each of these lines provided for a maximum borrowing line of million at december  we borrowed only on the overnight line of credit with the fhlb during the average balance throughout was million and the period end balance was million 
if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  we have in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also have identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding accessible in relatively short time periods 
also  glens falls national has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed securities  and from maturing loans in our portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   a decrease of thousand  or  from the prior year end 
despite net income of million  shareholders equity decreased in due primarily to i cash dividends million  ii repurchases of our own common stock million and  iii other comprehensive losses million 
the primary component of other comprehensive losses in was net unrealized losses in our securities available for sale portfolio 
these unrealized losses were the result of the fact that as interest rates rose throughout  the value of our portfolio fell  as nearly all of the securities were at fixed interest rates 
in each of and  we privately placed million of capital securities issued by a subsidiary delaware business trust specifically formed for such purpose 
these trust preferred securities were reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
under final rules issued by the federal reserve on february   trust preferred securities may qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues qualify as regulatory capital under capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item for a further description of our trust preferred securities 
at de cember   we redeemed a million issue of trust preferred securities originally issued and sold by us in the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to our holding company and subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions

the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management proces s 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions from june through january that resulted in fourteen basis point increases in prevailing rates 
we believe that continued increases in prevailing interest rates will have a continuing short to medium term negative impact on our net interest margin and net interest income as well 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
