item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview general our products are used primarily in new home construction  repair and remodeling  and manufactured housing 
we also market and sell our products in light industrial and commercial construction and have a modest export business for some of our specialty building products 
our manufacturing facilities are primarily located in the us and canada  but we also operate a facility in chile 
to serve these markets  we operate in three segments oriented strand board osb  siding  and engineered wood products ewp 
osb is the most significant segment  accounting for of continuing sales in  in and in over the last several years  we adopted and implemented plans to sell selected businesses and assets in order to improve our operating results  reduce our debt and increase our financial flexibility 
the plans involved divesting lp s plywood  industrial panel  vinyl siding and lumber businesses  fee timber and timberlands  a wholesale operation and our distribution business 
we believe that these divestitures  which had been substantially completed at december   enable us to focus our attention exclusively on our retained businesses  and to develop strategies to make them stronger through cost reductions  increased efficiencies and appropriate capacity expansions 
our retained businesses have several common characteristics that include significant scale in the categories in which they compete  strong growth potential in the future and competitive cost structures 
our most significant product  osb  is sold as a commodity for which sales prices fluctuate daily based on market factors over which we have little or no control 
we cannot predict whether the prices of our products will remain at current levels  increase or decrease in the future 
during  commodity osb prices moderated compared to but nonetheless remained at relatively high cyclical levels 
we saw significant increases in the cost of petroleum based raw materials  energy and wood including log delivery costs throughout our businesses 
in our non commodity based businesses  we were able to implement price increases to partially mitigate these cost increases 
we expect the costs of these inputs to remain at relatively high levels  and possibly to increase further  in the foreseeable future 
factors affecting our results revenues and operating costs 
we derive our revenues from sales of our products 
the unit volumes of products sold and the prices at which sales are made determine the amount of our revenues 
these volumes and prices are affected by the overall level of demand for  and supply of  products of the type we sell and comparable or substitute products  and by competitive conditions in our industry 
our operating results reflect the relationship between the amount of our revenues and our costs of production and other operating costs and expenses 
our costs of production are affected by  among other factors  costs of raw materials primarily wood fiber and various petroleum based resins and energy costs  which in turn are affected by the overall market supply of and demand for these manufacturing inputs 
the canadian dollar strengthened significantly against the us dollar in  causing our costs  as reported in us dollars  to rise 
demand for building products 
demand for our products correlates to a significant degree to the level of residential construction activity in north america  which historically has been characterized by significant cyclicality 
this activity can be further delineated into three areas new home construction  repair and remodeling  and manufactured housing 
new home construction 
during the last three years  there has been increased housing activity driven by a combination of higher demand due to the demographics of the us population and a low interest rate environment 
the chart below provides a graphical summary of new housing starts in the us since the level of volatility in housing starts has moderated in recent years 
we believe that this is largely due to the continued consolidation among the big homebuilders  shortage of construction laborers and lengthier processes to obtain appropriate zoning 
the chart below depicts actual  rolling five and ten year average housing starts 
graphic source resource international systems  inc risi repair and remodeling 
demand for building materials to support home improvement projects is largely tied to the size and age of the existing housing stock in north america 
as can be seen from the chart above  the s and s had some of the highest levels of building activity 
this puts these homes at an age of years  which has been shown to be consistent with the highest per home expenditure rate on repair and remodeling 
with the rise in the number and scale of home improvement stores in north america  individuals now have ready and convenient access to obtain the building materials needed for repair and remodeling  as well as increased access to installation services 
we believe that the growth rate over the last three years has been in the range  and has been driven by increased store to store sales and the addition of new stores 
manufactured housing 
while new home construction activity has been robust in the last three years  manufactured housing has suffered 
there are several factors that have led to the decline in the number of manufactured housing units produced  including a lack of available financing  increased ability of potential customers to purchase site built starter homes and financial difficulties at some of the larger manufactured housing producers 
supply of building products 
osb is a commodity product  and all of our products are subject to competition from manufacturers worldwide 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
according to resource international systems inc risi  an economic consulting firm  total north american osb annual production is projected to increase by approximately billion square feet in the period from to while plywood production is projected to decline by billion square feet for the same period 
the chart below depicts the north america structural wood market in billions of square feet 
graphic product pricing 
historical prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the building products industry  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
according to random lengths  an industry publication  the average north central wholesale price for osb per thousand square feet basis from through is presented below 
additionally  according to risi as of december  the forecast for average north central wholesale price for osb per thousand square feet basis through is also included 
graphic critical accounting policies presented in note of the notes to the financial statements in item of this report is a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the discussion of each of the policies outlines the specific accounting treatment related to each of these accounting areas 
while all of these are important to understand when reading our financial statements  there are several policies that we have adopted and implemented from among acceptable alternatives that could lead to different financial results had another policy been chosen inventory valuation 
we use the lifo last in  first out method for some of our log inventories with the remaining inventories valued at fifo first in  first out or average cost 
our inventories would have been approximately million higher if the lifo inventories were valued at average cost as of december  property  plant and equipment 
we principally use the units of production method of depreciation for machinery and equipment 
this method amortizes the cost of machinery and equipment over the estimated units that will be produced during its estimated useful life 
stock options 
we have chosen to report our stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees under which no compensation cost for stock options is recognized for stock options granted at or above fair market value 
as permitted through  we have applied only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which established a fair value approach to measuring compensation expense related to employee stock compensation plans 
had compensation expense for our stock based compensation plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant dates under those plans consistent with sfas no 
 our net income would have been lower 
for  had we recorded this compensation expense  our net income would have been lower by million 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which will require us to use the fair value method beginning in the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r is discussed further in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
significant accounting estimates and judgments throughout the preparation of the financial statements  we employ significant judgments in the application of accounting principles and methods 
these judgments are primarily related to the assumptions used to arrive at various estimates 
for  these significant accounting estimates and judgments include legal contingencies 
our estimates of loss contingencies for legal proceedings are based on various judgments and assumptions regarding the potential resolution or disposition of the underlying claims and associated costs 
in making judgments and assumptions regarding legal contingencies for ongoing class action settlements  we consider  among other things  discernible trends in the rate of claims asserted and related damage estimates and information obtained through consultation with statisticians and economists  including statistical analyses of potential outcomes based on experience to date and the experience of third parties who have been subject to product related claims judged to be comparable 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
workers compensation self insurance liabilities 
we are self insured for workers compensation in most us states 
the liability recorded in our financial statements for self insured workers compensation claims is based on the estimates of a third party administrator of the future liability based on the specific facts and circumstances of each specific claim at any point in time 
we do not use actuarial data from our past workers compensation claims history or general industry experience to project the growth of workers compensation claims over time 
had we done so  our workers compensation liabilities might have been higher than the amount we currently have recorded  although we cannot presently estimate by how much 
environmental contingencies 
our estimates of loss contingencies for environmental matters are based on various judgments and assumptions 
these estimates typically reflect judgments and assumptions relating to the probable nature  magnitude and timing of required investigation  remediation and or monitoring activities and the probable cost of these activities  and in some cases reflect judgments and assumptions relating to the obligation or willingness and ability of third parties to bear a proportionate or allocated share of the cost of these activities  including third parties who purchased assets from us subject to environmental liabilities 
we consider the ability of third parties to pay their apportioned cost when developing our estimates 
in making these judgments and assumptions related to the development of our loss contingencies  we consider  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites  information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors and our historical experience at other sites that are judged to be comparable 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  and the effects of changes in governmental regulation and environmental technologies  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to environmental loss contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
at december   we excluded from our estimates approximately million of potential environmental liabilities that we estimate will be allocated to third parties pursuant to existing and anticipated future cost sharing arrangements 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the long lived assets held and used by us primarily property  plant and equipment and timber and timberlands for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
identifying these events and changes in circumstances  and assessing their impact on the appropriate valuation of the affected assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates 
in general  on assets held and used  impairments are recognized when the book values exceed our estimate of the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with the affected assets 
the key assumptions in estimating these cash flows include future production volumes and pricing of commodity or specialty products and future estimates of expenses to be incurred 
our assumptions regarding pricing are based upon the average pricing over the commodity cycle generally five years due to the inherent volatility of commodity product pricing 
these prices are estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts and other published forecasts 
our estimates of expenses are based upon our long range internal planning models and our expectation that we will continue to reduce product costs that will offset inflationary impacts 
when impairment is indicated  the book values of the assets to be held and used are written down to their estimated fair value that is generally based upon discounted future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are written down to their estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs 
consequently  a determination to dispose of particular assets can require us to estimate the net sales proceeds expected to be realized upon such disposition  which may be less than the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows associated with such assets prior to such determination  and thus require an impairment charge 
in situations where we have experience in selling assets of a similar nature  we may estimate net sales proceeds on the basis of that experience 
in other situations  we hire independent appraisers to estimate net sales proceeds 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of assets in these circumstances  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related impairment charges are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
income taxes 
the determination of the provision for income taxes  and the resulting current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  involves significant management judgment  and is based upon information and estimates available to management at the time of such determination 
the final income tax liability to any taxing jurisdiction with respect to any calendar year will ultimately be determined long after our financial statements have been published for that year 
we maintain reserves for known estimated tax exposures in federal  state and international jurisdictions  however  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when we consider it to be more likely than not that all or some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax asset that is estimated not to be realizable 
as of december   we had established valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets  primarily related to foreign tax credit carryovers  state net operating loss and credit carryovers and foreign capital loss carryovers 
we have not established valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets based upon expected future taxable income and or tax strategies planned to mitigate the risk of impairment of these assets 
accordingly  changes in facts or circumstances affecting the likelihood of realizing a deferred tax asset could result in the need to record additional valuation allowances 
during  we reflected the estimated impacts of two provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca in the determination of our tax liabilities and expense 
the first provision  a deduction relating to income attributable to united states production activities  became effective january  the complexity of the law and lack of clear and concise guidance regarding the application of the provision to our facts required the use of significant judgments and estimates 
a second provision of the ajca allowed us to repatriate accumulated earnings from our canadian subsidiaries at a reduced effective federal tax rate 
we applied our judgment and estimates in the determination of amounts of earnings and profits that qualified under the repatriation provision  the amount of tax that would be applicable in the us and canada to the amounts distributed and our ability to meet the reinvestment requirements pursuant to our executed domestic reinvestment plan as required under the ajca 
we believe we have applied the provisions of the ajca appropriately and recorded the related impacts in our financial statements  but as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change significantly 
goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are no longer amortized 
however  these indefinite life assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis  and otherwise when indicators of impairment are determined to exist  by applying a fair value based test 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgments at many points during the analysis 
in testing for potential impairment  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined based upon cash flow forecasts  is compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
the key assumptions in estimating these cash flows include future production volumes and pricing of commodity products and future estimates of expenses to be incurred 
our assumptions regarding pricing are based upon the average pricing over the commodity cycle generally five years due to the inherent volatility of commodity product pricing 
these prices are estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts and other published forecasts 
our estimates of expenses are based upon our long range internal planning models and our expectation that we will reduce product costs that will offset inflationary impacts 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of assets in these circumstances  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related impairment charges  if any  are subject to substantial uncertainties 
consequently  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
pension plans 
most of our us employees and many of our canadian employees participate in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by lp 
we account for the consequences of our sponsorship of these plans in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make actuarial assumptions that are used to calculate the related assets  liabilities and expenses recorded in our financial statements 
while we believe we have a reasonable basis for these assumptions  which include assumptions regarding long term rates of return on plan assets  life expectancies  rates of increase in salary levels  rates at which future values should be discounted to determine present values and other matters  the amounts of our pension related assets  liabilities and expenses recorded in our financial statements would differ if we used other assumptions 
see further discussion related to pension plans below under the heading defined benefit pension plans and in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
results of operations we earned net income of million per diluted share in  which was comprised of income from continuing operations of million per diluted share  a loss from discontinued operations of million per diluted share and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million per diluted share 
this compares to a net income of million per diluted share in  which was comprised of income from continuing operations of million per diluted share and income from discontinued operations of million 
we earned million per diluted share in that was comprised of income from continuing operations of million per diluted share  a loss from discontinued operations of million per diluted share and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
sales in were billion  a decrease of from sales of billion 
sales in as compared to were higher by 
the decrease in and the increase in were both largely attributable to changes in osb pricing  which is discussed further below 
our results of operations for each of our segments are discussed below  as are results of operations for the other category which comprises other products that are not individually significant 
see note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report for further information regarding our segments 
osb our osb segment manufactures and distributes osb structural panels 
our osb segment also sells of the volume sold in north america that is manufactured at a canadian osb plant owned by our joint venture with canfor 
this plant began production in november of our strategy to continue to enhance our industry leading position in the osb business involves increasing investment in our existing facilities in order to reduce costs and improve throughput and recovery by continuing to focus on efficiency  improving net realizations relative to weighted average osb regional pricing  leveraging our expertise in osb to capitalize on new opportunities for revenue growth through new product lines  and expanding capacity to meet growing osb demand  but doing so through internal growth at existing facilities  selected acquisitions that meet specific criteria and by building new  low cost manufacturing facilities to serve particular markets 
osb is manufactured through the use of wood strands arranged in layers and bonded with resins and wax 
significant cost inputs to produce osb and approximate breakdown percentages as of the year ended december  include wood  resin and wax  labor and burden  utilities and manufacturing and other 
segment profits and related depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested for this segment are as follows increase decrease year ended december  in millions sales operating profits depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested percent changes in average sales prices and unit shipments for the year ended compared to and compared to are as follows versus versus average net selling price unit shipments average net selling price unit shipments osb compared to osb prices declined during compared to due in large part to increased industry capacity which softened prices from the prior year 
lower average selling prices accounted for reduced net sales and operating profits of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to compared to the prior year  the primary factor for decreased operating profits was the lower average selling prices discussed above 
additionally  we experienced a significant increase in the cost of petroleum based raw materials principally resins  delivered log costs and energy costs 
compared to  resin costs per unit increased over and delivered log cost per unit increased about for the same period 
additionally  a significant portion of our osb costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
the canadian dollar has strengthened significantly since which causes our costs stated in us dollars to increase 
additionally  lp recorded losses related to the canfor joint venture in  because the facility did not begin production until november and was incurring administrative costs throughout compared to osb prices increased during compared to due to strong market demand 
higher average selling prices accounted for substantial increases in net sales and operating profits of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to increased demand coupled with limited additional industry capacity that had been put into service during were largely responsible for this price increase 
compared to  the primary factor for increased operating profits in was the higher average selling prices and slightly higher volumes  which were partially offset by an increase in operating costs for the year 
the increase in operating costs at the mills was primarily due to higher wood  resin and energy costs 
additionally  because of the strengthening canadian dollar  operating costs at our canadian osb mills were negatively affected when canadian dollar denominated costs were translated into us dollars 
siding our siding segment produces and markets composite wood siding and related accessories  interior hardboard products and specialty osb products 
we believe that we are the leading wood composite exterior cladding producer in north america 
we manufacture exterior siding and other cladding products for the residential and commercial building markets 
additionally  we are seeking to optimize our current capacity by extending the hardboard lifecycle through innovative new products and features 
our strategy is to drive product innovation by utilizing our technological expertise in wood and wood composites to better address the needs of our customers 
we intend to increase our product offerings and production capacity of higher margin  value added products through the addition of lower cost plants or the conversion of osb plants from commodity structural panel production to osb based exterior siding products 
segment profits and related depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested for this segment are as follows increase decrease year ended december  in millions sales operating profits depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested sales in this segment are broken down as follows year ended december  in millions osb based exterior products includes commodity osb hardboard siding total percent changes in average sales prices and unit shipments for the year ended compared to and compared to are as follows versus versus average net selling price unit shipments average net selling price unit shipments osb based exterior products commodity osb hardboard siding compared to sales volumes in decreased slightly for osb based exterior products while sales prices were higher due to a price increase that took effect on january  to offset increases in raw material costs 
in our hardboard product line  sales volume declined and sales prices increased due to a change in product mix as we shifted production capacity to higher margin siding products and away from interior hardboard products 
during the three year period ended december   one of our smartside siding facilities silsbee  texas also produced commodity osb 
the commodity osb volume increased significantly in due to market demands in the southern us for osb especially in the latter portion of due to the fall hurricanes 
see the discussion in our osb segment above for a discussion of changes in commodity osb pricing 
additionally  due to persistent operational problems at this mill  we sold large quantities of off grade siding material which sells at a substantially lower margin 
in the fall of  we decided to cease siding production at silsbee beginning in and to use this facility solely to produce commodity osb 
instead  one of two lines at our hayward  wisconsin osb facility will begin to manufacture siding in overall  the decline in operating results for our siding segment compared to was primarily due to the poor operating performance at our silsbee  texas mill mentioned above and increased costs for delivered logs  energy and resin 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales prices 
compared to sales volume increased in over the prior year in our osb based exterior products due to continued market penetration and brand awareness 
volumes also increased in our hardboard siding and doorskin business due to the addition of several new customers as one of our competitors exited the business 
sales prices in the osb based exterior products and hardboard businesses showed increases in price due to both changes in product mix as well as general price increases implemented to help offset higher raw material costs in all of these lines of business 
during the three year period ended december   one of our specialty osb facilities silsbee  texas also produced commodity osb 
the commodity osb volume declined significantly in as market demand for osb based exterior products increased 
during as compared to  sales and production volumes of commodity osb decreased 
see the discussion of our osb segment above for a discussion of changes in commodity osb pricing 
overall  the decline in operating results for our siding segment compared to was primarily due to the reduction in commodity osb sales and profits  which were sold at a higher margin than our osb based exterior products during this period and increases in operating costs including higher wood fiber  resin and energy costs not offset by price increases 
engineered wood products our engineered wood products ewp segment manufactures and distributes laminated veneer lumber lvl  i joists and other related products 
this segment also sells of the i joist production of two facilities owned in our joint venture with abitibi consolidated 
our strategy is to strengthen our brand name recognition in the ewp industry by enhancing our product mix and quality  providing superior technical support for our customers and leveraging our sales and marketing relationships to cross sell our ewp products 
additionally  we are seeking to drive costs down by rationalizing production capacity across geographic areas and improving operating efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities 
segment profits losses and related depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested for this segment are as follows increase decrease year ended december  in millions sales operating profits losses depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested sales in this segment are broken down as follows year ended december  in millions lvl i joist plywood related products total percent changes in average sales prices and unit shipments for the year ended compared to and compared to are as follows versus versus average net selling price unit shipments average net selling price unit shipments lvl i joist compared to during  we experienced slowing sales volumes in lvl and a slight increase in i joist sales volumes 
this comes after two years of double digit growth per year in both product lines 
sales prices increased due to several significant price increases both at the end of and early in to offset the higher raw material costs 
our focus continues to be on reductions in conversion costs  better geographic manufacturing and distribution  and maintaining key customer relationships 
included in this segment is a plywood mill  which primarily produces plywood as a by product from the lvl production process 
the results of operations of our ewp segment improved significantly primarily due to significant price increases which more than offset increases in raw material costs primarily veneer  osb and lumber over the prior year 
compared to during  we continued to grow our engineered wood products segment 
we saw significant growth in both lvl and i joist with the addition of several new distributors and expanded our presence with large production builders 
during the latter half of  we implemented price increases to offset higher raw material costs 
included in this segment is a plywood mill  which primarily produces plywood as a by product from the lvl production process 
given the general price increase in plywood which typically follows osb we operated this facility at higher levels during the results of operations of our ewp segment improved primarily due to price increases  which were necessary to mitigate increases in raw material costs primarily veneer  osb and lumber 
about one third of the operating profit in this segment in was attributable to our i joist joint venture with abitibi 
other products our other products category includes our moulding  composite decking business  chilean operations and our joint venture to produce cellouse insulation 
additionally  this category includes our remaining timber and timberlands and other minor products  services and operations closed prior to january  profits for this category and related depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested for this category are as follows increase decrease year ended december  in millions sales operating profits depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested sales in this category are broken down as follows year ended december  in millions mouldings chilean operation decking other total for decking and moulding  percent changes in average sales prices and unit shipments for the year ended compared to and compared to are as follows versus versus average net selling price unit shipments average net selling price unit shipments moulding decking compared to during  we continued to see strength in sales in our decking and chilean businesses 
our moulding sales were flat while our other businesses in this category all showed declining sales 
in our mouldings product line  we saw relatively flat sales volumes with slightly higher sales prices 
during the year  we were notified of a loss of a key customer  although that customer continued to purchase product from us throughout we expect to lose these sales in  but have added a new key customer that will partially offset the lost volume 
in our composite decking business  we saw a slight decrease in volumes as we terminated some of our distributors and replaced them with the bluelinx distribution network 
while we believe that this replacement will lead to increases in sales in  it caused a disruption in our sales volumes during the later portion of as current distributors worked through existing inventory 
for both our moulding and decking operations  we saw significant increases in the price of petroleum based raw materials which negatively impacted margins 
in our chilean operation  we continued to see increased sales due to both higher commodity osb pricing and increased volumes through better acceptance of osb in the local markets and increased export volumes to asia 
additionally  sales of logs to third parties from our timber contracts declined as we worked through the remaining contracts associated with previously sold facilities 
our joint venture to produce cellouse insulation improved significantly in and due to lower raw material costs and increased market penetration 
overall  operating profits in this category declined slightly due to increased raw materials costs which were partially offset by our share of increased profits at our insulation joint venture 
compared to during  we grew our moulding  decking and chilean businesses while our other businesses in this category all showed a decline 
in our mouldings product line  we continued to see increases in both unit shipments and sales prices due to continued strength in retail activity in home centers 
in our composite decking business  we saw increased volumes as a result of continued marketing efforts to gain new customers as well as increased production due to capital expansion at one of our facilities 
in our chilean operation  we had increased sales due to increases in commodity osb pricing and volumes through further acceptance of osb in local markets 
the declines in our other businesses are primarily due to the reduction in sales primarily attributable to the divesture of most of our lumber facilities thus reducing the sales through vmi and reload locations 
additionally  sales of logs to third parties from our timberlands or related timber contracts declined with the sale of our remaining fee timberlands in october of overall  the results of this category improved due to the improved profitability of our moulding and decking businesses 
general corporate and other expense  net net general corporate expense was million in as compared to million in and million in general corporate and other expenses primarily consist of corporate overhead such as wages and benefits for corporate personnel  professional fees  insurance  travel costs  non product specific marketing and other expenses 
the decrease in as compared to primarily resulted from several one time charges recorded in related to stock compensation accruals million that were not required in and several non recurring credits recorded in including a settlement of million 
the increase in as compared to was primary related to higher stock compensation expenses due to meeting vesting acceleration targets for some awards  higher management bonuses due to improved operating results  and costs associated with compliance  notably sarbanes oxley implementation 
other operating credits and charges  net for a discussion of other operating credits and charges  net  refer to notes and of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
gain loss on sales of and impairments of long lived assets for a discussion of gain loss on sales of and impairments of long lived assets  refer to notes and of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
investment income  net of interest expense in  net investment income was million compared to net interest expense in and of million and million 
we earned net investment income in compared to incurring net interest expense in because we repaid our highest rate debt in late and in we also maintained higher average cash and investment balances in compared to the decrease in net interest expense in compared to was due to significantly higher cash and investment balances as well as lower outstanding debt 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates over the last several years  we have entered into several joint venture arrangements 
these include a joint venture with casella waste management systems  inc to produce cellulose insulation  a joint venture with canfor corporation to construct and operate an osb mill in british columbia  and a joint venture with abitibi consolidated to construct and operate two i joist facilities in quebec 
in august  together with casella waste management systems  inc  we each contributed most of the assets of our respective cellulose insulation operations to a joint venture  us greenfiber  llc greenfiber 
pursuant to the limited liability company agreement  each company owns of greenfiber 
greenfiber elected to be treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and therefore the entity is not taxed directly 
greenfiber s operations improved significantly in and due to higher sales prices and increased market penetration 
the results of this operation are included within other products 
in  together with canfor corporation  we entered into an agreement to jointly construct an million square foot osb facility in british columbia  canada 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  each company owns of the venture with lp being responsible for all north america sales from this facility 
the joint venture with canfor commenced manufacturing operations as of november the results of this operation are included in our osb segment 
in november  we sold some of our i joist manufacturing equipment to our joint venture with abitibi consolidated to construct and operate an i joist facility in eastern canada 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  each company owns of the venture 
during  this venture commenced operations 
the operating results of this venture improved in in  we initiated the construction of a second i joist facility with abitibi consolidated that commenced operations in october the results of these operations are included in the ewp segment 
discontinued operations included in discontinued operations for  and are the results of the operations of mills that have been divested under our divesture plans 
these operations include our plywood  lumber  vinyl and industrial panels mills  wholesale operation and our distribution business 
the results of operations for these locations are as follows increase decrease year ended december  in millions sales operating profits losses compared to overall  sales for these operations declined significantly in as compared to this decline is primarily related to timing on the sale  transfer or permanent closure of locations 
during  we sold one lumber mill  two previously closed sites and our vinyl operations 
included in the operating losses of discontinued operations for are impairment charges of million  which we recorded to reduce the carrying values of these assets to their estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell  and a gain of million on the sale of the lumber mill and previous closed sites 
compared to overall  sales for these operations declined significantly in as compared to this decline is primarily related to timing on the sale  transfer or permanent closure of locations 
during  we sold two lumber mills and two inter related interior industrial panel facilities 
included in the operating losses of discontinued operations for were impairment charges of million  which we recorded to reduce the carrying values of these assets to their estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell  a loss of million associated with the settlement of an existing liability related to an operating lease on one of our facilities and a gain of million on long term timber contracts associated with our divested facilities 
additionally  we recorded a loss of million on the sale of these assets  including two inter related industrial panel facilities and a lumber mill 
we recognized a million gain associated with the liquidation of certain lifo inventories due to reduced log and lumber inventories at sites sold or closed 
income taxes in total  we recorded a tax provision of million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   the primary differences between the us statutory rate of and the effective rate on our income from continuing operations relate to deduction related to income attributed to united states production activities under the ajca  interest deductible for income tax purposes that is eliminated in the consolidation process and the reversal of previously recorded accruals for taxes in connection with our repatriation of accumulated earnings from our canadian subsidiary 
in and  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to revisions to estimates recorded in prior years  state income taxes and the effects of foreign exchange gains and losses that were taxable but were eliminated in the consolidation process 
we have paid approximately million in cash taxes for and expect to pay an additional million for during  lp completed its plans to repatriate accumulated earnings from its canadian subsidiary to the us under the provisions of the ajca 
lp repatriated approximately million of canadian earnings in the fourth quarter of and will pay approximately million in us federal and state income taxes with respect to the distribution and an additional million  net of tax benefit  in canadian withholding taxes 
because of this repatriation  we reversed million of deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior years 
defined benefit pension plans we maintain several qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans in the us and canada that cover a substantial portion of our employees 
we account for all of these plans and provide aggregated disclosures about these plans in the notes to our financial statements as required by sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
employers accounting and settlement and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits and sfas no 
employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits revised 
see note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
we estimate that our defined benefit pension expense for will be approximately million 
that estimate assumes that we have no curtailment or settlement expenses in if a curtailment or settlement does occur in  this estimate may change significantly 
we estimate that we will contribute approximately million to million to these plans in at december   we have an unrecognized loss of million associated with our defined benefit pension plans  largely due to lower than expected asset returns and discount rates which were lower than previously assumed 
the amortization of this unrecognized loss will account for approximately of our estimated pension expense 
the calculation of defined benefit pension plan expense is based on numerous actuarial assumptions 
our pension expense is most sensitive to changes in our assumptions regarding the long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
for our us plans  which account for more than of the total assets of our defined benefit plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the pension expense 
this assumption is based on information supplied by our plan advisors for our us plans based on the expected returns on the portfolio of assets in those plans 
we will continue to monitor the expected long term rate of return of our pension plan investments and adjust our assumed rate of return as necessary 
we have added real return  absolute return and real estate investments to the portfolio to improve returns and reduce volatility 
additionally  to reduce the impact of market value fluctuations on the pension expense  we use an asset smoothing method that recognizes annual investment gains and losses over four years 
a change of in the long term rate of return assumption would change our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of at october   which is our measurement date 
this rate is intended to reflect the rates at which the obligations could be effectively settled at that date 
we use corporate bond yields published by a recognized financial institution as an indicator of potential settlement rates 
the projected payment for each year is discounted using the rates specified by the yield curve 
the sum of these discounted payments is the benefit obligation 
the discount rate disclosed is the single rate applied to all projected payments that creates an equivalent obligation 
more than of our total benefit obligations are related to our us pension plans 
the rate from the october  measurement date of was used in the determination of the pension expense 
a change of in the discount rate assumption would change our estimated pension expense by approximately million

in order to borrow funds in a cost effective manner i the notes receivable were contributed by us to a qualified special purpose entity qspe as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  ii the qspe issued to unrelated third parties bonds supported by a bank letter of credit and the qspe s reimbursement obligations which are secured by the notes receivable  and iii the qspe distributed to lp  as a return of capital  substantially all of the proceeds realized by the qspe from the issuance of its bonds 
the qspe has no sources of liquidity other than the notes receivable 
generally the cash flow generated by the notes receivable will be dedicated to the payment of the bonds issued by the qspe  and the qspe s creditors generally will have no recourse to us for the qspe s obligations subject to the limited exception described below 
pursuant to the arrangement described above  during  we contributed million of the notes receivable to the qspe  the qspe issued million of its bonds to unrelated third parties and distributed million to lp as a return of capital

the qspe s assets have been removed from our control and are not available to satisfy claims of our creditors except to the extent of our retained interest  if any  remaining after the claims of qspe s creditors are satisfied 
in general  the creditors of the qspe have no recourse to our assets  other than our retained interest 
however  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for certain liabilities of the qspe including liabilities associated with the marketing or remarketing of its bonds and reimbursement obligations associated with the letter of credit supporting the bonds in an amount not to exceed of the aggregate principal amount of the notes receivable pledged by the qspe 
our maximum exposure in this regard was approximately million as of december  as discussed previously  we have an accounts receivable secured borrowing program 
l p receivables corporation lprc is our wholly owned subsidiary and is the special purpose entity into which the receivables of participating domestic subsidiaries are sold 
lprc  in turn  sells an interest in the receivables to various banks and entities 
this program is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
the receivables outstanding under these programs and the corresponding debt  if any  are included as both receivables and long term debt in our financial statements included in item of this report

dividends for totaled million 
on february   we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend for the first quarter of to per share paid on march  potential impairments we continue to review certain operations for potential impairments 
management currently believes we have adequate support for the carrying value of each of these assets based upon the anticipated cash flows that result from our estimates of future demand  pricing and production costs assuming certain levels of planned capital expenditures 
however  should the markets for our products deteriorate to levels significantly below cycle average pricing or should we decide to invest capital in alternative projects  it is possible that we will be required to record further impairment charges 
we also review from time to time possible dispositions of various assets in light of current and anticipated economic and industry conditions  our strategic plan and other relevant circumstances 
because a determination to dispose of particular assets can require management to make assumptions regarding the transaction structure of the disposition and to estimate the net sales proceeds  which may be less than previous estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows  we may be required to record impairment charges in connection with decisions to dispose of assets

we historically have not entered into material currency rate hedges with respect to our exposure from operations  although we may do so in the future 
some of our products are sold as commodities and therefore sales prices fluctuate daily based on market factors over which we have little or no control 
the most significant commodity product we sell is osb 
based upon an assumed annual production capacity of billion square feet basis or billion square feet basis  a change in the annual average price on basis would change annual pre tax profits by approximately million
