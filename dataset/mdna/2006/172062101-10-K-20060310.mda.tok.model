the risks and uncertainties below are not the only ones we face 
there are additional risks and uncertainties that we currently do not believe are material 
there also may be risk and uncertainties of which we are not aware 
if any risks or uncertainties discussed here develop into actual events  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the market price of our common stock could decline materially 
readers should carefully consider this information together with the other information we have provided in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the securities and exchange commission as well as news releases and other information we disseminate publicly 
we rely exclusively on independent insurance agents to distribute our products 
we market our products through independent  non exclusive insurance agents 
these agents are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors products 
we must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agencies and their clients 
we need to maintain good relationships with the agencies that market our products 
if we do not  these agencies may market our competitors products instead of ours  which may lead to us having a less desirable mix of business  which could affect our results of operations 
events or conditions that could diminish a competitive advantage that our independent agencies enjoy downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 
we believe our strong insurer financial strength ratings  in particular the a rating from am best of our property casualty insurance subsidiaries  are an important competitive advantage 
only other insurance groups  or percent of all insurance groups  qualify for the a  am best s highest rating 
if our property casualty ratings were downgraded  our agents might find it more difficult to market our products or might choose to emphasize the products of other carriers  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
concerns that doing business with us is difficult or perceptions that our level of service is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace 
if agents or policyholders believed that we were no longer providing the prompt  reliable personal service that has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our insurance operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
delays in the development  implementation  performance and benefits of technology projects and enhancements or independent agent perceptions that our technology solutions are inadequate to match their needs 
a reduction in the number of independent agencies marketing our products  the failure of these agencies to successfully market our products or the choice of these agencies to reduce their writings of our products could reduce our revenues and our results of operations if we were unable to replace them with agencies that produce adequate premiums 
further  policyholders may choose a competitor s product rather than our own because of real or perceived differences in price  terms and conditions  coverage or service 
if the quality of the independent agencies with which we do business were to decline  that also might cause policyholders to purchase their insurance through different agencies or channels 
increased comfort in internet purchasing could further reduce independent agencies writings of personal lines products 
please see item  our business and our strategy  page  for a discussion of our relationships with independent insurance agents 
competition could adversely affect our ability to sell policies at rates we deem adequate 
the insurance industry is highly competitive 
competition in our insurance business is based on many factors  including competitiveness of premiums charged underwriting and pricing methodologies that allow insurers to identify and flexibly price risks underwriting discipline terms and conditions of insurance coverage rate at which products are brought to market k page 
table of contents technological innovation ability to control expenses adequacy of financial strength ratings by independent ratings agencies such as am best quality of services provided to agents and policyholders if we were unable to compete effectively because of one or more of these factors  our premium writings could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
please see item  commercial lines  personal lines and life insurance results of operations  page  page  and page  for a discussion of our competitive position in the insurance marketplace 
managing technology initiatives and meeting new data security requirements are significant challenges 
while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations  technology initiatives present short term cost and implementation risks 
in addition  we may have inaccurate expense projections  implementation schedules or expectations regarding the efficacy of the end product 
these issues could escalate over time 
data security is subject to increasing regulation 
we face rising costs and competing time constraints in meeting compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations 
computer viruses  hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches 
these increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements could expose us to data loss  damages and significant increases in compliance costs 
please see item  technology solutions  page  for a discussion of our technology initiatives 
the effects of emerging or latent claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that could be affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
the effects of such unforeseeable emerging and latent claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our results of operations 
please see item  property casualty and life insurance reserves  page and page  for a discussion of our reserving practices 
our loss reserves  our largest liability  are based on estimates and could be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
our financial statements are prepared using gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
for a discussion of the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements and the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting policies  please refer to item  property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves  page  and
