item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  and estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if our equipment sales involve sales to our existing customers who have previously accepted the same type s of equipment with the same type s of specifications  we account for the product sales as a multiple element arrangement 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate accounting units based on the residual method 
under the residual method  the revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue allocated to delivered elements 
we recognize the equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 
the other multiple elements also include installation  service contracts and training 
equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and published or quoted service labor rates and is recognized when the installation has been completed and the equipment has been accepted by the customer 
training revenue is valued based on published training class prices or quoted rates and is recognized when the customers complete the training classes or when a customer specific training period has expired 
the published or quoted service labor rates and training class prices are rates actually charged and billed to our customers 
all other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
future revenues may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet customer specific acceptance criteria 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery based on the inco terms 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of such contracts 

table of contents the timing and amount of revenue recognized depends on whether revenue is recognized upon shipment versus acceptance 
for revenue recognized upon acceptance  it is dependent upon when customer specific criteria are met 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or another valuation technique 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of august  product warranty estimation we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  releases of new products and other factors 
the warranty periods for new equipment manufactured by us range from six months to two years 
special warranty reserves are also accrued for major rework campaigns 
although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as of yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
inventory reserves estimation we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives  forecasted sales demand and recoverability 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of the industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry or by us 
since we recorded the pss product inventory reserves as a result of the wind down of our microlithography business in the second quarter of fiscal  we have had sales of pss product inventory that had previously been written down to zero and reductions in inventory buyback requirements of million and have disposed of million of pss product inventory 
the original cost of pss product inventory available for sale or to be disposed of as of august  that has been written down to zero was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in the financial condition of a significant customer who is not considered in the allowance 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible 
accounts receivable are charged off after management determines that they are uncollectible 
during fiscal  we collected  of receivables that had previously been written off resulting in a credit to selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents stock based compensation we implemented the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r effective august  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted on or after august  and for previously granted awards not yet vested as of august  we utilize a black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of each award on the date of grant 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve management judgment 
key assumptions that affect the calculation of fair value include the expected life of stock based awards and our stock price volatility 
additionally  we expense for only those shares expected to vest 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards and the forfeiture rate of such awards reflect management s best estimates 
however  circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions that materially impact the fair value determination of future awards or their estimated rate of forfeiture 
if factors change and we use different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period 
see note under the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on stock based compensation 
income taxes our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established valuation allowances against a portion of the us and us net operating losses to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the realizability of our net operating losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such estimates may differ 
the valuation allowance can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining our contingent tax liabilities 
we have established contingent tax liabilities using management s best judgment and adjust these liabilities as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our tax liabilities in any given period could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows for that period 
industry update gartner group  a leading research organization  is forecasting that demand for semiconductors will increase approximately percent to billion in calendar from billion in the prior year 
the increase is being driven by memory  optoelectronics and assp application specific standard product device demand 
semiconductor demand is forecasted to grow approximately percent to billion in calendar gartner group is forecasting equipment spending in calendar to increase approximately to billion as compared to approximately billion in calendar currently  analysts have a mixed view on calendar forecasted equipment spending  ranging from a small decline to a modest increase  with a return to double digit growth in calendar when compared to prior cycles  device manufacturers are managing capacity increases carefully and acting quickly to delay new equipment purchases in response to slowing demand to prevent an inventory build up 
device manufacturers ability to more quickly respond to changes in demand for their product should have a dampening effect on future industry cycles 
we continue to monitor our extensive list of order opportunities 
with one or more of our flagship products placed at many of the top semiconductor device manufacturers  we are benefiting from some of these insertions 
assuming that we execute well on existing and new evaluation opportunities  we believe we are in position to participate as these leading device manufacturers continue to add capacity in calendar 
table of contents results of operations for the fiscal year ended august   we had net losses of million as compared to net losses of million for the fiscal year ended august  for fiscal  we had losses from operations of million as compared to losses from operations of million in fiscal the increase in net losses in fiscal related to gains on marketable securities of million in fiscal partially offset by improved operations related to increased sales revenue in fiscal while improved industry conditions contributed to our improved orders and financial performance in fiscal  we also progressed on many of the strategies we established at the beginning of the year  including establishing a tool of record status at new customers while broadening our product position at several existing customers  deploying best known methods for several targeted process applications while expanding the overall applications capabilities of our flagship products  increased the frequency of technology roadmap exchanges with key customers while initiating a plan to conduct our successful knowledge services tm seminar in other regions of the world  and reported a sequential improvement in our quarterly financial performance in fiscal with a return to profitability in the fourth quarter 
we now have one or more of our flagship products placed at of the top semiconductor manufacturers  ranked by calendar spending  and anticipate follow on high volume manufacturing orders from several of these customers in fiscal sales revenue and shipments fiscal sales revenues increased to million as compared to million in fiscal sales increased in all regions with increases in asia of million and the united states of million 
the increases in fiscal related primarily to improved industry conditions 
fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million for fiscal the majority of the decrease in fiscal sales revenue as compared to fiscal related to a decrease in domestic shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal related primarily to our transformation  beginning in march  from the microlithography business to a polaris systems and services product group 
shipments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal based upon our revenue recognition policy  certain shipments to customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
therefore  depending on timing of shipments and customer acceptances  there are time periods where shipments may exceed sales revenue or due to timing of acceptances  sales revenue may exceed shipments 
international sales were million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  and million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal international sales through our affiliate  m fsi ltd  represented approximately of international sales during fiscal and of international sales during fiscal international sales through our affiliates m fsi ltd and metron technology represented of international sales during fiscal the dollar increase in international sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to increases in all regions  with the most significant increase in asia due to improved industry conditions 
the increase in the percentage of international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to the decrease in domestic sales revenue 
the increase in international sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to our transition to a direct global distribution model in march as well as improved industry conditions in international markets 
due to its broader customer 
table of contents base  sc products have a higher percentage of international sales than pss products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future periods 
as a result of the fiscal year end backlog  deferred revenue levels and anticipated orders of to million in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect first quarter fiscal revenue to be in the range of to million 
achieving the high end of the revenue range requires receiving purchase orders and obtaining timely acceptance from customers for products that have been shipped 
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates due to a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the geographic mix of products sold  initial product placement discounts  utilization of manufacturing capacity  the sales of pss product inventory previously written down to zero  and the competitive pricing environment 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in gross margins from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in the amount of the original cost of pss product inventory sold that has been written down to zero from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  as well as an increase in our capacity utilization associated with higher shipment levels of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increases were partially offset by lower margins on flagship products that were sold at a discount in order to gain market entry 
the decrease in margins from fiscal to fiscal related primarily to an increase in manufacturing variances associated with the decrease in shipments from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease also related to the increase in the percentage of international sales as well as a decrease in the amount of the original cost of pss product inventory sold that had been written down to zero from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we will continue to try to sell the pss product inventory that had previously been written down to zero to our customers as spares  refurbished systems and upgrades to existing systems 
if unsuccessful  some of the items will be disposed 
any material sales of the impaired inventory will be disclosed 
since we recorded the pss product inventory reserves as a result of the wind down of our microlithography business in the second quarter of fiscal  we have had sales of pss product inventory that had previously been written down to zero and reductions in inventory buyback requirements of million and have disposed of million of pss product inventory 
the original cost of pss product inventory available for sale or to be disposed of as of august  was million 
we expect the gross profit margins for the first quarter of fiscal to be between to of revenues  due to an anticipated change in product mix and lower margins on the initial placement of our products at strategic customers 
our factory utilization is not expected to change significantly  as first quarter of fiscal shipments are expected to be in the range of to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in fiscal and million  or of total sales  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to million of stock compensation expense which was new in fiscal  depreciation of our crm system and increased sales and marketing expenses due to higher sales 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal related to the increase in sales 
the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal related primarily to the million expense incurred in fiscal to settle a patent infringement lawsuit in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease also related to a 
table of contents decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million primarily due to our sap computer software system being fully depreciated in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salary expense associated with salary increases in january selling  general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million  as we increase our personnel resources to support a direct presence in israel 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in fiscal and million  or of total sales  in fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to our broadening the application capabilities of our products and supporting initial product placements at customers 
in addition  we experienced an increase in engineering costs as we prepared for and shipped our first single wafer wet cleaning system in the fourth quarter of fiscal the minor decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the net impact of a million decrease in intangible asset amortization expense associated with our fiscal acquisition of yieldup  offset by an increase in salary expense associated with salary increases in january and costs associated with new product development 
we expect research and development expenses to range from million to million for the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to invest in new applications and product development programs and support our initial single wafer wet product 
gain on sale of facility we sold our facility in allen  texas in the second quarter of fiscal and received million in net cash proceeds from the sale 
the building and property  plant and equipment sold had a financial statement carrying value of approximately million at the close of the sale

subsequent to the merger announcement  we were contacted by the majority shareholder and given the option of selling our shares at a nominal value to the majority shareholder or providing additional debt to the foundry as part of a pre merger restructuring 
based on this information  we deemed the investment as being fully impaired as of february  and recorded a loss of million in the second quarter of fiscal the company sold its shares at a nominal value to the majority shareholder during the third quarter of fiscal income tax expense we recorded a tax expense of  in fiscal  and  primarily as a result of state taxes 

table of contents our deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved for with a valuation allowance 
we do not expect to reduce our valuation allowance until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million at august   which will begin to expire in fiscal through fiscal if not utilized 
of this amount  approximately million is subject to internal revenue code section limitations on utilization  which limits the amount that we can offset taxable income to approximately million per year 
equity in losses earnings of affiliate equity in losses earnings of affiliates was approximately  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the losses in fiscal related primarily to a decrease in m fsi ltd sales as well as a change in product mix 
the decrease in fiscal earnings related to increased product development investments by m fsi ltd

subsequent to year end  we entered into a capital lease with minimum lease payments of  due within twelve months and  due in one to three years 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures to be less than million in the first quarter of fiscal  including the acceptance of a new particle counter  financed through a capital lease  that will be used for applications development in our sc lab 
depreciation and amortization is expected to be between approximately million and million in the first quarter of fiscal at the expected revenue and expense run rate  we anticipate using to million of cash for operations in the first quarter of fiscal this cash usage assumes that we will reduce our current inventory levels and experience an increase in accounts receivable from the fiscal year end level 
we believe that with existing cash  cash receipts  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet our currently projected working capital requirements  and to meet other cash requirements through at least fiscal we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
we may fund such activities with additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  whether to maintain flexibility or to meet strategic objectives  could result in additional dilution to our shareholders

new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement was effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in our first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this statement did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which 
table of contents an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  and we adopted this standard august  using the modified prospective method 
beginning in fiscal  our results of operations reflected compensation expense for new stock options granted under our stock incentive plan  and for the unvested portion of previous stock options granted 
we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for us beginning in fiscal year we are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures 
sab no 
is effective as of the end of fiscal year  allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of august  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab no 
we are currently evaluating the impact sab no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
as of august   our investments in affiliate included a interest in m fsi ltd  which operates in japan 
we denominate the majority of our sales outside of the us in us dollars 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we have and will continue to incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rate risks 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction gains and losses for fiscal were insignificant 
we are currently evaluating various hedging activities and other options to minimize these risks 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates 
we had no outstanding indebtedness as of august  as of the end of fiscal  amortized cost approximated market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the impact on loss before income taxes of a change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of august
