forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained in this report  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may  objective  outlook  plan  project  possible  potential  should and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including the availability of credit and its impact on capital expenditures and the ability of xcel energy and its subsidiaries to obtain financing on favorable terms  business conditions in the energy industry  actions of credit rating agencies  competitive factors  including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by xcel energy and its subsidiaries  unusual weather  effects of geopolitical events  including war and acts of terrorism  state  federal and foreign legislative and regulatory initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery  have an impact on rates or have an impact on asset operation or ownership  structures that affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the electric and natural gas markets  the higher risk associated with xcel energy s nonregulated businesses compared with its regulated businesses  costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims  actions of accounting regulatory bodies  the items described under factors affecting results of continuing operations  and the other risk factors listed from time to time by xcel energy in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  including risk factors in item a of xcel energy s annual report on form k for the year ended dec 
 and exhibit to xcel energy s annual report on form k for the year ended dec 
 management s strategic plan xcel energy s strategy  which we call building the core  is to invest in our core utility businesses and earn the return authorized by our regulatory commissions 
we plan to invest approximately billion over the next five years in our core operations to grow our business in response to an increase in customer demand 
we anticipate a need for additional energy supply in both colorado and minnesota during the next years 
additionally  we continue to focus on enhancing the reliability of our electrical system  which includes making significant investment in our transmission and distribution systems 
over the past five years  we ve divested businesses or subsidiaries that were not closely linked to our core electric and natural gas businesses  realizing cash proceeds of nearly million 
today  we re a vertically integrated utility and we intend to stay that way 
our strategy of building the core has three phases 
the first phase is obtaining legislative and regulatory support for our large investment initiatives prior to making the investment 
to avoid excessive risk for the company  it is critical to reduce regulatory uncertainty before making large capital investments 
we accomplished this for both the metropoliton emission reduction project merp in minnesota and the comanche coal plant in colorado 
transmission legislation has been passed in minnesota  allowing that state s regulatory commission to approve recovery for transmission investments without filing a general rate case 
in texas  the legislature authorized annual recovery for transmission infrastructure improvements 
both pieces of legislation will support necessary new investment in our transmission system 
the second phase is making those investments 
in a normal year  we spend approximately billion on capital projects 
in addition to our base level of capital investment  we expect to spend approximately billion on merp and billion on comanche through as a result of these investments  as well as continued investments in our transmission and distribution system  to ensure continued reliability and to meet our customer growth requirements  we expect that our rate base  or the amount on which we earn a return  will grow annually by slightly more than percent on average 
finally  such investments will always be made with a clear focus on optimizing environmental protection  a significant priority for xcel energy 
the third phase is earning a fair return on our investments 
to ensure that we earn a fair return  our regulatory strategy is to receive regulatory approval for rate riders as well as general rate cases 
a rate rider is a mechanism that allows us to recover certain costs and returns on investments without the costs and delays of filing a rate case 
these riders allow for timely revenue recovery and are good mechanisms to recover the costs of large projects or other costs that vary over time 
as an example  a rider for merp went into effect in january  allowing us to earn a return on the project while the facility is being constructed 
we also are filing general rate cases to increase revenue recovery in most of the states in which we operate 
in  we filed several rate cases as part of our regulatory strategy 
these rate cases  and others that we plan to file in  are some of the building blocks of our earnings growth plan 
following is the current status of these initiatives we reached constructive decisions in the colorado natural gas case and wisconsin electric and natural gas cases  which will increase revenue in see factors affecting results of continuing operations for further discussion 
we are on track with the minnesota electric case  where interim rates  subject to refund  went into effect in january we expect a decision in the third quarter of this year 
later in the year we plan to file electric cases in colorado  texas  new mexico  and possibly north dakota and south dakota 
if we are successful  these cases should increase revenue and earnings in our regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable rate requests designed to provide recovery of legitimate expenses and a return on our utility investments 
we believe that our commissions will provide us with reasonable recovery  and it s important to note that our financial plans include this assumption 
recent constructive results  along with past rulings  are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and give us confidence that we are pursuing the right strategy 
with any strategic plan  there are goals and objectives 
we feel the following financial objectives are both realistic and achievable annual earnings per share growth rate target of percent to percent from  annual dividend increases of percent to percent  and senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the bbb to a range 
successful execution of our building the core strategic plan should allow us to achieve our financial objectives  which in turn should provide investors with an attractive total return on a low risk investment 
financial review the following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on xcel energy s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented  or are expected to have a material impact in the future 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes 
all note references refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
summary of financial results the following table summarizes the earnings contributions of xcel energy s business segments on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
continuing operations consist of the following regulated utility subsidiaries  operating in the electric and natural gas segments  and several nonregulated subsidiaries and the holding company  where corporate financing activity occurs 
discontinued operations consist of the following quixx corp  which was classified as held for sale in the third quarter of based on a decision to divest this investment  utility engineering corp  which was sold in april  seren  a portion of which was sold in november with the remainder sold in january  viking and bmg  which were sold in  cheyenne  which was sold in january  nrg  which emerged from bankruptcy and was divested in late  and xcel energy international and e prime  which were classified as held for sale in late based on the decision to divest them 
certain items in the statements of operations have been reclassified from prior period presentation to conform to the presentation

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
earnings from continuing operations for were lower than in the results had higher operating margins  which were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses  including scheduled nuclear plant outages in  higher employee benefit costs  higher uncollectible receivable expense and higher depreciation expense 
in addition  tax expense recorded in was higher than  primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded in related to the successful resolution of various income tax audit issues 
while earnings from continuing operations for were flat compared with  results were favorably impacted by electric sales growth  short term wholesale markets and lower depreciation  offset by the negative impact of unfavorable weather  legal settlement costs and the impact of certain regulatory accruals  compared with the same period in income from discontinued operations in includes the positive impact of a million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of xcel energy s divested interest in nrg 
this was partially offset by seren s operating losses during the loss from discontinued operations in is largely due to an after tax impairment charge of million  or cents per share  related to seren 
in addition  the loss from discontinued operations in is attributable in part to an after tax loss of million  or cents per share  associated with the disposition of cheyenne 
the earnings in from discontinued operations are primarily due to an adjustment to previously estimated tax benefits related to xcel energy s write off of its investment in nrg 
results from discontinued operations are discussed in the discontinued operations section later 
weather xcel energy s earnings can be significantly affected by weather 
unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales  but also can increase expenses 
unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales  but may not reduce expenses 
the impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers  temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically has used per degree of temperature 
the following summarizes the estimated impact on the earnings of the utility subsidiaries of xcel energy due to temperature variations from historical averages weather in increased earnings by an estimated cents per share  weather in decreased earnings by an estimated cents per share  and weather in was close to normal and had minimal impact on earnings per share 
statement of operations analysis continuing operations the following discussion summarizes the items that affected the individual revenue and expense items reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
electric utility  short term wholesale and commodity trading margins electric fuel and purchased power expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power 
due to fuel and purchased energy cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers in several states  most fluctuations in these costs do not materially affect electric utility margin 
xcel energy has two distinct forms of wholesale sales short term wholesale and commodity trading 
short term wholesale refers to energy related purchase and sales activity  and the use of certain financial instruments associated with the fuel required for  and energy produced from  xcel energy s generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load 
commodity trading is not associated with xcel energy s generation assets or the energy and capacity purchased to serve native load 
short term wholesale and commodity trading activities are considered part of the electric utility segment 
short term wholesale and commodity trading margins reflect the estimated impact of regulatory sharing  if applicable 
commodity trading revenues are reported net of related costs ie  on a margin basis in the consolidated statements of operations 
commodity trading costs include purchased power  transmission  broker fees and other related costs 
the following table details the revenue and margin for base electric utility  short term wholesale and commodity trading activities millions of dollars base electric utility short term wholesale commodity trading consolidated totals electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue electric utility revenue excluding commodity trading fuel and purchased power commodity trading revenue commodity trading costs gross margin before operating expenses margin as a percentage of revenue the following summarizes the components of the changes in base electric utility revenue and base electric utility margin for the years ended dec

these increases were partially offset by higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms 
comparison to base electric utility margin decreased due to the impact of weather  higher fuel and purchased energy costs not recovered through direct pass through recovery mechanisms  and regulatory accruals associated with potential customer refunds related to service quality obligations in colorado and fuel reconciliation proceedings in texas 
these decreases were partially offset by weather normalized sales growth 
short term wholesale and commodity trading margin comparison to short term wholesale and commodity trading margins decreased million for compared with the higher results reflect the impact of more favorable market conditions and higher levels of surplus generation available to sell 
in addition  a preexisting contract contributed million of margin in the first quarter of and expired at that time 
comparison to short term wholesale and commodity trading margins increased approximately million in compared with the increase reflects a number of market factors  including higher market prices and additional resources available for sale and the pre existing contract described above 
natural gas utility margins the following table details the changes in natural gas utility revenue and margin 
the cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the unit cost of wholesale natural gas purchases 
however  due to purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for sales to retail customers  fluctuations in the wholesale cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin

non fuel operating expenses and other items other utility operating and maintenance expenses other operating and maintenance expenses for increased by approximately million  or percent  compared with an outage at the monticello nuclear plant and higher outage costs at prairie island in increased costs by approximately million 
employee benefit costs were higher in  primarily due to increased pension benefits and long term disability costs 
also contributing to the increase was higher uncollectible receivable costs  attributable in part  to modifications to the bankruptcy laws  higher fuel prices and certain changes in the credit and collection process 
other operating and maintenance expenses for increased by approximately million  or percent  compared with of the increase  million was incurred to assist with the storm damage repair in florida and was offset by increased revenue 
the remaining increase of million is primarily due to higher electric service reliability costs  higher information technology costs  higher plant related costs  higher costs related to a customer billing system conversion and increased costs primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the higher costs were partially offset by lower employee benefit and compensation costs and lower nuclear plant outage costs

other nonregulated operating and maintenance expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared with this decrease resulted from the dissolution of planergy international and the discontinued consolidation of an investment in an independent power producing entity that was no longer majority owned after the divestiture of nrg 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased by approximately million  or percent  compared with the changes were primarily due to the installation of new steam generators at unit of the prairie island nuclear plant and software system additions  both of which have relatively short depreciable lives compared with other capital additions 
the prairie island steam generators are being depreciated over the remaining life of the plant operating license  which expires in in addition  the minnesota renewable development fund and renewable cost recovery amortization  which is recovered in revenue as a non fuel rider and does not have an impact on net income  increased over the increase was partially offset by the changes in useful lives and net salvage rates approved by minnesota regulators in august depreciation and amortization expense for decreased by million  or percent  compared with the reduction is largely due to several regulatory decisions 
in  as a result of a minnesota public utilities commission mpuc order  nsp minnesota modified its decommissioning expense recognition  which served to reduce decommissioning accruals by approximately million in compared with in addition  effective july   the colorado public utilities commission cpuc lengthened the depreciable lives of certain electric utility plant at psco as a part of the general colorado rate case  reducing annual depreciation expense by million 
psco experienced the full impact of the annual reduction in  resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of million for compared with these decreases were partially offset by plant additions 
interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense net decreased million in compared with the decrease is due to interest income related to the finalization of prior period irs audits of million in  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of water rights in interest and other income  net of nonoperating expenses increased million in compared with the increase is due mostly to interest income related to the finalization of prior period irs audits of million 
interest and financing costs the interest charges and financing costs increased approximately million  or percent when compared with  primarily due to increased short term borrowing levels 
the interest charges and financing costs decreased approximately million  or percent when compared with the decrease for the year reflects savings from refinancing higher coupon debt during and lower credit line fees  partially offset by interest expense related to prior period irs audits 
income tax expense the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was percent for  compared with percent in income taxes recorded in reflect tax benefits of million  primarily from increased research credits and a net operating loss carry back 
excluding the tax benefits  the effective rate for would have been percent 
in  income tax benefits of million were recorded  which included million related to the successful resolution of various audit issues and other adjustments to current and deferred taxes 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations was percent for  compared with percent for the same period in excluding the tax benefits  the effective rate for would have been percent

the sale was completed in january and resulted in an after tax loss of approximately million  or cents per share  which was accrued in december during  xcel energy sold viking and bmg 
after tax disposal gains of million  or cents per share  were recorded  primarily related to the sale of viking 
xcel energy recorded minimal income related to viking in  due to its sale in january of that year 
nrg results discontinued operations xcel energy s share of nrg results for is shown as a component of discontinued operations due to nrg s emergence from bankruptcy in december and xcel energy s corresponding divestiture of its ownership interest in nrg 
xcel energy financial statements do not contain any results of nrg operations in and nrg s results included in xcel energy s earnings for were as follows millions of dollars six months ended june  total nrg loss losses not recorded by xcel energy under the equity method equity in losses of nrg included in xcel energy results for these represent nrg losses incurred in the first and second quarters of that were in excess of the amounts recordable by xcel energy under the equity method of accounting limitations 
as of the bankruptcy filing date may   xcel energy had recognized million of nrg s impairments and related charges as these charges were recorded by nrg prior to may  consequently  xcel energy recorded its equity in nrg results in excess of its financial commitment to nrg under the settlement agreement reached in march among xcel energy  nrg and nrg s creditors 
these excess losses were reversed upon nrg s emergence from bankruptcy in december other nonregulated results discontinued operations in april  zachry group  inc acquired all of the outstanding shares of ue  a nonregulated subsidiary 
in august  xcel energy s board of directors approved management s plan to pursue the sale of quixx corp  a former subsidiary of ue that partners in cogeneration projects that was not included in the sale of ue to zachry 
as a result  xcel energy is reporting ue and quixx as components of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in september  xcel energy s board of directors approved management s plan to pursue the sale of seren 
as a result of the decision  seren is accounted for as discontinued operations 
in november  xcel energy sold seren s california assets to wavedivision holdings  llc 
in january  xcel energy sold seren s minnesota assets to charter communications 
during  xcel energy s board of directors approved management s plan to exit businesses conducted by e prime and xcel energy international 
e prime ceased conducting business in also during  xcel energy completed the sales of the argentina subsidiaries of xcel energy international 
nonregulated results compared with results of discontinued nonregulated operations in include the impact of a million reduction to the original asset impairment for seren and the positive impact of a million tax benefit recorded to reflect the final resolution of xcel energy s divested interest in nrg 
in  the nrg tax basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by million 
nonregulated results compared with results of discontinued nonregulated operations in include the impact of the sales of the argentina subsidiaries of xcel energy international 
the sales were completed in three transactions  with a total sales price of approximately million 
in addition to the sales price  xcel energy also received approximately million at the closing of one transaction as redemption of its capital investment 
the sales resulted in a gain of approximately million  including approximately million of income tax benefits realizable upon the sale of the xcel energy international assets 
in addition  results from discontinued operations include the impact of an after tax impairment charge for seren  of million  or cents per share 
the impairment charge was recorded based on operating results  market conditions and preliminary feedback from prospective buyers 
tax benefits related to investment in nrg xcel energy has recognized tax benefits related to the divestiture of nrg 
since these tax benefits are related to xcel energy s investment in discontinued nrg operations  they are reported as discontinued operations 
during  xcel energy recognized an initial estimate of the expected tax benefits of million 
based on the results of a preliminary tax basis study of nrg  xcel energy recorded million of additional tax benefits in in  the nrg basis study was updated and previously recognized tax benefits were reduced by million 
in  a million tax benefit was recorded to reflect the final federal income tax resolution of xcel energy s divested interest in nrg 
based on current forecasts of taxable income and tax liabilities  xcel energy expects to realize approximately billion of cash savings from these tax benefits through a refund of taxes paid in prior years and reduced taxes payable in future years 
in  and  xcel energy used million  million  and million  respectively  of these tax benefits  and expects to use million in the remainder of the tax benefit carry forward is expected to be used over subsequent years 
factors affecting results of continuing operations xcel energy s utility revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions  general business conditions and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect xcel energy s ability to recover its costs from customers 
the historical and future trends of xcel energy s operating results have been  and are expected to be  affected by a number of factors  including the following general economic conditions economic conditions may have a material impact on xcel energy s operating results 
the united states economy continues to grow as measured by projected growth in the gross domestic product 
management cannot predict the impact of a future economic slowdown  fluctuating energy prices  terrorist activity  war or the threat of war 
however  xcel energy could experience a material adverse impact to its results of operations  future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a general slowdown in future economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates 
sales growth in addition to the impact of weather  customer sales levels in xcel energy s utility businesses can vary with economic conditions  energy prices  customer usage patterns and other factors 
weather normalized sales growth for retail electric utility customers was percent in compared with  and percent in compared with weather normalized sales growth for firm natural gas utility customers was approximately percent in compared with  and percent in compared with projections indicate that weather normalized sales growth in compared with will range between percent and percent for retail electric utility customers and percent to percent for firm natural gas utility customers 
fuel supply and costs coal deliverability xcel energy s operating utilities have varying dependence on coal fired generation 
at the utilities  coal fired generation comprises between percent and percent of the total annual generation 
approximately percent of the annual coal requirements are supplied from the powder river basin in wyoming 
delivery of coal from the powder river basin has been disrupted by train derailments and other operational problems purportedly caused by deteriorated rail track beds of approximately miles in length in wyoming 
the bnsf railway co 
bnsf and the union pacific railroad uprr jointly own the rail line 
the bnsf operates and maintains the rail line 
the coal delivery issues began in the first half of based on discussions with the railroads  xcel energy expects that disrupted coal deliveries will continue at least through the first part of xcel energy has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of the reduced coal deliveries 
these steps include modifying the dispatch of certain generation facilities to conserve coal inventories 
this modified dispatch was in place during the second half of and has continued in to date 
in response to this reduced coal dispatch  xcel energy has increased purchases from third parties and has increased the use of natural gas for electric generation 
in addition  xcel energy negotiated for the acquisition of additional  higher capacity rail cars and is working to upgrade certain coal handling facilities 
delivery of the new cars began in january and will continue over the course of the year 
the upgrades to the coal handling facilities are expected to be completed in the first half of despite these efforts  coal inventories have declined to below target levels 
while xcel energy has secured  under contract  approximately percent of anticipated coal requirements  it cannot predict the likelihood of receiving the required coal 
while xcel energy is planning to rebuild inventories during the year  there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so 
the ultimate impact of coal availability cannot be fully assessed at this time  but could impact future financial results 
the cost of purchased power and natural gas for electric generation is higher than for coal fired electric generation 
the use of these sources to replace coal fired electric generation increased the price of electricity for retail and wholesale customers 
xcel energy s utility subsidiaries have discussed this situation with their respective state regulatory commissions 
in colorado  psco is subject to a retail electric adjustment clause that recovers fuel  purchased energy and resource costs 
the electric commodity adjustment eca is an incentive adjustment mechanism that compares actual fuel and purchased energy expenses in a calendar year to a benchmark formula 
the benchmark formula increases with natural gas prices  but not necessarily with increased volumes of natural gas usage due to coal supply disruption 
therefore  any disruption in coal supply could adversely affect fuel cost recovery 
for  psco recorded an incentive accrual of million 
the eca provides for an million cap on any cost sharing over or under the allowed eca formula rate 
any cost in excess of the million cap is completely recovered from customers  while any savings in excess of the million cap is completely refunded to customers 
subject to the terms of the eca  psco anticipates it would recover any increased fuel and purchased energy costs greater than the cap from its customers 
natural gas prices in were higher than projected when the eca tariff rates were set in january on oct 
  psco filed an application to adjust the eca rate for november and december to reduce the eca deferred balance and to update its projection of natural gas prices 
this application was granted  which resulted in an increase to electric revenue of approximately million  including unbilled revenues 
as of dec 
  psco was carrying a deferred eca balance  including unbilled revenue  of approximately million 
in texas  fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered through a fixed fuel and purchased energy recovery factor  which is part of sps retail electric rates 
if sps will materially over recover or under recover these costs  the factor may be revised upon application by sps or action by the public utility commission of texas puct 
the regulations require surcharging of under recovered amounts  including interest  when they exceed percent of sps annual fuel and purchased energy costs  as allowed by the puct  if the condition is expected to continue 
on dec 
 sps reached a settlement with various parties that set the fuel surcharge request at million  to be recovered over a month period 
the puct approved this settlement on feb 
  and the surcharge went into effect feb 
 in new mexico  increases and decreases in fuel and purchased energy costs  including deferred amounts  are recovered through a monthly fuel and purchased power clause with a two month lag 
wholesale customers  under the federal energy regulatory commission ferc jurisdiction also pay a monthly fuel cost adjustment calculated on actual fuel and purchased power costs in accordance with the ferc s fuel clause regulations 
while sps believes that it should be allowed to recover these higher costs  the ultimate success of recovery could significantly impact the future of sps and possibly xcel energy 
nsp minnesota s retail electric rate schedules in the minnesota  north dakota and south dakota jurisdictions include a fuel clause adjustment fca to billings and revenues for changes in prudently incurred cost of fuel  fuel related items and purchased energy 
nsp minnesota is permitted to recover these costs through fca mechanisms individually approved by the regulators in each jurisdiction 
the fca mechanisms allow nsp minnesota to bill customers for the cost of fuel and fuel related items used to generate electricity at its plants and energy purchased from other suppliers 
in general  capacity costs are not recovered through the fca 
nsp minnesota s electric wholesale customers also have a fca provision in their contracts 
nsp minnesota anticipates it will recover increased costs resulting from its mitigation plan through the fca 
in wisconsin  nsp wisconsin does not have an automatic electric fuel clause adjustment for wisconsin retail customers 
nsp wisconsin may seek deferred accounting treatment and future rate recovery of increased costs due to an emergency event  if that event causes fuel and purchased power costs to exceed the amount included in rates on an annual basis by more than percent 
coal deliverability has not resulted in an emergency event to date 
natural gas costs a variety of market factors have contributed to significantly higher natural gas prices 
the direct impact of these higher costs is generally mitigated for xcel energy through recovery of such costs from customers through various fuel cost recovery mechanisms 
however  higher fuel costs could significantly impact the results of operations  if requests for recovery are unsuccessful 
in addition  the higher fuel costs could reduce customer demand or increase bad debt expense  which could also have a material impact on xcel energy s results of operations 
delays in the timing of the collection of fuel cost recoveries as compared with expenditures for fuel purchases are expected to have an impact on the cash flows of xcel energy 
xcel energy is unable to predict the future natural gas prices or the ultimate impact of such prices on its results of operations or cash flows 
pension plan costs and assumptions xcel energy s pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions  most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting 
in addition  the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations in the accompanying financial statements 
pension costs have been increasing in recent years  and are expected to increase further over the next several years  due to lower than expected investment returns experienced in prior years and decreases in interest rates used to discount benefit obligations 
while investment returns exceeded the assumed level of percent in  percent in and percent in  investment returns in and were below the assumed level of percent  and discount rates have declined from the percent to percent levels used in the through cost determinations  to percent used in xcel energy continually reviews its pension assumptions and  in  expects to maintain the investment return assumption at percent and to lower the discount rate assumption to percent 
the investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected pension returns assumed on asset levels and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises and recognized over the subsequent five year period 
this gain or loss recognition occurs by using a five year  moving average value of pension assets to measure expected asset returns in the cost determination process  and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the subsequent five year period 
based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses over the next five years  xcel energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes in continuing operations will increase from a credit  or negative expense  of million in to an expense of million in and million in pension costs were a credit in due to the recognized investment asset returns exceeding the other pension cost components  such as benefits earned for current service and interest costs for the effects of the passage of time on discounted obligations 
xcel energy bases its discount rate assumption on benchmark interest rates from moody s investors service moody s  and has consistently benchmarked the interest rate used to derive the discount rate to the movements in the long term corporate bond indices for bonds rated aaa through baa by moody s  which have a period to maturity comparable to our projected benefit obligations 
at dec 
  the annualized moody s baa index rate was percent  and the aaa index rate was percent 
accordingly  xcel energy lowered the discount rate to percent as of dec 
 this rate was used to value the actuarial benefit obligations at that date  and will be used in pension cost determinations 
at dec 
  the annualized moody s baa index rate was percent and the aaa index rate was percent 
the corresponding pension discount rate was percent 
if xcel energy were to use alternative assumptions for pension cost determinations  a percent change would result in the following impact on the estimated pension costs recognized by xcel energy a basis point higher rate of return  percent  would decrease recognized pension costs by million  a basis point lower rate of return  percent  would increase recognized pension costs by million  a basis point higher discount rate  percent  would decrease recognized pension costs by million  and a basis point lower discount rate  percent  would increase recognized pension costs by million 
alternative employee retirement income security act of erisa funding assumptions would also change the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plans 
cash funding requirements can be affected by changes to actuarial assumptions  actual asset levels and other calculations prescribed by the funding requirements of income tax and other pension related regulations 
these regulations did not require cash funding in recent years for xcel energy s pension plans  and do not require funding in assuming that future asset return levels equal the actuarial assumption of percent for the years and  xcel energy projects  under current funding regulations  that no cash funding would be required for or actual performance can affect these funding requirements significantly 
current funding regulations are under legislative review in and  if not retained in their current form  could change these funding requirements materially 
regulation public utility holding company act of puhca historically  xcel energy has been a registered holding company under the puhca 
as a registered holding company  xcel energy  its utility subsidiaries and certain of its nonutility subsidiaries have been subject to extensive regulation by the sec under the puhca with respect to numerous matters  including issuances and sales of securities  acquisitions and sales of certain utility properties  payments of dividends out of capital and surplus  and intra system sales of certain nonpower goods and services 
in addition  the puhca generally limited the ability of registered holding companies to acquire additional public utility systems and to acquire and retain businesses unrelated to the utility operations of the holding company 
on aug 
  president bush signed into law the energy policy act of energy act  significantly changing many federal statutes and repealing the puhca as of feb 
 however  as part of the repeal of the puhca  the ferc was given authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries to the extent relevant to the charges of jurisdictional utilities  authority to review service company cost allocations  and more authority over the merger and acquisition of public utilities 
with the repeal of puhca  state commissions were given similar authority to review the books and records of holding companies and their nonutility subsidiaries 
despite these increases in the ferc s authority  xcel energy believes that the repeal of the puhca will lessen its regulatory burdens and give it more flexibility in the event it were to choose to expand its utility or nonutility businesses 
besides repealing the puhca  the energy act is also expected to have substantial long term effects on energy markets  energy investment and regulation of public utilities and holding company systems by the ferc and doe 
the ferc and the doe are in various stages of rulemaking in implementing the energy policy act 
while the precise impact of these rulemakings cannot be determined at this time  xcel energy generally views the energy act as legislation that will enhance the utility industry going forward 
customer rate regulation the ferc and various state regulatory commissions regulate xcel energy s utility subsidiaries 
decisions by these regulators can significantly impact xcel energy s results of operations 
xcel energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions 
the electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of xcel energy s utility subsidiaries are approved by the ferc and the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate 
the rates are generally designed to recover plant investment  operating costs and an allowed return on investment 
xcel energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions 
because comprehensive general rate changes are requested infrequently in some states  changes in operating costs can affect xcel energy s financial results 
in addition to changes in operating costs  other factors affecting rate filings are new investments  sales growth  conservation and demand side management efforts  and the cost of capital 
in addition  the return on equity authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings 
the most recently authorized electric utility returns are percent for nsp minnesota  percent for nsp wisconsin  percent for psco  and percent for sps 
the most recently authorized natural gas utility returns are percent for nsp minnesota  percent for nsp wisconsin and percent for psco 
wholesale energy market regulation in april  a day wholesale energy market operated by the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso was implemented to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system 
miso now centrally issues bills and payments for many costs formerly incurred directly by nsp minnesota and nsp wisconsin 
both bills and payments from miso for participation in this centrally dispatched market are received  resulting in a net cost in serving xcel energy s native load obligation 
this net result is recorded as a component of operating and maintenance expenses 
the mpuc issued an interim order in april allowing miso day charges to be recovered through the nsp minnesota fuel clause adjustment fca mechanism 
in december  the mpuc issued a second interim order approving the recovery of certain miso charges through the fca mechanism but requiring that additional charges either be recovered as part of a general rate case or through an annual review process outside the fca mechanism  and requiring refunds of non fca costs 
however  the december mpuc order also suspended the refund obligation until such time as it could reconsider the matter 
on feb 
  the mpuc voted to reconsider its december order 
the mpuc on reconsideration determined that parties be directed to determine which charges are appropriately in the fca and which are more appropriately established in base rates and report back to the mpuc in days  to grant deferred accounting treatment for costs ultimately determined to be included in base rates for a period of months  with recovery of deferred amounts to be reviewed in a general rate case  and that amounts collected to date through the fca under the april and december interim orders are not subject to refund 
as a result  nsp minnesota will be allowed to recover its prudently incurred miso costs either through existing fuel clause mechanisms or in base rates 
in march  the pscw issued an interim order allowing nsp wisconsin deferred accounting treatment of miso charges 
however  the pscw staff issued an interpretive memorandum in october asserting that certain miso costs may not be recovered through the interim fuel cost mechanism and may not be deferrable 
nsp wisconsin and the other wisconsin utilities contested the pscw s interpretation in their november comments to the pscw 
to date  nsp wisconsin has deferred approximately million of miso day costs as a regulatory asset 
xcel energy has notified miso that nsp minnesota and nsp wisconsin may seek to withdraw from miso if rate recovery of day costs is not allowed 
withdrawal would require ferc approval and could require xcel energy to pay a withdrawal fee 
in addition  pursuant to ferc orders  nsp minnesota and nsp wisconsin are billed for certain miso day charges associated with the loads of certain wholesale transmission service customers taking service under pre miso grandfathered agreements gfas 
in march  xcel energy filed for the ferc s approval to pass through these charges to gfa customers 
ferc accepted the filing subject to refund and hearing procedures 
in  nsp minnesota and nsp wisconsin were billed for million of miso charges  which have not yet been recovered from gfa customers 
the likelihood of full rate recovery is uncertain at this time 
in addition  xcel energy has filed an appeal of the ferc orders 
capital expenditure regulation xcel energy s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants  and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy distribution system 
in addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments  in the cpuc and mpuc approved proposals to recover  through a rate surcharge  certain costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions in the denver and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
these rate recovery mechanisms are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis 
future cost recovery regulated public utilities are allowed to record as regulatory assets certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers in future periods  and to record as regulatory liabilities certain income items that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
in contrast  nonregulated enterprises would expense these costs and recognize the income in the current period 
if restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  xcel energy may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment  and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet 
such changes could have a material effect on xcel energy s results of operations in the period the write off is recorded 
at dec 
  xcel energy reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately million and regulatory liabilities of approximately billion that would be recognized in the statement of operations in the absence of regulation 
in addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities  restructuring and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory deferrals 
pending and recently concluded regulatory proceedings nsp minnesota electric rate case in november  nsp minnesota requested an electric rate increase of million or percent 
this increase was based on a requested percent return on common equity  a projected common equity ratio to total capitalization of percent and a projected electric rate base of billion 
on dec 
  the mpuc authorized an interim rate increase of million  subject to refund  which became effective on jan 
 the anticipated procedural schedule is as follows march nd intervenor direct testimony march th rebuttal testimony april th surrebuttal testimony april th april th evidentiary hearings may th initial briefs june th reply briefs july th administrative law judge report september th mpuc order nsp wisconsin general rate case in  nsp wisconsin  requested an electric revenue increase of million and a natural gas revenue increase of million  based on a test year  an percent return on equity and a common equity ratio of percent 
on jan 
  the pscw approved an electric revenue increase of million and a natural gas revenue increase of million  based on an percent return on equity and a percent common equity ratio target 
the new rates were effective jan 
 the order authorized the deferral of an additional million in costs related to nuclear decommissioning and manufactured gas plant site clean up for recovery in the next rate case 
the order also prohibits nsp wisconsin from paying dividends above million  if its actual calendar year average common equity ratio is or will fall below percent 
it also imposes an asymmetrical electric fuel clause bandwidth of positive percent to negative percent outside of which nsp wisconsin would be permitted to request or be required to change rates 
psco natural gas rate case in  psco filed for an increase of million in natural gas base rates in colorado  based on a return on equity of percent with a common equity ratio of percent 
on jan 
  the cpuc approved a settlement agreement between psco and other parties to the case 
final rates became effective feb 
 the terms of the settlement include natural gas revenue increase of million  return on common equity of percent  earnings over percent return on common equity will be refunded back to customers  common equity ratio of percent  and customer charges for the residential and commercial sales classes of and per month  respectively 
tax matters interest expense deductibility psco s wholly owned subsidiary  psr investments  inc psri  owns and manages permanent life insurance policies  known as coli policies  on some of psco s employees 
at various times  borrowings have been made against the cash values of these coli policies and deductions taken on the interest expense on these borrowings 
the irs has challenged the deductibility of such interest expense deductions and has disallowed the deductions taken in tax years through should the irs ultimately prevail on this issue  tax and interest payable through dec 
  would reduce earnings by an estimated million 
in  xcel energy received formal notification that the irs will seek penalties 
if penalties plus associated interest are also included  the total exposure through dec 
  is approximately million 
xcel energy estimates its annual earnings for would be reduced by million  after tax  which represents cents per share  if coli interest expense deductions were no longer available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
coli dow chemical court decision on jan 
  the th circuit of the us court of appeals issued an opinion in a federal income tax case involving the interest deductions for a coli program at dow chemical company 
the th circuit denied the tax deductions and reversed the decision of the trial court in the case 
xcel energy has analyzed the impact of the dow decision on its pending coli litigation and concluded there are significant factual differences between its case and the dow case 
the court s opinion in the dow case outlined three indicators of potential economic benefits to be examined in a coli case and noted that the outcome of coli cases is very fact determinative 
these indicators are positive pre deduction cash flows  mortality gains  and the buildup of cash values 
in a split decision  the th circuit found that the dow coli plans possessed none of these indicators of economic substance 
however  in xcel energy s coli case  the plans were projected to have sizeable pre deduction cash flows  based upon the relevant assumptions when purchased 
moreover  the plans presented the opportunity for mortality gains that were not eliminated either retroactively or prospectively 
xcel energy s coli plans had no provision for giving back any mortality gains that it might realize 
in addition  xcel energy s plans had large cash value increases that were not encumbered by loans during the first seven years of the policies 
consequently  xcel energy believes that the facts and circumstances of its case are stronger than dow s case and continues to believe its case has strong merits 
environmental matters environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning  storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel  disposal of hazardous materials and waste  remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges to the environment 
a trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation has caused  and may continue to cause  higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
in addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses  costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately million in  million in  and million in xcel energy expects to expense an average of approximately million per year from through for similar costs 
however  the precise timing and amount of environmental costs  including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials  are currently unknown 
additionally  the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates is not certain 
capital expenditures placed in service on environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately million in  million in  and million in the regulated utilities expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations and environmental improvements in  and approximately million of related expenditures during the period from through included in these amounts are expenditures to reduce emissions of generating plants in minnesota and colorado 
approximately million and million of these expenditures  respectively  are related to modifications to reduce the emissions of nsp minnesota s generating plants located in the minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan area pursuant to the merp  which are recoverable from customers through cost recovery mechanisms 
expected expenditures related to environmental modifications on comanche units and are approximately million in and million during the period from through the remaining expected capital expenditures relate to various other environmental projects 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of xcel energy s environmental contingencies 
the issue of global climate change is receiving increased attention 
debate continues concerning the extent to which the earth s climate is warming  the causes of climate variations that have been observed and the ultimate impact that might result from a changing climate 
there also is considerable debate regarding public policy for the approach that the united states should follow to address the issue 
the united nations sponsored kyoto protocol  which establishes greenhouse gas reduction targets for developed nations  entered into force on feb 
 president bush has declared that the united states will not ratify the protocol and is opposed to legislative mandates  preferring a program based on voluntary efforts and research on new technologies 
xcel energy is closely monitoring the issue from both scientific and policy perspectives 
while it is not possible to know the eventual outcome  xcel energy believes the issue merits close attention and is taking actions it believes are prudent to be best positioned for a variety of possible outcomes 
xcel energy is participating in a voluntary carbon management program and has established goals to reduce its volume of carbon dioxide emissions by million tons by  and to reduce carbon intensity by percent by in certain regulatory jurisdictions  the evaluation process for future generating resources incorporates the risk of future carbon limits through the use of a carbon cost adder or externality costs 
xcel energy also is involved in other projects to improve available methods for managing carbon 
impact of nonregulated investments in the past  xcel energy s investments in nonregulated operations have had a significant impact on its results of operations 
as a result of the divestiture of nrg and other nonregulated operations  xcel energy does not expect that its investments in nonregulated operations will continue to have such a significant impact on its results 
xcel energy does not expect to make any material investments in nonregulated projects 
inflation inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect xcel energy s prices or returns to shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
the application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events  including the likelihood of success of particular projects  legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs 
these judgments  in and of themselves  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions  which may be appropriate to use 
in addition  the financial and operating environment also may have a significant effect  not only on the operation of the business  but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed 
the following is a list of accounting policies that are most significant to the portrayal of xcel energy s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the audit committee of the xcel energy board of directors

for example probable outcomes of regulatory proceedings are assessed in cases of requested cost recovery or other approvals from regulators 
the ability to operate plant facilities and recover the related costs over their useful operating lives  or such other period designated by xcel energy s regulators  is assumed 
probable outcomes of reviews and challenges raised by tax authorities  including appeals and litigation where necessary  are assessed 
projections are made regarding earnings on pension investments  and the salary increases provided to employees over their periods of service 
future cash inflows of operations are projected in order to assess whether they will be sufficient to recover future cash outflows  including the impact of product price changes and market penetration to customer groups 
the information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of xcel energy  or otherwise change over time 
this may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available 
the accompanying financial statements reflect management s best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of dec 
 recently implemented accounting changes for a discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting changes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r related to equity based compensation 
this statement replaces the original sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  companies are no longer allowed to account for their share based payment awards using the intrinsic value allowed by previous accounting requirements  which did not require any expense to be recorded on stock options granted with an equal to or greater than fair market value exercise price 
instead  equity based compensation arrangements will be measured and recognized based on the grant date fair value using an option pricing model such as black scholes or binomial that considers at least six factors identified in sfas no 
r 
an expense related to the difference between the grant date fair value and the purchase price would be recognized over the vesting period of the options 
under previous guidance  companies were allowed to initially estimate forfeitures or recognize them as they actually occurred 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant and to adjust that estimate when information becomes available that suggests actual forfeitures will differ from previous estimates 
revisions to forfeiture estimates will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the revision occurs 
previous accounting guidance allowed for compensation expense related to performance share plans to be reversed if the target was not met 
however  under sfas no 
r  compensation expense for performance share plans that expire unexercised due to the company s failure to reach a certain target stock price cannot be reversed 
any accruals made for xcel energy s restricted stock unit plan that were granted in and based on a total shareholder return could not be reversed if the target was not met 
implementation of sfas no 
r is required for annual periods beginning after june  xcel energy is required to adopt the provisions in the first quarter of implementation is not expected to have a material impact on net income or earnings per share 
accounting for uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb discussed potential changes or clarifications in the criteria for recognition of income tax benefits  which may result in raising the threshold for recognizing tax benefits that have some degree of uncertainty 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft on accounting for uncertain tax positions under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
as issued  the exposure draft would have been effective dec 
  and only tax benefits that meet the probable recognition threshold would be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date 
initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent to the comment period that closed in september  the fasb announced that the effective date of its new interpretation will be delayed  with a revised pronouncement to be released no earlier than the first quarter of in redeliberations in november  the fasb decided that the benefit recognition approach in the exposure draft should be retained  but that the initial recognition threshold should be more likely than not rather than probable 
in redeliberations on jan 
  the fasb addressed the issues of transition and effective date 
for xcel energy  the new interpretation  if and when issued  is likely to be effective beginning jan 
  with any cumulative effect of the change reflected in retained earnings 
although xcel energy has not assessed the impact of a new recognition threshold on all of its open tax positions  based on available information  it believes that its coli tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  and therefore it plans to continue to recognize all coli tax benefits in full 
see factors affecting results of continuing operations tax matters for further discussion of this matter 
derivatives  risk management and market risk in the normal course of business  xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks 
market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
all financial and commodity related instruments  including derivatives  are subject to market risk 
these risks  as applicable to xcel energy and its subsidiaries  are discussed in further detail later 
commodity price risk xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations 
commodity price risk is managed by entering into both long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity  energy and energy related products  and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities 
commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments 
xcel energy s risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists 
short term wholesale and commodity trading risk xcel energy s subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities  including the purchase and sale of capacity  energy and energy related instruments 
these marketing activities are primarily focused on specific regions where market knowledge and experience have been obtained and are generally less than one year in length 
xcel energy s risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within approved guidelines and limitations as approved by the company s risk management committee  which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by the policy 
certain contracts and financial instruments within the scope of these activities qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

the fair value of the commodity trading contracts as of dec 
  was as follows millions of dollars fair value of trading contracts outstanding at jan 
 contracts realized or settled during the year fair value of trading contract additions and changes during the year fair value of contracts outstanding at dec 
 as of dec 
  the fair values by source for the commodity trading and hedging net asset or liability balances were as follows commodity trading contracts futures forwards thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total futures forwards fair value nsp minnesota psco total futures forwards fair value options thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total options fair value nsp minnesota psco total options fair value hedge contracts futures forwards thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total futures forwards fair value nsp minnesota psco total futures forwards fair value options thousands of dollars source of fair value maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity greater than years total options fair value nsp minnesota nsp wisconsin psco total options fair value prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices 
prices based on models and other valuation methods 
these represent the fair value of positions calculated using internal models when directly and indirectly quoted external prices or prices derived from external sources are not available 
internal models incorporate the use of options pricing and estimates of the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms 
the models reflect management s estimates  taking into account observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlations of commodity prices and contractual volumes 
market price uncertainty and other risks also are factored into the model 
normal purchases and sales transactions  as defined by sfas no 
and certain other long term power purchase contracts are not included in the fair values by source tables as they are not included in the commodity trading operations and are not qualifying hedges 
at dec 
  a percent increase in market prices over the next months for commodity trading contracts would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million  whereas a percent decrease would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million 
xcel energy s short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions  contracts and obligations that have been entered into  but not closed  using an industry standard methodology known as value at risk var 
var expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions  contracts and obligations over a particular period of time  with a given confidence interval under normal market conditions 
xcel energy utilizes the variance covariance approach in calculating var 
the var model employs a percent confidence interval level based on historical price movement  lognormal price distribution assumption  delta half gamma approach for non linear instruments and a three day holding period for both electricity and natural gas 
as of dec 
  the vars for the commodity trading operations were during millions of dollars year ended dec 
 average high low commodity trading a a comprises transactions for nsp minnesota  psco and sps

interest rate risk xcel energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
xcel energy s policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps  caps  collars and put or call options 
xcel energy engages in hedges of cash flow and fair value exposure 
the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is initially recorded in other comprehensive income 
reclassification of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of variable rate debt instruments from other comprehensive income into earnings occurs as interest payments are accrued on the debt instrument  and generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying variable rate debt 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset  liability or firm commitment 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair values of related hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments 
to test the effectiveness of such swaps  a hypothetical swap is used to mirror all the critical terms of the underlying debt and regression analysis is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through counterparty valuations  internal valuations and broker quotes 
there have been no material changes in the techniques or models used in the valuation of interest rate swaps during the periods presented 
at dec 
 and  a basis point change in the benchmark rate on xcel energy s variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of xcel energy and its subsidiaries interest rate swaps 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries also maintain trust funds  as required by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  to fund certain costs of nuclear decommissioning  which are subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk 
as of dec 
 and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities and fixed rate fixed income securities 
per nrc mandates  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates  therefore fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings 
credit risk in addition to the risks discussed previously  xcel energy and its subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations 
xcel energy and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties 
xcel energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees  standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures 
the credit exposure is monitored and  when necessary  the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided 
at dec 
  a percent increase in prices would have resulted in a net mark to market increase in credit risk exposure of million  while a decrease of percent would have resulted in a decrease of million

capital requirements utility capital expenditures  nonregulated investments and long term debt obligations the estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of xcel energy and its subsidiaries  excluding discontinued operations  and other capital requirements for the years  and are shown in the table below 
millions of dollars electric utility natural gas utility common utility total utility other nonregulated total capital expenditures debt maturities total capital requirements the capital expenditure forecast includes psco s share of the megawatt comanche coal fired plant in colorado and the merp project  which will reduce the emissions of three of nsp minnesota s generating plants 
the merp project is expected to cost approximately billion  with major construction starting in and finishing in xcel energy began recovering the costs of the emission reduction project through customer rate increases effective jan 
 comanche is expected to cost approximately billion  with major construction starting in and finishing in the cpuc has approved sharing one third ownership of this plant with other parties 
consequently  xcel energy s capital expenditure forecast includes billion  approximately two thirds of the total cost 
the capital expenditure programs of xcel energy are subject to continuing review and modification 
actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth  the desired reserve margin and the availability of purchased power  as well as alternative plans for meeting xcel energy s long term energy needs 
in addition  xcel energy s ongoing evaluation of restructuring requirements  compliance with future requirements to install emission control equipment  and merger  acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies may impact actual capital requirements 
contractual obligations and other commitments xcel energy has contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that will need to be funded in the future  in addition to its capital expenditure programs 
the following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at dec 
 see additional discussion in the consolidated statements of capitalization and notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period thousands of dollars total less than year to years to years after years long term debt  principal and interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases a unconditional purchase obligations b other long term obligations payments to vendors in process short term debt total contractual cash obligations c a under some leases  xcel energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date 
most of xcel energy s railcar  vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms 
at dec 
  the amount that xcel energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately million 
b obligations to purchase fuels for electric generation plants  and electricity and natural gas for resale 
certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted based on indexes 
however  the effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms 
c xcel energy also has outstanding authority under contracts and blanket purchase orders to purchase up to approximately million of goods and services through the year  in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table and in the forecasted capital expenditures 
common stock dividends future dividend levels will be dependent on xcel energy s results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by the xcel energy board of directors 
xcel energy s objective is to deliver the financial results that will enable the board of directors to grant annual dividend increases in the range of percent to percent per year 
xcel energy s dividend policy balances projected cash generation from utility operations  projected capital investment in the utility businesses  a reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment  and the impact on xcel energy s capital structure and credit ratings 
in addition  there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels 
under the puhca  unless there was an order from the sec  a holding company or any subsidiary could only declare and pay dividends out of retained earnings 
xcel energy had million of retained earnings at dec 
  and expects to declare dividends as scheduled 
with the repeal of the puhca  this limitation on a holding company s dividends will no longer apply 
notwithstanding the repeal of the puhca  federal law will still limit the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends 
specifically  under the federal power act  a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account 
the cash to pay dividends to xcel energy shareholders is primarily derived from dividends received from the utility subsidiaries 
the utility subsidiaries are generally limited in the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory commissions to be paid to the holding company 
the limitation is imposed through equity ratio limitations that range from percent to percent 
some utility subsidiaries must comply with bond indenture covenants or restrictions under credit agreements for debt to total capitalization ratios 
the articles of incorporation of xcel energy place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding 
under the provisions  dividend payments may be restricted if xcel energy s capitalization ratio on a holding company basis only  ie  not on a consolidated basis is less than percent 
for these purposes  the capitalization ratio is equal to common stock plus surplus  divided by the sum of common stock plus surplus plus long term debt 
based on this definition  xcel energy s capitalization ratio at dec 
  was percent 
therefore  the restrictions do not place any effective limit on xcel energy s ability to pay dividends because the restrictions are only triggered when the capitalization ratio is less than percent or will be reduced to less than percent through dividends other than dividends payable in common stock  distributions or acquisitions of xcel energy common stock 
capital sources xcel energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt  long term debt  common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
registered holding companies and certain of their subsidiaries  including xcel energy and its utility subsidiaries  were limited under puhca in their ability to issue securities 
registered holding companies and their subsidiaries could not issue securities unless authorized by an exemptive rule or order of the sec 
because xcel energy did not qualify for any of the main exemptive rules  it had received financing authority from the sec under the puhca for various financing arrangements 
xcel energy s current financing authority permits it  subject to certain conditions  to issue through june   up to billion of new long term debt  common equity and equity linked securities  and billion of short term debt securities during the new authorization period  provided that the aggregate amount of long term debt  common equity  and equity linked and short term debt securities issued during the new authorization period does not exceed billion 
xcel energy s ability to issue securities under the financing authority was subject to a number of conditions 
one of the conditions of the financing authority was that xcel energy s consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization be at least percent 
as of dec 
  the common equity ratio was approximately percent 
additional conditions require that a security to be issued  must be at least rated investment grade by one nationally recognized rating agency 
finally  all outstanding securities that are rated must be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
on feb 
  xcel energy s senior unsecured debt was considered investment grade by standard poor s ratings services standard poor s  moody s and fitch ratings fitch 
upon the repeal of the puhca  these limitations on xcel energy s financings generally will no longer apply  nor will the puhca restrictions generally apply to the financings by the utility subsidiaries 
however  utility financings and intra system financing will become subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the federal power act 
the ferc has granted a blanket authorization for certain intra system financings involving holding companies 
requests to the ferc to clarify its rules or grant similar blanket authorizations are presently pending before the ferc 
xcel energy and the utility subsidiaries are presently evaluating the specific applications that they will need to file with ferc due to repeal of the puhca 
it is possible that in lieu of requesting authority from the ferc for intra system financings  xcel energy and the utility subsidiaries may rely in the interim on a transitional savings clause that would permit such financing transactions to the extent authorized by the sec financing order and so long as the conditions in the sec financing order continue to be satisfied 
short term funding sources historically  xcel energy has used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  including operating cash flow  notes payable  commercial paper and bank lines of credit 
the amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures and working capital 
another significant short term funding need is the dividend payment 
as of feb 
  xcel energy and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs facility drawn available cash liquidity maturity millions of dollars nsp minnesota april nsp wisconsin psco april psco april sps april xcel energy holding company november total includes direct borrowings  outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit 
operating cash flow as a source of short term funding is affected by such operating factors as weather  regulatory requirements  including rate recovery of costs  environmental regulation compliance and industry deregulation  changes in the trends for energy prices  and supply and operational uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
see further discussion of such factors under statement of operations analysis 
short term borrowing as a source of funding is affected by regulatory actions and access to reasonably priced capital markets 
for additional information on xcel energy s short term borrowing arrangements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
access to reasonably priced capital markets is dependent in part on credit agency reviews and ratings 
the following ratings reflect the views of moody s  standard poor s  and fitch 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency 
as of feb 
  the following represents the credit ratings assigned to various xcel energy companies company credit type moody s standard poor s fitch xcel energy senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb xcel energy commercial paper p a f nsp minnesota senior unsecured debt a bbb a nsp minnesota senior secured debt a a a nsp minnesota commercial paper p a f nsp wisconsin senior unsecured debt a bbb a nsp wisconsin senior secured debt a a a psco senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb psco senior secured debt a a a psco commercial paper p a f sps senior unsecured debt baa bbb a sps commercial paper p a f note moody s highest credit rating for debt is aaa and lowest investment grade rating is baa both standard poor s and fitch s highest credit rating for debt are aaa and lowest investment grade rating is bbb 
moody s prime ratings for commercial paper range from p to p standard poor s ratings for commercial paper range from a to a fitch s ratings for commercial paper range from f to f in the event of a downgrade of its credit ratings to below investment grade  xcel energy may be required to provide credit enhancements in the form of cash collateral  letters of credit or other security to satisfy all or a part of its exposures under guarantees outstanding 
see a list of guarantees at note to the consolidated financial statements 
xcel energy has no explicit rating triggers in its debt agreements 
money pool xcel energy has established a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries and received required state regulatory approvals 
the utility money pool allows for short term loans between the utility subsidiaries and from the holding company to the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates 
the utility money pool arrangement does not allow loans from the utility subsidiaries to the holding company 
nsp minnesota  psco and sps participate in the utility money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions 
no borrowings or loans were outstanding at dec 
 borrowing limits are million  million and million  respectively 
as a consequence of the repeal of puhca and the recent amendments to section of the federal power act  it may be necessary for xcel energy and the utility subsidiaries to submit its existing money pool arrangement to ferc for its approval 
xcel energy and the utility subsidiaries are presently evaluating the situation 
registration statements xcel energy s articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of billion shares of common stock 
as of dec 
  xcel energy had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  xcel energy s articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of million shares of par value preferred stock

psco has an effective shelf registration statement with the sec under which million of secured first collateral trust bonds or unsecured senior debt securities were registered 
psco has approximately million remaining under this registration 
future financing plans xcel energy generally expects to fund its operations and capital investments primarily through internally generated funds 
xcel energy plans to refinance existing long term debt or scheduled long term debt maturities at each of the regulated operating utilities based on prevailing market conditions 
to facilitate potential long term debt issuances at the utility subsidiaries  sps intends to file a long term debt shelf registration statement with the sec for up to million in  and nsp wisconsin may file a long term debt shelf registration for up to million 
off balance sheet arrangements xcel energy does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors
