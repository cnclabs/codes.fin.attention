general we are in the business of marketing and distributing safety and security products which are primarily manufactured through our owned hong kong joint venture

a discussion and analysis of the hong kong joint venture s operational results for these periods is presented below under the heading hong kong joint venture 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended march   and sales 
in fiscal year  our net sales increased by   from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our focus on marketing to the electrical distribution trade through our usi electric subsidiary accounted for approximately  of the increased sales  principally due to increased volume from approximately  in to approximately  in 
the company also increased its sales to retail and wholesale customers in the fiscal year ended march  we anticipate continued revenue growth in all of our markets 
in fiscal year  sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increased sales of gfci units and our focus on marketing to retailers  including the wholesale distribution trade  generated the majority of the increase 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in the fiscal year ended march  reflects variations in the mix of products sold and is a function of higher sales  since certain fixed costs do not increase at the same rate as sales 
the decrease in gross margin for the year ended march  when compared to resulted from higher costs and pricing concessions applied to meet competitive pressures 
expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales is attributable to costs that do not increase proportionately with the higher sales volume and a reduction in legal expenses from the period 
our legal expenses decreased by  in to  from  in fiscal the reduction in legal expense was partially offset by an increase of  in commissions and freight charges  the account classification which was the most significant factor in this dollar increase  due to our higher sales volume 
commissions and freight charges  as a percentage of sales  while consistent with commissions and freight charges of the prior year  vary directly with sales volume 
currently  we are a non accelerated filer and the company is not required to comply with the registered public accounting firm attestation provisions of section a of the sarbanes oxley act of it is anticipated the company will be required to comply with these provisions for the fiscal year commencing april  the company expects to incur initial and ongoing costs that  at present  cannot be quantified in complying with the provisions of section a of sarbanes oxley 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales is attributable to costs that do not increase proportionately with the higher sales volume 
various expense categories contributed to the increased dollar amount of the expense  but the following major account classifications were significant factors in this dollar increase i commissions and freight charges  as a percentage of sales  while consistent with commissions and freight charges of the prior year  vary directly with sales volume 
therefore  of the  increase in expenses   is attributable to commissions and freight charges from higher sales volume during the period

professional fees associated with the patent litigation decreased by approximately  to approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  professional fees associated with patent litigation for the period were reduced by insurance reimbursements 
interest income and expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to decreased borrowing 
interest expense for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal primarily due to higher interest rates 
the majority of the company s cash balances are maintained on deposit with the factor and earn interest at the factor s prime rate of interest minus 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company earned  on these deposits 
income taxes 
during the fiscal year ended  the company offset  of taxable income by utilizing the remainder of its net operating loss carryforward deduction 
in addition  the company offset federal taxes of approximately  with foreign tax credits available as a result of foreign taxes paid on the repatriated earnings of the hong kong joint venture 
at march   the company has no remaining net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future us federal taxable income  and the valuation allowance previously established to offset tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets was fully utilized 
we did not make a provision for federal income taxes in each of the and fiscal years  due to our operating loss carryforward for income tax purposes 
however  we made a provision of  and  for state income taxes for fiscal year and  respectively 
net income 
we reported net income of  for fiscal year compared to a net income of  for fiscal year  a  increase 
this increase in net income resulted from increased sales volume and higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above  and the income tax benefits provided by the use of net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and arising from the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
we reported net income of  for fiscal year compared to a net income of  for fiscal year  a  increase 
this increase in net income resulted from both higher hong kong joint venture earnings and higher gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses as described above 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are currently met by funds generated from operations and from our factoring agreement  which supplies both short term borrowings and letters of credit to finance foreign inventory purchases 
the maximum we may borrow under this agreement is  accordingly  based on specified percentages of our accounts receivable and inventory and letter of credit commitments  at march   our maximum borrowing availability under this agreement is  any outstanding principal balance under this agreement is payable upon demand 
the interest rate on the factoring agreement  on the uncollected factored accounts receivable and any additional borrowings is equal to the prime rate of interest charged by the factor which  as of march   was 
any borrowings are collateralized by all our accounts receivable and inventory

contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents  as of march   our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in note e to the consolidated financial statements 
payment due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations    critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statement included as part of this document 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application on these and other accounting policies see note a to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from these estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements issued by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon historical experience 
inventories are valued at the lower of market or cost 
cost is determined on the first in first out method 
we have recorded a reserve for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management reviews the reserve quarterly 
we currently have a foreign tax credit carryforward and deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we had previously provided a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets associated with the future tax benefits such as foreign tax credits  foreign net operating losses  capital losses and net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses and losses in recent years 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
as a result of management s assessment  the allowance previously provided to offset tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets at march  has been reduced to zero 
we are subject to lawsuits and other claims  related to patents and other matters 
management is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards statement revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in operating results based on their fair values 
statement r will be effective for the company on april   the beginning of the company s fiscal statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to use the modified prospective method to adopt the provisions of statement r 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s operating results 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the company believes the impact would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions has not been significant 
in may  the fasb issued statement  accounting for changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application a term defined by the statement to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
in addition  statement redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt statement beginning april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal financial instrument is our factoring agreement which provides for interest at the factor s prime rate at march  
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by us under our factoring agreement 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  at march  and during the fiscal year then ended  we had no material principal amount outstanding under the facility 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
