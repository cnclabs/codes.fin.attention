item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the computer  telecommunications  industrial and networking markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
in the company returned to profitability after recording a loss on an annual basis for the first time in its history in the first half of was characterized by limited visibility into  and uncertainty of  customer demand 
the uncertainty of demand was compounded in the first half of by events such as the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in asia sars 
the company s quarterly revenues remained relatively flat  averaging million per quarter for the first half of in the second half of  customer demand increased as the united states and asian economies began to grow more rapidly 
the company s new order rates  or bookings  grew faster than revenue in the third and fourth quarter of  resulting in sequential growth in both revenues and order backlog 
the growth in new orders and revenues in the second half of was driven by demand for the company s standard products from customers serving the communications  computing  industrial and wireless handset end markets 
the company also focused on reducing costs  including manufacturing costs and aligning its cost structure with revenue levels while retaining manufacturing capability and sustaining a level of research and development to support the company s future growth 
gross margins and net income increased in the second half of as the company s manufacturing cost reduction actions  such as the closure of the santa clara wafer fabrication facility  began to be realized 
the company continued to generate positive cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis throughout the company s financial results continued to improve in the company s revenues grew to the highest level since  increasing percent over the increase in customer demand in the first half of caused lead times for semiconductor components  including micrel s  to expand as customers and distributors became concerned about availability of supply 
the company s revenues continued to grow in the first half of the year and gross margin  operating margin and net income increased on a sequential basis in both the first and second quarters 
by the end of the second quarter  customers began to perceive that the supply of semiconductor components was generally sufficient and lead times for certain components began to shrink 
in the third and fourth quarter of  demand was below normal seasonal levels as customers reacted quickly to uncertain demand for their products  decreasing semiconductor lead times and uncertain economic conditions by reducing their order rates 
customers in certain end markets such as networking  enterprise computing and high speed communications experienced lower demand for their end products than they had anticipated 
this factor  combined with rapidly shrinking lead times from most semiconductor suppliers  led to lower order rates for the company s products in the second half of as customers attempted to control their inventory levels 
the company s level of on hand inventory remained above prior year levels to provide a high level of customer service in response to shorter customer lead times 
as a result of lower order rates  the company s backlog and revenues declined in both the third and fourth quarter of despite the decline in customer demand and revenue in the second half of  the company s continued focus on manufacturing cost reductions resulted in an eight percentage point increase in gross margin from in to in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in the first quarter of  demand as measured by order rates  improved substantially over fourth quarter of levels 
first quarter bookings increased by over fourth quarter levels 
the improvement in order rates was driven by customers serving the industrial  computing and communications end markets 
bookings from micrel s major distributors increased in the first quarter after falling sharply in the second half of as distributors adjusted to shorter industry lead times and reduced their inventory levels 
despite increased bookings during the first quarter and lean supply chain inventory levels  order lead times from micrel s customers continued to average two to three weeks 
first quarter gross margin improved to  percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of and more than percentage points above the year ago period on approximately the same level of revenues 
operating profit and net income in the first quarter of also increased from both the first and fourth quarters of in the second quarter of  the ongoing short lead time environment continued to cause customers to order only what was required for their short term needs 
second quarter order rates declined from first quarter levels primarily due to lower order amounts from the company s distributors and certain customers serving the wireless handset end market 
bookings from the company s major sell through distributors declined from strong first quarter levels and were less than overall resales for the second quarter as distributors attempted to increase their inventory turns to improve their return on working capital 
inventories at the company s asia based stocking representatives also declined sequentially in the second quarter 
in the wireless handset market  customers reduced both orders and production levels in coordination with efforts to reduce channel inventories of handsets 
second quarter revenues increased sequentially by but were less than the revenues of the year ago period 
the company continued to exercise pricing discipline for most of its products in an attempt to improve gross profit 
consequently  sales of certain products  such as those serving the soho ethernet market and the low end personal computer market  declined resulting in a lower rate of revenue growth for the company 
gross margin continued to improve in the second quarter  increasing to from in the year ago period and in the first quarter of the increase in gross margin was primarily due to better pricing discipline  improved sales mix of higher margin products  ongoing manufacturing cost reductions and lower depreciation expense as a result of disciplined capital spending 
third quarter order rates increased substantially from second quarter levels  increasing sequentially in all geographic regions 
throughout the third quarter customers continued to place orders with short delivery requirements  even as the aggregate order level increased 
order levels from the company s distributors increased in the third quarter  returning to a level consistent with sales of micrel s products to their end customers 
third quarter revenues increased sequentially by but were below the revenue level of the year ago period 
although order rates were strong  third quarter revenue growth was impacted by product shortages for ethernet products due to longer manufacturing cycle times at third party wafer suppliers and reduced demand for certain commodity products possibly as a result of continued pricing discipline 
gross margin improved further in the third quarter  increasing to from in the year ago period and in the second quarter 
the increase in gross margin was primarily a result of ongoing manufacturing cost reductions and an improved sales mix of higher margin products 
continued broad based demand  combined with lean channel inventories and short lead times  resulted in higher order rates for the company in the fourth quarter of order strength in the quarter from customers serving the industrial and communications end markets  and from the company s major distributors  resulted in the second highest quarterly booking level since calendar year revenues increased on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter to million and were above the revenues in the year ago period 
gross margin increased by percentage points to from the third to the fourth quarter and was percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of primarily due to a higher mix of sales with higher gross margins  and increased factory utilization 
the fourth quarter gross management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued margin was the third highest quarterly gross margin in the company s history and has returned to levels recorded in the year this is notable since the revenues and capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of were approximately one third lower than comparable peak levels in despite an increase in legal expenses associated with an atypically high level of litigation activity  the company s operating income and operating margin increased on both a sequential and year over year basis in the fourth quarter 
although order rates increased in the fourth quarter  customer lead times remained short  averaging three to four weeks 
in  the company s commitment to improving gross margin resulted in the third consecutive year of gross margin expansion 
gross margin for the year increased to in  up percentage points from in the gross margin improvement in was a result of pricing discipline  a greater mix of higher gross margin products  ongoing manufacturing cost reduction efforts and disciplined capital spending which allowed for continued reduction in depreciation expense 
operating margin in the second half of was above the level in the second half of although revenues for the two periods were roughly the same 
the company continued to consistently generate positive cash flows throughout the company generated the third highest annual operating cash flow in the company s history during operating cash flow less cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment commonly referred to as free cash flow was also the third highest annual amount in the company s history 
in  micrel acquired bluechip communications as bluechip of oslo  norway 
bluechip is a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance rf ics and modules for the actuation and connectivity markets 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase under sfas business combinations and  accordingly  the results of operations of bluechip from the date of acquisition forward have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in item a 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors  primarily located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue recognition and related cost of sales are deferred  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and asian based stocking representatives are recognized upon shipment 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  state and federal research and development credit carryforwards and state manufacturers credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined 
during the second quarter of  the company reversed million of accrued income tax liabilities as a result of the completion of a federal income tax audit 
in addition  related to the federal tax audit completion  the company also reversed million in accrued payroll tax liabilities 
this reduction in accrued payroll tax liabilities was recorded as a million reduction in cost of revenues  a million reduction in research and development expense and a million reduction in selling  general and administrative expense in the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in such intellectual property litigation and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation manufacturing facility impairment restructuring expense acquisition expenses litigation accrual total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in due to decreased standard product revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these decreases resulted primarily from decreased unit shipments of standard products to the high speed communications and networking end markets 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for for the year ended december   net revenues increased to million from million in primarily due to increased standard product revenues  which were partially offset by decreased custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for these increases resulted primarily from increased unit shipments of standard products to the telecommunications  computer  industrial  high speed communications and networking end markets 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products principally due to the cessation of manufacturing for a single customer  lexmark  at the end of customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
the company averaged approximately to turns fill per quarter during throughout customers maintained a focus on inventory control  continuing the trend that began in the second half of overall semiconductor industry channel inventories remained near historical low levels throughout nevertheless  customers were cautious about committing new orders  relying instead on short lead times and the willingness of semiconductor manufacturers to hold inventory and react quickly to supply their short term needs 
as a result  order lead times from the company s customers stayed relatively short throughout when demand for the company s products increased in the third and fourth quarter  order backlog increased and lead times from the company s customers grew modestly to three to four weeks  from approximately two to three weeks in the first nine months of although higher backlog and slightly longer order lead times provide modestly improved visibility into end demand  the ongoing reliance on turns fill orders and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
the uncertainty in demand arising from these factors  together with the effects of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
in this environment the company  its stocking representatives and distributors may have to carry higher levels of inventory to service anticipated customer demand 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these decreases resulted primarily from decreased shipments of high speed communications products primarily in asia and to a lesser extent europe 
the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves except by price 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a greater sales mix of higher margin products combined with decreased depreciation  decreased wafer fabrication costs and decreased external assembly and test costs 
in addition  gross profit for the year ended december  includes the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities  recorded in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  from for the same period in for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from a greater sales mix of higher margin products  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued decreased wafer fabrication costs  and decreased external assembly and test costs 
during the year ended december   the company reduced sales of low margin foundry products and increased sales of higher margin analog and high speed communications standard products as compared to the same periods in in addition  during  the company benefited from decreased wafer fabrication costs resulting from the company s wafer fabrication consolidation effort see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and lower costs for external assembly and test manufacturing services 
the company s gross profit margin has also benefited from spreading fixed costs over a higher sales volume 
in addition  gross profit for the year ended december  includes the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities  recorded in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of sales declined to for the year ended december  from for the same period in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily due to increased prototype fabrication costs combined with increased staffing costs  which was partially offset by decreased depreciation costs 
in addition  included a benefit of million from the reversal of accrued payroll tax liabilities associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue significant investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the years ended december  and  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased prototype fabrication costs and the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was principally attributable to increased outside legal costs  primarily associated with litigation activity  combined with increased staffing costs 
in addition  included a benefit of million from the reversal of accrued payroll tax liabilities associated with the conclusion of a tax audit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was principally attributable to increased commissions related to higher revenues  increased staffing costs and profit sharing accruals  increased accounting and auditing fees associated with implementation of the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and increased outside legal costs which were partially offset by the reversal of million of accrued payroll tax liabilities in the second quarter of  associated with the conclusion of a tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
during the years through december  certain of the company s option pricing practices resulted in stock compensation expense under apb in addition  the company assumed certain stock options granted to employees of kendin communications in connection with the acquisition of kendin communications in which were compensatory under apb for the year ended december   total amortization of deferred stock compensation was  compared to million in this decrease resulted primarily from prior year additions becoming fully amortized 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards on the grant date 
the company was required to adopt sfas no 
r effective january  the company currently estimates that the adoption of sfas r will result in additional amortization of stock based compensation expense and a reduction of operating income for of approximately million to million 
however  the actual impact to net income of adopting sfas r in could differ from this estimate depending upon the number and timing of options granted during  as well as their vesting period and vesting criteria  and the tax effect on stock compensation expense due to the timing and quantity of incentive stock options exercised 
for more discussion of sfas no 
r see the caption new accounting standards included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchased in process technology 
in  micrel acquired of the outstanding common stock and options to purchase common stock of bluechip  in a cash for stock transaction 
micrel paid approximately million in cash and incurred approximately  in direct acquisition costs for the outstanding bluechip securities and options 
the fair value of the acquired assets exceeded the purchase price by million 
the company deferred million of this excess amount as potential contingent consideration of million was payable  under the terms of the agreement  if certain revenue and gross profit targets were met by the bluechip operations during calendar year as of december   it was determined that the additional contingent consideration of million  which was initially recorded in the first quarter of  would not be payable as certain revenue and gross profit targets were not achieved by the bluechip operation 
as a result  the additional contingent consideration was reversed in the fourth quarter of and the purchase cost allocation was adjusted accordingly see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the purchase cost allocation  as adjusted for the final determination of the contingent consideration  resulted in million of the purchase cost allocated to intangible assets 
of that amount   was expensed during the year ended december  to purchased in process technology  which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future 
the remaining intangible assets of million  consisting of million in existing technology and  in customer relationships  are included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of three to five years 
manufacturing facility impairment and restructuring expense 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  california wafer fabrication facility to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company accrued million in restructuring expenses associated with the facility closure which consisted of million for equipment disposal costs and million in net contractual building lease costs  excluding estimated sublease income  that will provide no future benefit 
during  the company ceased all manufacturing processes within the santa clara facility and completed the relocation of all employees to its san jose  ca facilities 
during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual and recorded an additional  in net restructuring accrual adjustments which were charged to restructuring expense in during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual 
the company also increased its accrued restructuring expenses for contractual building lease costs by  to eliminate remaining estimated future sub lease income as efforts to sub lease the facility had been unsuccessful and the estimated probability of future sub lease was reduced to less than probable 
during  the company paid million in restructuring costs that reduced the previous restructuring accrual 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual was million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and is classified as other current liabilities 
actual future costs may be different than these estimates and would require an adjustment to restructuring expense in the period such determination is made 
litigation accrual 
on july   a jury ruled against micrel in its suit against trw automotive and for trw automotive in its counter suit against micrel 
the suits were related to a contract dispute between the two companies 
as a result of the jury s verdict  micrel accrued million in litigation expense in the second quarter financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term and long term investment grade securities and money market funds and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average interest rate earned on investment of cash and short term investment balances 
for the year ended december  other income  net increased by million to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to increased interest income rate of returns on increased cash and investment balances and decreased interest expense resulting from a decrease in average debt as compared to the prior year 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of federal research and development credits  federal qualified production activities credits  state income taxes and state research and development credits 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes 
the income tax provision for is based on the company s estimated annual statutory tax rate of of pretax income  reduced by a million reversal of accrued income tax liabilities in the second quarter of  as a result of the completion of a federal income tax audit see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of federal export tax credits  state income taxes and state research and development credits 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december   consisted of cash and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank under which the company could borrow million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
associated with the acquisition of bluechip  the company has  outstanding in term notes payable to the norwegian industrial and regional development fund 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million combined with a million decrease in inventories  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in other accrued liabilities and a million increase in accrued compensation  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivables 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities of million were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million combined with a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors  which were partially offset by a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in other accrued liabilities and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
for the year ended december   the company used cash of million in investing activities comprised of million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  which was partially offset by net proceeds of  from the sale of short term investments 
for the year ended december   the company used cash of million in investing activities comprised of net million in net investment purchases  million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million used for the purchase of bluechip and for the purchase of intangible assets 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million used to repurchase  shares of common stock which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  of million was the result of million used to repurchase  shares of common stock combined with million in repayments of long term debt  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
the company currently intends to spend approximately million to million to purchase capital equipment and make facility improvements during the next twelve months primarily for manufacturing equipment for wafer fabrication and product testing and additional research and development related software and equipment 
the company is currently authorized by its board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its common stock through december  since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
the company believes that its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for in the longer term  the company believes future cash requirements will continue to be met by its cash from operations  and future debt or equity financings as required 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recently issued accounting standards please refer to the caption new accounting standards within note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting standards 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   the company had the following contractual obligations and commitments in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements operating leases see note of notes to consolidated financial statements     accrued litigation liability see note of notes to consolidated financial statements   open purchase orders   total     open purchase orders are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions  and the approximate timing of the transactions 
borrowing agreements consisted of a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on behalf of the company 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit at december  and there were  in standby letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credit are issued to guarantee payments for the company s workers compensation program 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements and has not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments 
short term investments consist primarily of liquid debt instruments and are classified as available for sale securities 
investments purchased with remaining maturity dates of greater than three months and less than months are classified as short term 
investments purchased with remaining maturity dates of months or greater are classified as long term 
the short term investments held at december  are primarily fixed rate securities 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company held an insignificant amount of fixed rate long term debt subject to interest rate risk
