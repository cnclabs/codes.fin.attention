item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results 
our md a is presented in sections management s overview critical accounting policies overview of fiscal year results results of operations liquidity and capital resources management s overview regis corporation rgs owns or franchises beauty salons  hair restoration centers and educational establishments 
as of june   our worldwide operations included  system wide north american and international salons  hair restoration centers and beauty schools 
each of our salon concepts offer generally similar products and services and serves mass market consumers 
our salon operations are organized to be managed based on geographical location 
our north american salon operations include  salons  including  franchise salons  operating in the united states  canada and puerto rico primarily under the trade names of regis salons  mastercuts  trade secret  smartstyle  supercuts and cost cutters 
our international salon operations include  salons  including  franchise salons  located throughout europe  primarily in the united kingdom  france  italy and spain 
in december  we purchased hair club for men and women 
this enterprise includes north american locations  including franchise locations 
our beauty schools are managed in aggregate  regardless of geographical location  and include locations in the united states and four locations in the united kingdom 
during fiscal year  we had approximately  corporate employees worldwide 
our growth strategy consists of two primary  but flexible  components 
through a combination of organic and acquisition growth  we seek to achieve our long term objective of eight to percent annual revenue growth 
we anticipate that going forward  the mix of organic and acquisition growth will be roughly equal 
however  depending on several factors  including the ability of our salon development program to keep pace with the availability of real estate for new construction  student enrollment  hair restoration lead generation  the availability of attractive acquisition candidates and same store sales trends  this mix will vary from year to year 
we believe achieving revenue growth of eight to percent  including same store sales increases in excess of two percent  will allow us to increase annual earnings at a low double digit growth rate 
we anticipate expanding our presence in both north america and europe 
additionally  we desire to enter the asian market within the next five years 
maintaining financial flexibility is a key element in continuing our successful growth 
with strong operating cash flow and balance sheet  we are confident that we will be able to financially support our long term growth objectives 
salon business the strength of our salon business is in the fundamental similarity and broad appeal of our salon concepts that allow flexibility and multiple salon concept placements in shopping centers and neighborhoods 
each concept generally targets the middle market customer  however  each attracts a different demographic 
we anticipate expanding all of our salon concepts 
in addition  we anticipate testing and developing new salon concepts to complement our existing concepts 
we execute our salon growth strategy by focusing on real estate 
our salon real estate strategy is to add new units in convenient locations with good visibility and customer traffic  as well as appropriate trade demographics 
our various salon and product concepts operate in a wide range of retailing environments  including regional shopping malls  strip centers and wal mart supercenters 
we believe that the availability of real estate will augment our ability to achieve the aforementioned long term growth objectives 
in fiscal  although we have tempered our outlook for constructed salons to between to units  we still expect to add between and net locations through a combination of organic  acquisition and franchise growth 
our long term outlook anticipates that we will add between to  net locations each year through a combination of organic  acquisition and franchise growth 
organic salon revenue growth is achieved through the combination of new salon construction and salon same store sales increases 
each fiscal year  we anticipate building several hundred company owned salons 
we anticipate our franchisees will open several hundred salons as well 
older  unprofitable salons will be closed or relocated 
our long term outlook for our salon business is for annual consolidated low single digit same store sales increases 
based on current fashion and economic cycles ie  longer hairstyles and lengthening of customer visitation patterns  we project our annual fiscal year consolidated same store sales increase to be one to two percent 
historically  our salon acquisitions have varied in size from as small as one salon to over one thousand salons 
the median acquisition size is approximately ten salons 
from fiscal year to fiscal year  we acquired  salons  net of franchise buybacks 
we anticipate adding several hundred company owned salons each year from acquisitions 
some of these acquisitions may include buying salons from our franchisees 
hair restoration business in december  we acquired hair club for men and women 
hair club for men and women is a provider of hair loss solutions with an estimated five percent share of the billion domestic market 
this industry is comprised of numerous locations domestically and is highly fragmented 
as a result  we believe there is an opportunity to consolidate this industry through acquisition 
expanding the hair loss business organically and through acquisition would allow us to add incremental revenue which is neither dependent upon  nor dilutive to  our existing salon and school businesses 
our organic growth plans for hair restoration include the construction of a modest number of new locations in untapped markets domestically and internationally 
however  the success of our hair restoration business is not dependent on the same real estate criteria used for salon expansion 
in an effort to provide confidentiality for our customers  hair restoration centers operate primarily in professional or medical office buildings 
further  the hair restoration business is more marketing intensive 
as a result  organic growth at our hair restoration centers will be dependent on successfully generating new leads and converting them into hair restoration customers 
our growth expectations for our hair restoration business are not dependent on referral business from  or cross marketing with  our hair salon business  but these concepts will be evaluated closely for additional growth opportunities 
beauty school business the beauty school business often participates in governmental programs designed to encourage education 
we believe there is an opportunity to place graduates in our various salon concepts which may provide us with another competitive advantage 
similar to the salon and hair loss industries  the beauty school industry is highly fragmented 
as a result  we believe there is an opportunity to consolidate this industry through acquisition 
capitalizing on these opportunities would allow us to add incremental revenue without cannibalizing our existing salon or hair restoration center businesses 
during fiscal year  we expect to moderate our acquisitions activity 
however  in the long term the company will continue to evaluate acquisition targets 
the success of a beauty school location is not dependent on good visibility or strong customer traffic  however  access to parking and or public transportation is important 
the success of existing and newly constructed schools is dependent on effective marketing and recruiting to attract new enrollees 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base these estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or at the time of a triggering event in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we consider our various concepts to be reporting units when testing for goodwill impairment because that is where we believe goodwill resides 
fair values are estimated based on our best estimate of the expected present value of future cash flows and compared with the corresponding carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates of revenues for the reporting units  driven by assumed organic growth rates  estimated future gross margin and expense rates  as well as acquisition integration and maturation  and appropriate discount and tax rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that are used to manage the underlying businesses 
charges for impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit may be incurred if the reporting unit fails to achieve its assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin  or if interest rates increase significantly 
consistent with prior years  during the third quarter of fiscal year  goodwill was tested for impairment in this manner 
the net book value of our european business approximated its fair value because we recorded a partial impairment during fiscal year  as described below 
in addition  the net book value of our beauty schools approximates fair value since a significant number of those schools were acquired during the past months 
the fair value of the north american salons and hair restoration centers exceeded their carrying amounts 
no impairment charges were recorded during fiscal year during the quarter ending march  our fiscal year  we reduced our expectations for the european business based on recent growth trends 
based on the results of our third quarter fiscal year goodwill impairment testing  which factored in these revised growth trend expectations  we wrote down the carrying value of the european business to reflect its estimated fair value 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax  non cash charge of million during fiscal year two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of fair value of goodwill for our european business are discount and tax rates 
in connection with the measurement we performed during fiscal year  a basis point increase in the discount rate we used would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million instead of million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
additionally  a five percent increase in the tax rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million instead of million  while a five percent decrease in the tax rate would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
our impairment analysis is performed on a salon by salon basis 
factors considered in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of an individual salon in relation to expectations  significant economic or geographic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the related total estimated future net cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
during fiscal years  and   and million of impairment was recorded within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
purchase price allocation we make numerous acquisitions 
the purchase prices are allocated to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
fair value is estimated based on the amount for which the asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
for our acquisitions  the majority of the purchase price that is not allocated to identifiable assets  or liabilities assumed  is accounted for as residual goodwill rather than identifiable intangible assets 
this stems from the value associated with the walk in customer base of the acquired salons  the value of which is not recorded as an identifiable intangible asset under current accounting guidance and the limited value of the acquired leased site and customer preference associated with the acquired hair salon brand 
residual goodwill further represents our opportunity to strategically combine the acquired business with our existing structure to serve a greater number of customers through our expansion strategies 
identifiable intangible assets purchased in fiscal year  and acquisitions totaled  and million  respectively 
the residual goodwill generated by fiscal year  and acquisitions totaled  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition company owned salon revenues  certain beauty school revenues and certain hair restoration center revenues that do not require us to perform any future services or deliver any future products are recorded at the time of sale 
this accounting treatment results in revenue recognition at the time that services are provided or products are delivered and the customer s payment is received 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
based on historical results  refunds to the customer represent less than one percent of total company owned revenues 
the vast majority of returns and refunds occur within a matter of days of the original sales transaction 
the majority of beauty school tuition payments are originally recorded as deferred revenues 
the earnings process is culminated once we perform under the terms of the contract ie  instruct a class 
therefore  revenue is recognized proportionally based on actual or scheduled class hours 
based on this practice  little judgment is exercised related to recognizing beauty school tuition revenues 
however  we must estimate our expected exposure to refunds and uncollectible accounts  which are recorded as a reduction to tuition revenues or charged to expense based on estimated amounts at the time of sale and at the time of occurrence of these events 
a significant variance between expected and actual refunds could have a material impact on revenues disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
payments for services performed under customer contracts covering a specified time span in the hair restoration centers are originally recorded as deferred revenues 
the earnings process is culminated  and revenue is recognized  once we perform under the terms of the contract 
our policy is to recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the course of a customer s contract period  which could vary slightly from the actual timing of services performed under the contract 
cost of product used and sold product costs are determined by applying estimated gross profit margins to service and product revenues  which are based on historical factors including product pricing trends and estimated shrinkage 
in addition  the estimated gross profit margin is adjusted based on the results of physical inventory counts performed at least twice a year and the monthly monitoring of factors that could impact our usage rates estimates 
these factors include mix of service sales  discounting and special promotions 
during fiscal year  we performed physical inventory counts beginning in september  february and may  and adjusted our estimated gross profit margin to reflect the results of the observations 
significant changes in product costs  volumes or shrinkage could have a material impact on our gross margin 
self insurance accruals we use a combination of third party insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  health insurance and general liability claims 
the liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheet represents an estimate of the undiscounted ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors prepared by independent third party actuaries 
these development factors utilize historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from the estimates  self insurance accruals could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
during fiscal year  and  our insurance costs were  and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense compensation expense for stock based compensation is estimated on the grant date using the lattice binomial option pricing model 
during fiscal years  and  stock based compensation expense totaled  and million  respectively 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
accruals are recorded for such contingencies based on our assessment that the occurrence is probable  and where determinable  an estimate of the liability amount 
management considers many factors in making these assessments including past history and the specifics of each case 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  we incurred a charge of million related to the settlement of a wage and hour lawsuit under the flsa 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
certain of these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
management must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that will not be ultimately recoverable 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which it is determined that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
management recognizes potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in the united states  fiscal years and after remain open for federal tax audit 
for state tax audits  the statute of limitations generally spans three to four years  resulting in a number of states remaining open for tax audits dating back to fiscal year internationally including canada  the statute of limitations for tax audits varies by jurisdiction  but generally ranges from three to five years 
overview of fiscal year results the following summarizes key aspects of our fiscal year results revenues increased percent to billion and consolidated same store sales increased percent during fiscal year same store sales were negatively impacted by the long hair cycle  as customers tend to cut their hair less often than when they have a short or shaped look 
earnings per share increased to per diluted share  up from per diluted share in fiscal year on april   our board of directors announced the termination of the merger agreement  dated january   whereby one of our subsidiaries was to merge with the sally beauty company business unit of alberto culver company 
the merger agreement was terminated following alberto culver s announcement that the alberto culver board of directors had withdrawn its recommendation to the stockholders of alberto culver that they approve the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 
as a result of the terminated merger  fiscal year earnings included a million million net of tax net gain representing the receipt of a million termination fee  net of acquisition related expenses incurred prior to the acquisition 
we recognized million million net of tax of impairment charges  primarily related to impaired long lived salon assets associated with underperforming salons 
we recorded a million million net of tax impairment loss related to an investment that we had recorded under the cost method 
an aggregate million million net of tax of expense was recognized during the fourth quarter stemming from our decision to close underperforming company owned salon locations and refocus efforts on improving the sales and operations of nearby salons 
the salon closures resulted in million  or million tax effected  in lease termination fees recorded within rent expense in the consolidated statement of operations  as well as million  or million tax effected  in losses on the disposal of the salons property and equipment recorded within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations 
included in the fourth quarter general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statement of operations is million million net of tax related to the settlement of a fair labor standards act flsa lawsuit over wage and hour disputes 
total debt at the end of the fiscal year was million and our debt to capitalization ratio  calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and shareholder s equity  improved basis points to percent as compared to the prior fiscal year 
results of operations consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information derived from our consolidated statement of operations in item  expressed as a percent of revenues 
the percentages are computed as a percent of total revenues  except as noted 
for the years ended june  service revenues product revenues franchise royalties and fees operating expenses cost of service cost of product site operating expenses general and administrative rent depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment terminated acquisition income  net operating income income before income taxes net income computed as a percent of service revenues and excludes depreciation expense 
computed as a percent of product revenues and excludes depreciation expense 
consolidated revenues consolidated revenues primarily include revenues of company owned salons  product and equipment sales to franchisees  beauty schools revenues  hair restoration center revenues  and franchise royalties and fees 
as compared to the prior fiscal year  consolidated revenues increased percent to a record billion during fiscal year and percent to billion during fiscal year the following table details our consolidated revenues by concept 
all service revenues  product revenues which include product and equipment sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees are included within their respective concept within the table 
for the periods ended june  dollars in thousands north american salons regis mastercuts trade secret smartstyle strip center total north american salons international salons beauty schools hair restoration centers consolidated revenues percent change from prior year salon same store sales increase includes aggregate franchise royalties and fees of  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
north american salon franchise royalties and fees represented  and percent of total franchise revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
salon same store sales increases or decreases are calculated on a daily basis as the total change in sales for company owned salons which were open on a specific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior period 
annual salon same store sales increases are the sum of the same store sales increases computed on a daily basis 
relocated salons are included in same store sales as they are considered to have been open in the prior period 
international same store sales are calculated in local currencies so that foreign currency fluctuations do not impact the calculation 
management believes that same store sales  a component of organic growth  are useful in order to help determine the increase in salon revenues attributable to its organic growth new salon construction and same store sales growth versus growth from acquisitions 
the and percent increases in consolidated revenues during fiscal year and  respectively  were driven by the following percentage increase decrease in revenues for the years ended june  factor acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency franchise revenues closed salons we acquired and company owned salons during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  including franchise buybacks during fiscal year and during fiscal year additionally  we acquired and beauty schools in fiscal year and  respectively  as well as eight seven of which were franchise buybacks and company owned hair restoration centers in fiscal year and  respectively 
the organic growth stemmed primarily from the construction of and company owned salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  as well as consolidated same store sales increases 
during fiscal year  the foreign currency impact was driven by the strengthening of the united states dollar against the british pound and euro as compared to the prior fiscal year s exchange rates  partially offset by the continued weakening of the united states dollar against the canadian dollar 
during fiscal year  the foreign currency impact was driven by the weakening of the united states dollar against the british pound  euro and canadian dollar as compared to the prior periods exchange rates 
the impact of foreign currency was calculated by multiplying current year revenues in local currencies by the change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year 
consolidated revenues are primarily composed of service and product revenues  as well as franchise royalties and fees 
fluctuations in these three major revenue categories were as follows service revenues 
service revenues include revenues generated from company owned salons  tuition and service revenues generated within our beauty schools  and service revenues generated by hair restoration centers 
total service revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands the growth in service revenues in fiscal year and were driven primarily by acquisitions including the acquisition of the hair restoration centers at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year and organic growth in our salons new salon construction and same store sales growth 
during fiscal year and continuing into fiscal years and  same store service sales in our salons continued to be modest due to a slight lengthening of customer visitation patterns stemming from a fashion trend towards longer hairstyles 
product revenues 
product revenues are primarily sales at company owned salons  beauty schools  hair restoration centers  and sales of product and equipment to franchisees 
total product revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands the growth in fiscal year product revenues was primarily due to acquisitions 
fiscal year and product revenue percentage increases were not as robust as the prior fiscal years primarily due to lower same store product sales increases in our company owned salons  same store product sales increased percent in fiscal year and were flat in fiscal year the large increase in same store product sales during fiscal year was primarily driven by a trend towards sales of higher priced beauty tools  such as flat irons and the introduction of the matrix product line to trade secret salons 
franchise royalties and fees 
total franchise revenues  which include royalties and franchise fees  were as follows decrease increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  revenues dollar percentage dollars in thousands total franchise locations open at june  and were  including franchise hair restoration centers and  including franchise hair restoration centers  respectively 
the decreased number of franchise locations during fiscal year was primarily due to franchise buybacks  and strip center and international franchise salon closures 
during fiscal year  the number of franchise locations grew modestly  as new salon construction and the acquisition of the hair restoration centers were largely offset by franchise buybacks and closures 
we purchased and of our franchise salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
additionally  we purchased seven of our franchise hair restoration centers during fiscal year a total of and franchise salons were closed during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in consolidated franchise revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
exclusive of foreign currency fluctuations  consolidated franchise revenues decreased percent over the prior fiscal year  stemming from our purchase of franchise salons and seven franchise hair restoration centers during fiscal year favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused percent of the percent increase in consolidated franchise revenues during the year ended june  exclusive of the effect of this favorable currency fluctuation  consolidated franchise revenues increased percent in the year ended june  the fiscal year increase was primarily due to the acquisition of franchise hair restoration centers  as well as opening more new international franchise salons during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross margin excluding depreciation our cost of revenues primarily includes labor costs related to salon employees  beauty school instructors and hair restoration center employees  the cost of product used in providing services and the cost of products sold to customers and franchisees 
the resulting gross margin was as follows margin as of total service and product increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in total margin as a percent of service and product revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
service margin excluding depreciation 
service margin was as follows service margin as of increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin service revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in service margin as a percent of service revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the basis point improvement in service margins during fiscal year was primarily due to improved payroll and payroll related costs 
the basis point decrease in service margins during the year ended june  was primarily related to increased payroll taxes and an increased cost of goods used in services during fiscal year product margin excluding depreciation 
product margin was as follows product margin as of increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  margin product revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in product margin as a percent of product revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in product margins during fiscal year was primarily related to including product sales from the hair restoration centers  which have higher product margins than sales of retail products in salons  for the full year as compared to seven months since the date of acquisition during the prior fiscal year 
this benefit was partially offset by reduced sales margins realized on several vendor product lines repackaged during the fiscal year 
the improvement in product margins for the year ended june  was due to the impact of including product sales in the hair restoration centers in our operations for approximately half of the year the acquisition closed in december  which have higher product margins than our salon business 
this favorable impact was softened by an upward adjustment to the usage percentage to reflect current trends towards the sale of lower margin products and an increase to our slow moving product reserve in response to changing product lines 
site operating expenses this expense category includes direct costs incurred by our salons  beauty schools and hair restoration centers  such as on site advertising  workers compensation  insurance  utilities and janitorial costs 
site operating expenses were as follows expense as site of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  operating revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in site operating expenses as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the fiscal year improvement in site operating expenses as a percent of revenues was primarily due to reduced workers compensation insurance related costs stemming from decreased claims activity 
the basis point improvement in site operating expenses during the year ended june  was primarily due to the addition of the hair restoration centers in december  which have lower site operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative g a includes costs associated with our field supervision  salon training and promotions  product distribution centers and corporate offices such as salaries and professional fees  including costs incurred to support franchise  beauty school and hair restoration center operations 
g a expenses were as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  g a revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in g a as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
as a percent of revenues  g a expenses were slightly higher as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to million related to the settlement of a fair labor standards act flsa lawsuit over wage and hour disputes 
excluding the ten basis point impact of this settlement  g a expenses were relatively consistent as a percent of revenues compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in g a expenses as a percent of total revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to the addition of the hair restoration centers  which have slightly higher g a costs as a percent of total revenues due to the marketing intensive nature of that business  as well as increased professional fees related to the june  sarbanes oxley compliance effort and legal fees stemming from a lawsuit related to the flsa 
additionally  we identified an issue relating to the potential taxability of certain benefits provided to our employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we established an accrual during our fourth fiscal quarter to address this matter and remain in the process of resolving this issue 
rent rent expense  which includes base and percentage rent  common area maintenance and real estate taxes  was as follows expense as of total increase over prior fiscal year years ended june  rent revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in rent expense as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  million in lease termination costs were recognized through rent expense 
these costs resulted from our decision to close company owned salon locations and refocus efforts on improving the sales and operations of nearby salons 
additionally  the increase in this fixed cost expense as a percent of total revenues was due to salon rent increasing at a faster rate than salon same store sales during both fiscal year and depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense d a was as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year periods ended june  d a revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the fiscal year basis point increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to increased salon impairment charges during fiscal year stemming from lower same store sales volumes during recent fiscal years 
impairment charges of and million were recognized for the north american and international operations  respectively  during fiscal year additionally  million in losses on disposal of property and equipment was recognized related to the fourth quarter closure of salons 
we decided to close these company owned salon locations in order to refocus efforts on improving the sales and operations of nearby salons 
the fiscal year basis point increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets that we acquired in the acquisition of the hair restoration centers during the second quarter of fiscal year interest interest expense was as follows expense as of total increase decrease over prior fiscal year years ended june  interest revenues dollar percentage basis point dollars in thousands represents the basis point change in interest expense as a percent of total revenues as compared to the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense during the years ended june  and was primarily due to an increase in our debt level stemming from fiscal year and acquisition activity  including additional beauty schools and the fiscal year acquisition of the hair restoration centers 
additionally  increased borrowing rates contributed to the fiscal year increase in interest expense as a percent of total revenues 
income taxes our reported effective tax rate was as follows effective basis point increase years ended june  rate improvement the improvement in the overall effective tax rate during fiscal year was related to the prior year goodwill impairment charge in the international salon segment  which was non deductible for tax purposes 
the goodwill impairment caused an percent increase in the fiscal year tax rate 
excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment  the increase in the fiscal year tax rate over the prior year was primarily due to the elimination of the work opportunity credits  which expired on december  during fiscal year  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment  the improvement in the effective tax rate over fiscal year was primarily due to the successful settlement of our federal audit and the retroactive reinstatement of the work opportunity credit during fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation we compensate some of our salon employees with percentage commissions based on sales they generate  thereby enabling salon payroll expense as a percent of company owned salon revenues to remain relatively constant 
accordingly  this provides us certain protection against inflationary increases  as payroll expense and related benefits our major expense components are variable costs of sales 
in addition  we may increase pricing in our salons to offset any significant increases in wages 
therefore  we do not believe inflation has had a significant impact on the results of our operations 
constant currency presentation the presentation below demonstrates the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from year to year 
to present this information  current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year 
therefore  the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
in the year ended june   foreign currency translation had a negative impact on total consolidated revenues due to the weakening of the british pound and euro against the united states dollar  partially offset by the continuing strengthening of the canadian dollar 
during fiscal year  foreign currency translation had a positive impact on total consolidated revenues due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  british pound and euro 
favorable unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact on revenues impact on income before income taxes currency fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands canadian dollar british pound euro total results of operations by segment based on our internal management structure  we report four segments north american salons  international salons  beauty schools and hair restoration centers 
significant results of operations are discussed below with respect to each of these segments 
north american salons north american salon revenues 
total north american salon revenues were as follows increase over prior fiscal year same store years ended june  revenues dollar percentage sales increase dollars in thousands the percentage increases during the years ended june  and were due to the following factors percentage increase decrease in revenues for the years ended june  acquisitions previous twelve months organic growth foreign currency franchise revenues closed salons we acquired and company owned north american salons during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  including and franchise buybacks 
the organic growth stemmed primarily from the construction of and company owned salons in north america during the twelve months ended june  and  respectively

additionally  rent and depreciation and amortization expenses increased as a percent of north american salon revenues due to lease termination costs and losses on the disposal of property and equipment stemming from salon closures 
during the fourth quarter  we decided to close company owned salon locations prior to the lease end date in order to refocus efforts on improving the sales and operations of nearby salons 
increased salon impairment charges during fiscal year  and lower same store sales volumes during recent fiscal years  also contributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization during fiscal year the decrease in north american salon operating income during the year ended june  was primarily related to decreased margins stemming from lower vendor rebates due to a decrease in our level of purchases from certain vendors during fiscal year  an upward adjustment to the usage percentage to reflect current trends towards the sale of lower margin products and an increase to our slow moving product reserve in response to changing product lines 
additionally  an adjustment to the weighted average cost associated with our private label product line negatively impacted our product margins in the north american salons

exclusive of the prior year goodwill impairment charge  operating income decreased basis points as a percentage of total international salon revenues 
this decrease was primarily due to the impact of certain fixed cost categories  such as rent and depreciation expense  measured as a percentage of lower same store sales  as well as the million of property and equipment impairment charges 
the decrease in international salon operating income during the year ended june  was due to the goodwill impairment charge discussed in the preceding paragraph 
the primary factor that led to the impairment charge was slower than expected growth of the european economy

therefore  the year over year fluctuations in beauty school operating income stem partially from our integration of the new beauty schools and changes in the mix of beauty schools due to these acquisitions 
during fiscal year  a reduced level of enrollments and an increase in dropped students had an unfavorable impact on operating income 
additionally  an increase to the bad debt reserve for uncollectible tuition related to inactive students and an increase in marketing expenses incurred to help bolster late summer and early fall enrollment impacted fiscal year operating income

among other changes  this amendment and restatement increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from million to million  extended the facility s expiration date to april  reduced the spread charged for certain borrowings under the facility  and modified certain financial covenants 
as so amended  the credit agreement includes financial covenants and other customary terms and conditions for credit facilities of this type 
the amended and restated revolving credit agreement contains several affirmative and negative covenants 
the most restrictive of these is a fixed charge coverage ratio test 
under the terms of the agreement  we may not allow our ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent expense ebitdar to fixed charges which includes rent and interest expenses to drop below on a rolling four quarter basis

the interest rates under the facility vary and are based on a bank s reference rate  the federal funds rate and or libor  as applicable  and a leverage ratio determined by a formula tied to our debt and adjusted income

on balance sheet obligations our long term obligations are composed primarily of senior term notes and a revolving credit facility 
certain senior term notes are hedged by contracts with financial institutions commonly referred to as interest rate swaps  as discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at june   approximately million of our long term obligations represents the fair value of the adjustment made to mark the hedged portion of the debt obligation to fair value a reduction to long term debt  offset by million representing a deferred gain related to the termination of certain interest rate hedge contracts 
interest payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations were estimated based on our total average interest rate at june  and scheduled contractual repayments 
other long term liabilities include a total of million related to a salary deferral program  million including million in interest related to established contractual payment obligations under retirement and severance payment agreements for a small number of retired employees and million related to the executive profit sharing plan see note 
this table excludes the short term liabilities  other than the current portion of long term debt  disclosed on our balance sheet as the amounts recorded for these items will be paid in the next year 
we have no unconditional purchase obligations  as defined by sfas no 
 disclosure of long term obligations 
also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payment estimates associated with employee health and workers compensation claims for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and workers compensation losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
the company has unfunded deferred compensation contracts covering certain management and executive personnel 
the deferred compensation contracts are offered to key executives based on their accomplishments within the company 
because we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments related to these contracts  such amounts were not included in the table above 
related obligations totaled and million at june  and  respectively  and are included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases primarily represent long term obligations for the rental of salon  school and hair restoration center premises  including leases for company owned locations  as well as future reimbursable salon franchisee lease payments of approximately million  which are funded by franchisees 
regarding the franchisee subleases  we generally retain the right to the related salon assets net of any outstanding obligations in the event of a default by a franchise owner 
management has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
other long term obligations represent our guarantees  primarily entered into prior to december   on a limited number of equipment lease agreements between our salon franchisees and leasing companies 
if the franchisee should fail to make payments in accordance with the lease  we will be held liable under such agreements and retain the right to possess the related salon operations 
we believe the fair value of the salon operations exceeds the maximum potential amount of future lease payments for which we could be held liable 
the existing guaranteed lease obligations  which have an aggregate undiscounted value of million at june   terminate at various dates between july and may the company has not experienced and does not expect any material loss to result from these arrangements 
in certain salon franchise area development agreements  a buyback program was included allowing the franchisee to require us to purchase all of their salon assets within a specified market for percent of their original cost within two years from the date of the franchisee opening their first salon 
as of june   three existing franchise salons were covered by such agreements and the related maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments was estimated to be approximately million 
this potential obligation is not included in the table above as the opportunity or the timing of the potential expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated 
we have not and do not expect to incur material expenditures under the buyback program as the program has been discontinued with respect to any new franchise area development agreements and most franchisees who were offered the program in the past choose to continue operating the salons themselves 
further  in the case of a franchisee initiating the buyback program  we anticipate finding another franchisee to purchase the salons directly rather than purchasing them ourselves 
we have interest rate swap contracts  forward foreign currency contracts  and a cross currency swap to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
future net settlements under these agreements are not included in the table above 
we are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters  which indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise  in the ordinary course of business 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases and other real estate contracts  financial agreements  agreements to provide services  and agreements to indemnify officers  directors and employees in the performance of their work 
while our aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  we are not aware of any current matter that we expect to result in a material liability 
we do not have other unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments such as commitments under lines of credit and standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
we have standby letters of credit for million primarily related to our self insurance program and department of education requirements surrounding title iv funding 
therefore  million of our committed line of credit under our revolving credit facility is restricted 
we are in compliance with all covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and senior notes 
additionally  the credit agreements do not include rating triggers or subjective clauses that would accelerate maturity dates 
as a part of our salon development program  we continue to negotiate and enter into leases and commitments for the acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements related to future salon locations  and continue to enter into transactions to acquire established hair care salons and businesses 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at june  as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
financing financing activities are discussed on pages and in note to the consolidated financial statements  and derivative activities are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes that cash generated from operations and amounts available under existing debt facilities will be sufficient to fund its anticipated capital expenditures  acquisitions and required debt repayments for the foreseeable future

originally  the program allowed up to million to be expended for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
the bod elected to increase this maximum to million in august  and then to million on may  the timing and amounts of any repurchases will depend on many factors  including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions 
the repurchases to date have been made primarily to eliminate the dilutive effect of shares issued in conjunction with acquisitions and stock option exercises 
as of june   and  a total accumulated  and million shares have been repurchased for  and million  respectively 
all repurchased shares are immediately retired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure of the company relates to changes in interest rates in connection with its debt  some of which bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable borrowing margin 
additionally  the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk related to its net investments in its foreign subsidiaries and  to a lesser extent  changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
the company has established policies and procedures that govern the management of these exposures through the use of derivative financial instrument contracts 
by policy  the company does not enter into such contracts for the purpose of speculation 
the following details the company s policies and use of financial instruments 
interest rate risk the company has established an interest rate management policy that attempts to minimize its overall cost of debt  while taking into consideration the earnings implications associated with the volatility of short term interest rates 
as part of this policy  the company has elected to maintain a combination of variable and fixed rate debt 
considering the company s policy of maintaining variable rate debt instruments  a one percent change in interest rates including the impact of existing interest rate swap contracts may impact the company s interest expense by approximately million 
considering the effect of interest rate swaps and including and million increases to long term debt related to fair value swaps at june  and  respectively  the company had the following outstanding debt balances june  dollars in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt the company manages its interest rate risk by continually assessing the amount of fixed and variable rate debt 
on occasion  the company uses interest rate swaps to further mitigate the risk associated with changing interest rates and to maintain its desired balances of fixed and floating rate debt 
in addition  the company has entered into the following financial instruments interest rate swap contracts the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable rate debt 
on occasion  the company uses interest rate swaps to further mitigate the risk associated with changing interest rates and to maintain its desired balances of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the terms of the interest rate swap agreements contain quarterly settlement dates based on the notional amounts of the swap contracts 
pay fixed rates  receive variable rates on october   the company entered into interest rate swap contracts that pay fixed rates of interest and receive variable rates of interest based on the three month libor rate on notional amounts of indebtedness of and million at june   and mature in march and march  respectively 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges 
the company had an interest rate swap contract that paid fixed rates of interest and received variable rates of interest based on the three month libor rate on notional amounts of indebtedness of million at june   which was accounted for as a cash flow swap 
this swap contract matured in june and  therefore  the company held no cash flow swaps at the end of fiscal year during fiscal year  the million interest rate swap was redesignated from a hedge of variable rate operating lease obligations to hedge of a portion of the interest payments associated with the company s long term financing program 
the redesignation was the result of the company exercising its right to purchase the property under the variable rate operating lease 
see the discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
pay variable rates  receive fixed rates the company has interest rate swap contracts that pay variable rates of interest based on the three month and six month libor rates plus a credit spread and receive fixed rates of interest on an aggregate and million notional amount at june  and  respectively  with maturation dates between july and july these swaps were designated as hedges of a portion of the company s senior term notes and are being accounted for as fair value swaps 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company terminated a portion of its million interest rate swap contract  thereby lowering the aggregate notional amount by million 
this remaining notional amount of million was terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

however  because a portion of the company s operations consists of activities outside of the united states  the company has transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound and euro 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to translate the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
different exchange rates from period to period impact the amounts of reported income and the amount of foreign currency translation recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as part of its risk management strategy  the company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations 
as a result  the company may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
as of june   the company has entered into the following financial instruments hedge of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries the company has a cross currency swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of its net investments in its foreign operations

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
forward foreign currency contracts the company s exposure to foreign exchange risk includes risks related to fluctuations in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
the exposure to canadian dollar exchange rates on the company s fiscal year cash flows primarily includes payments in canadian dollars from the company s canadian salon operations for retail inventory exported from the united states 
the company seeks to manage exposure to changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
in order to do so  the company entered into forward currency contracts during fiscal year to reduce the risk of significant negative impact on its us dollar cash flows or income 
the company does not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy million us dollars were outstanding as of june  to hedge forecasted intercompany foreign currency denominated transactions stemming from monthly product shipments from the us to canadian salons
