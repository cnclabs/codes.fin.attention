item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iomega designs and markets products that help our customers protect  secure  capture and share their valuable digital information 
our reportable segments are based primarily on the nature of our products and include zip products  consumer storage solutions css products  rev products  network storage systems nss products and other products 
the zip products segment involves the distribution and sale of zip drives and disks to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems throughout the world 
the consumer storage solutions products segment involves the worldwide distribution of various storage devices including external hard drives hdd  cd rw drives  dvd rewritable drives  usb flash drives and external floppy disk drives 
the rev products segment involves the development  distribution and sale of rev products to retailers  distributors  oems and resellers throughout the world 
the nss products segment consists primarily of the development  distribution and sale of network attached storage servers in the entry level and low end network attached storage market 
the other products segment consists of license and patent fee income and products that have been discontinued or are otherwise immaterial  including jaz and pocketzip disks  peerless drive systems  iomega software products such as iomega automatic backup software and other miscellaneous products 
since  the zip products segment has been the largest contributor to our product profit margin ppm 
as the zip business has approached the end of its product life cycle  we have been trying to find other profitable sources of revenue to replace the declining high gross margin zip revenue 
in recent years  we have invested significant efforts and dollars on the development of rev products  which were launched in the second quarter of the rev products segment has yet to be profitable at the ppm level due primarily to development costs  including for next generation rev products  significant marketing expenses to generate market awareness and under absorbed fixed overhead expenses at the current sales volumes 
however  the rev products segment approached break even at the ppm level in the fourth quarter of in other efforts to replace the declining zip business  we have launched and attempted to expand our css and nss businesses 
sales of the css business segment now exceed zip product sales 
however  our css business segment has not generated significant gross margins and is not profitable 
the nss business has also incurred losses during each year of its existence including the year ended december  as part of an ongoing effort to return to profitability  we announced restructuring actions in july of  which were substantially completed during the third quarter of the restructuring actions are part of an effort to align our cost structure with our expected future revenue levels 
we anticipate million to million in annual savings from these restructuring actions 
for  our primary goals are to focus on growing our rev product sales through system integrator programs to generate awareness  server oem transactions and adoption in targeted vertical markets such as the professional audio video market  diversify our rev product assortment in the market through the introduction of new rev products of varying capacities  improve hdd product gross margins through channel mix  product mix and cost reductions and evaluate other strategic opportunities in the small business market segment to facilitate long term growth 
we believe that we must make significant progress in these four areas in order to achieve our goal to return the company to profitability 
while we are focused on this goal  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goal 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued at december   our total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and temporary investments were million see the liquidity and capital resources discussion for more detail on the tax impacts of repatriating foreign cash 
we believe our total cash is sufficient to operate the business for at least one year 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments occur include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  price protection and rebate reserves  inventory valuation reserves  accrued excess purchase commitments  tax valuation allowances and impairment of goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition we defer recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds our channels four week requirements as estimated by us 
original equipment manufacturers oems and value added resellers vars customers are not considered to have excess inventory  as they usually do not carry more than four weeks of inventory 
we estimate the distribution  retail and catalog channels four week requirements based on inventory and sell through amounts reported to us by our key customers  who make up the substantial majority of our sales in these channels 
no adjustment is made for those customers that do not report inventory and sell through information 
this inventory and sell through information is reported to us at the stock keeping unit sku level 
however  for purposes of our excess inventory calculation  this information is accumulated at the major product level ie zip mb drive  zip mb drive  etc we use the last weeks of reported sell through information to calculate a weekly average  which is then used to estimate the channels four week requirements 
this estimate may not be indicative of four weeks of future sell through 
we defer sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in our consolidated statements of operations  with the resulting offset being reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in margin on deferred revenue 
the table below shows the related revenue and cost of sales deferrals associated with the estimated excess channel inventory 
december  in thousands deferred revenue deferred cost of sales margin on estimated channel inventory 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued the decrease in margin on estimated channel inventory during reflects lower levels of channel inventory and product mix changes away from high margin zip products to lower margin products 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to excess channel inventory are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the variability of the different inputs to the calculation of the reserve such as changes in the level of channel inventory and channel sell through rates and the material impact that changes in these inputs can have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue 
excess channel inventory is a critical estimate for all segments of our business 
since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in excess channel inventory accruals would not impact our liquidity 
price protection and rebate reserves we have agreements with some of our direct and indirect customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to certain limitations a credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units in the customer s inventory on the date of the price decrease not to exceed the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  we establish reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  we record reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and other estimated rebates given to consumers at the time of purchase from channel partners for which sales have been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
we use price protection and rebate programs in all of our segments and record the charges in our statement of operations against their respective segment 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to price protection and rebate programs are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the assumptions made concerning redemption rates and other variables and changes in this reserve can have a material impact on sales and trade receivables 
price protection and rebate reserves have fluctuated in the past 
for example  during  million of price protection and rebate reserves that were recorded in prior periods were released  as they were not claimed as originally estimated 
reserves for volume and other rebates and price protection totaled million at december  and million at december  and are netted against trade receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in this reserve for was primarily a reflection of lower rebate and price protection programs during relative to the lower sales in we believe that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy 
since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in price protection and rebate accruals would not impact our liquidity 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued inventory valuation reserves we evaluate the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices including known future price decreases 
we include product costs and direct selling expenses in our analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  we generally consider inventory that is not expected to be sold within established timelines  as forecasted by our material requirements planning system  as excess and thus appropriate inventory reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to inventory valuation reserves are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products and future sales prices  the competitive nature of the technology industry which can quickly change the price of our products in the market place or the overall demand for our products and changes in the value of inventory can have a material impact on cost of sales and inventory valuation reserves 
inventory valuation reserve adjustments are necessitated primarily from changes in estimating future sales volumes and from changes in the estimates made of future sales prices 
estimating future sales volumes is particularly difficult for new products and end of life eol products 
estimating future sales price is particularly difficult on css products due to price competition and short product cycles 
zip products have shown a long market life compared to our other products 
in light of their high margins  its inventory carrying value has been recoverable at estimated selling prices 
consequently  zip products have not  until recently  been as susceptible to inventory valuation reserve adjustments as some of our other products 
now  as zip products reach the end of their product life cycle  zip products and components have become susceptible to excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
if zip volumes decline at a quicker rate or in greater volumes than forecasted  the risk associated with inventory valuation reserves will increase 
during  we recorded a net decrease in inventory valuation reserves of million 
the million decrease was comprised of additions of million less utilization of million as reserved product was scrapped or sold 
the million of additions to inventory valuation reserves were comprised of million for css products  million for zip products  million for rev products  million for nss products  with the remaining million for other various products 
the million of css products charges related primarily to write downs of inventory to market costs and excess inventory on certain hdd products that were not selling as originally expected 
the million inventory reserve utilizations were comprised of million for zip products  million for css products  million for nss products  and million for other various products as products were sold or scrapped 
the zip products utilization related primarily to zip product assemblies scrapped in the second quarter of during  we recorded a net decrease in inventory valuation reserves of million 
the million decrease was comprised of additions of million less utilization of million as reserved product was scrapped or sold 
the million additions to inventory valuation reserves were comprised of million for zip products  million for css products and million for nss products  with the remaining million for other various products 
the million zip charges resulted primarily from purchased eol components  which exceeded the eol volume forecast 
the million css products charges resulted primarily from product priced below cost in order to move the inventory 
the million of nss product 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued charges resulted primarily from additional nas and tape product write offs in early related to the announcement in late regarding the discontinuance of the high end of the market nas servers and tape products 
the million inventory reserve utilizations were primarily for zip  css and nas products as product was sold or scrapped 
at december   we had inventory valuation reserves of million  which compares to inventory valuation reserves of million at december  the decrease of million in inventory valuation reserves during was primarily attributable to decreases in reserves as described above 
adjustments to inventory reserves are non cash adjustments and would not affect our liquidity 
accrued excess purchase commitments the purchase orders under which we buy many of our products generally extend one to three quarters in the future 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on forecasted future sales requirements 
it is difficult to estimate future product demand for new products or products with declining sales 
such estimates may result in excess purchase commitments  where we make commitments for purchases that we do not ultimately utilize 
the accrual for excess purchase commitments also includes liabilities such as cancellation charges or handling fees incurred because of excess supplier inventory or equipment 
with the continuing decline of zip volumes  this has become an area of particular risk for us 
suppliers of certain critical components of both zip drives and disks have stopped producing  or eol d such components and other suppliers are planning to do so 
in such cases  we attempt to make an eol purchase of the required component s based on our estimates of all future requirements 
with respect to estimating excess purchase commitments  we are at risk that we will order insufficient or excess quantities of key components or that certain suppliers may produce excess inventory of key components in the absence of firm orders from us  leading to potential disputes regarding payment obligations 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to accrued excess purchase commitments are critical accounting estimates because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of products  the inherit difficulty of estimating future requirements or final build out of components that have been eol d by the supplier and decisions to discontinue projects with suppliers 
during  we recorded a net increase in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this increase was comprised of million of additions less utilizations of million 
the additions of million increase resulted from million for css products primarily hdd products  million for zip products and million for rev products 
the million of utilizations resulted primarily from million for zip products  million for css products  million for rev products  and the remaining million for other various products 
during  we recorded a net decrease in excess purchase commitment reserves of million 
this decrease was comprised of million of additions less utilization of million 
the majority of the million increase resulted from zip product exposures at our manufacturing suppliers because of decreases in the eol forecast 
the million of utilizations resulted primarily from zip and css products as much of what was utilized came from prior reserves and was primarily paid to suppliers  product was moved into inventory or reserves reduced due to increases in forecast demand 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued the accrual for excess purchase commitments totaled million at december  and million at december  since we have no material debt and adequate cash balances  we believe that changes in accrued excess purchase commitments would not impact our liquidity 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
during this evaluation  we review our forecasts of income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease our tax provision or benefit 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provision benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheet 
for example  during  we recorded an million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was a million increased valuation allowance resulting from a decrease in the deferred tax liability because of a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
additionally during  we recorded a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings 
the recording of the new foreign tax credits was the result of a change in our intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future 
the valuation allowance was also increased as the result of a decrease in the deferred tax liability of million resulting from a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
adjustments to deferred tax valuation allowances are non cash adjustments and do not affect our cash flows 
impairment of goodwill we have million of goodwill  all of which is associated with the zip products segment 
we expect to experience non cash impairment charges as zip sales and profits continue to decline 
we will be required to take these charges in and we expect that the charges could begin as early as the first quarter 
we perform our annual impairment test required under sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets sfas in the first quarter of each year 
this test compares our zip specific assets intangibles and inventory to the estimated future  discounted cash flows to determine if these cash flows will cover the assets 
each quarter  we compare how actual quarterly zip profits are tracking with the projected zip profits cash 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued application of critical accounting policies continued flows that were used in the annual impairment test to make sure that there has not been a significant adverse change in business climate or that an unforeseen trend has developed 
as part of this quarterly review  we also look for any other indicators of impairment  such as any significant adverse changes in legal factors  adverse regulatory assessments or loss of key personnel 
although there were indicators of impairment during  the estimated discounted future cash flows were adequate to cover the carrying value of the zip goodwill as of december  we believe that the accounting estimates related to assessing potential impairment of our goodwill are critical accounting estimates because the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of the zip products segment and the impact that future impairment charges will have on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheet 
future zip goodwill impairment charges will be non cash charges and will not affect our cash flows

seasonality our consumer products business is typically strongest during the fourth quarter 
our european sales are typically weakest during the third quarter due to summer holidays 
given the continued expected decline of the zip business  we are unable to estimate or forecast any zip product seasonality in future quarters with any degree of confidence 
there can be no assurance that any historic sales patterns will continue and  as a result  sales for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales to be expected in any future quarter

while consolidated under fin  bytetaxi  inc was reported under the css segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached an agreement to sell our investment in bytetaxi  inc specifically  on october   iomega  bytetaxi  inc  and certain major shareholders of bytetaxi  inc 
entered into a termination agreement  under which we would receive a total of million payable as described below in return for the sale of our equity ownership of bytetaxi  inc and termination of our distribution rights to foldershare tm software 
this agreement was part of a larger series of transactions whereby microsoft corporation purchased all of the stock of bytetaxi  inc we received a cash payment of million on october  and the remaining funds approximately million are to be paid during the fourth quarter of  subject to the satisfaction of certain escrow and indemnity terms 
the escrow and indemnity provisions relate to customary representations and warranties by selling shareholders relating to title  intellectual property issues  tax liabilities or other post closing adjustments 
upon the sale of our ownership interest in bytetaxi  inc  we ceased to be the primary beneficiary of bytetaxi s operations 
consequently  bytetaxi  inc has been deconsolidated at december   as per fin under fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fasb  the sale of bytetaxi  inc was treated as a discontinued operation

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales dct technology was a small form factor flexible media technology previously developed by iomega 
in  we undertook an analysis and objective evaluation of the market environment in which the dct technology would compete and decided not to proceed with the dct development rather  we would seek to license the technology 
as part of the wind down activities during third quarter  we determined that fixed assets related solely to the dct technology were impaired and thus during recorded as cost of sales  million of impairment charges 
this million charge was attributable entirely to the other products business segment 
the fair value of the assets was determined based on industry knowledge and from the disposition of similar assets in the past 
during  we also recorded million of other charges for cancelled commitments  comprised primarily of supplier claims  for equipment and parts that had been committed to by our suppliers as well as second tier suppliers 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a definitive license agreement regarding our dct intellectual property 
the license agreement terms included an upfront cash payment of million to us and an additional million cash payment to us at a later date based upon the licensee s commercialization date of the technology  but no later than november further  the license agreement calls for potential royalties to be paid on any future products utilizing the technology up to million  we believe that work on certain products was recently suspended that would utilize the technology  so potential royalties from that transaction are unlikely 
the million was reflected as a benefit to operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations under the caption  license and patent fee income  as the cash had been received and we have fulfilled all of our obligations related to that payment 
we will not recognize the million in our financial statements until the related cash payment is received 
there is no guarantee that we will receive any future payments from this transaction 
during the license agreement negotiations  we also entered into other agreements  including the sale of various fixed assets  primarily testing equipment and miscellaneous engineering equipment that iomega had used as part of the dct program 
we received million of cash for these assets resulting in a gain of million 
the breakout of the gain between cost of sales and research and development was determined based upon where the initial expense to purchase the respective assets was recorded

of the million of restructuring charges  million was for cash charges and million was for non cash charges 
the north america activities consisted of outsourcing our distribution center in north carolina and terminating the related lease  closing several sales offices in the united states and consolidating operations at our north america facilities primarily roy  utah  all of which resulted in a workforce reduction of regular employees and temporary staff across all business functions and across all levels of the organization

the zip products segment involves the distribution and sale of zip drives and disks to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems throughout the world 
our consumer storage solutions css segment involves the worldwide distribution and sale of various storage devices including external hard disk drives hdd  cd rw drives  dvd rewritable drives  usb flash drives and external floppy disk drives 
during the second half of  we began to focus this segment on hdd products 
in some cases  we perform final assembly work of purchased components  and in other cases  we purchase and resell substantially complete products 
business products the business products category formerly professional storage products category is comprised of rev products and network storage systems segments 
the rev products segment involves the development  distribution and sale of rev products to retailers  distributors  oems and resellers throughout the world 
the rev drives are removable hard disk storage systems 
rev products began shipping in april the network storage systems nss segment consists primarily of the development  distribution and sale of network attached storage servers in the entry level and low end network attached storage market 
other products the other products segment consists of license and patent fee income and products that have been discontinued or are otherwise immaterial  including jaz and pocketzip disks  peerless drive systems  iomega software products such as iomega automatic backup software and other miscellaneous products 
the other products segment included the research and development of the digital capture technology dct development program  which was cancelled in the second half of product profit margin we evaluate product segment performance based on product profit margin ppm 
ppm is defined as sales and other income related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable product costs  research and development expenses  product management expenses  specific selling and marketing expenses and depreciation and amortization related to a segment s operations 
when such costs and expenses exceed sales and other income  ppm is referred to as a product loss 
the accounting policies of the product segments are the same as those described in note intersegment sales  eliminated in consolidation  are not material

oem sales have declined rapidly and the availability of zip products as configure to order options were discontinued in by leading oems 
we expect zip drive and disk sales to continue to decrease due to the obsolescence of the zip technology as zip products approach the end of their product life cycle 
in addition  we expect to cease selling zip drives to distributors or resellers in the european union starting july   in the wake of the restriction of hazardous substances rohs initiative 
notwithstanding rohs  our distributors and resellers are permitted and expected to continue to sell zip products from their inventories after the july date 
sales of css products represented of total sales for  compared to for the percentage of total sales increased in due to lower total consolidated especially zip products sales 
the million decrease in css products sales was comprised of a million decrease in optical sales  a decrease of million in iomega mini and micro mini usb flash drives and a decrease of million in floppy external drives sales  partially offset by an increase of million in hdd drives 
the css products sales decline was primarily driven by our third quarter decision to eliminate certain unprofitable optical and mini usb flash drive products 
rev product sales represented of total sales for  compared to for rev products began shipping in april rev sales increased by million in from million of sales in the increase is largely due to our efforts to make rev products a significant part of our overall product portfolio

years ended december  change change in thousands  except total gross margin dollars total gross margin zip gross margin total gross margin dollars in decreased primarily from lower overall sales and from a lower proportion of higher margin zip product sales 
the lower gross margin percentage was primarily due to a lower proportion of zip product sales and lower css products gross margin percentages  partially offset by higher rev sales and gross margin percentages 
gross margins for included million of net impairment and other charges related to the discontinuance of the dct program 
the zip product gross margin percentage increased in primarily from the and restructuring actions and the fact that the gross margin contained higher eol charges 
total zip product gross margin dollars decreased due to significantly lower zip product sales 
we anticipate that future zip product gross margin percentage will fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter as zip product sales continue to decline 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued css products gross margins declined in terms of both dollars and percentages during the decrease in gross margin dollars was primarily due to lower optical  mini usb flash and floppy sales and pricing and other programs related to hdd drives 
the lower optical and mini usb sales are a result of our decision to eliminate unprofitable skus in the optical and mini usb flash product lines 
all css products faced competitive pricing pressures during the year ended december  and we anticipate continued competitive pricing pressures on these products in the future 
rev product gross margins improved in terms of both dollars and percentages during  due to steady volume increases and the lack of the manufacturing start up costs 
future gross margin percentages will depend on a number of factors including the future sales volume of zip and rev products  achievement of rev sales growth and hdd product gross margin goals  the successful launch of the next generation rev products  pricing actions or promotions  the mix between zip products compared to css  rev and nss products  sales volumes of zip disks  which generate significantly higher gross margin percentages than the corresponding drives  the impact of rising zip manufacturing costs and eol material charges  the impact of supply chain improvements on css products margins  the strength or weakness of foreign currencies  especially the euro  the impact of any future material cost changes  supply or other disruptions  the ability to avoid future inventory and fixed asset charges  the impact of any future restructuring charges  the ability to accurately forecast future product demand  the ability to cover fixed costs associated with newly introduced products  start up costs associated with the introduction of new products  price competition from other substitute third party storage products  possible payment of license royalties to resolve alleged patent infringement disputes and general economic conditions

we anticipate future volatility and declines in zip ppm as the segment reaches the end of its life cycle

see the discussion above entitled  dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales for more detail regarding the license agreement 
licensing is not a part of our major or central operations and thus the dct transaction was considered a gain rather than revenue 
since the license fees recaptured costs that resulted directly from our research and development activities  the license fees were considered to be a part of operations and thus were shown as a separate line item of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
bad debt bad debt credits were consistent in when compared to at december   we had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  the increase is primarily a result of deductions taken by customers for programs  returns and other reasons  which we are in the process of reconciling and matching off against approved credits

the net income tax benefit was comprised of a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from decreases in deferred tax liabilities and partially offset by the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss and million of tax benefits primarily from the release of tax accruals 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was a million increased valuation allowance resulting from decreases in deferred tax liabilities because of a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance as the result of decreases in the deferred tax asset of million related to fixed assets  trade receivables  inventory and accrued expenses 
for  we recorded a net income tax provision of million  on a pre tax loss of million 
the net tax provision was comprised of a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities  partially offset by the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss and million of tax benefits primarily from the release of tax accruals 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings 
the recording of the new foreign tax credits was the result of a change in our intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future 
the valuation allowance was also increased as the result of a decrease in the deferred tax liability of million resulting from a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued the realizability of the net deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when we determine that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have recorded tax contingencies related to items in various countries  which are included in other accrued liabilities and in deferred income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets 
these reserve balances will be adjusted to the extent that these items are settled for amounts different than the amounts recorded 
the amount included in other accrued liabilities at december  and december  related to such tax contingencies was million and million  respectively 
we reversed a tax contingency of million in to the benefit provision for income taxes  due to the completion of a tax authority exam without adjustment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse

this asset has been entirely offset with a tax contingency reserve and therefore is presented as zero above 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets related to state nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future state tax deductions 
the difference in the amount of future federal and state tax deductions related to the nols is primarily attributable to two factors the difference between federal and state nol carryback rules which have allowed the use of federal nols in instances where state nols could not be utilized and the difference in the taxable portion for federal and state purposes of dividends received from our foreign subsidiary

see the discussion above entitled  dct program license agreement  impairment charges and related asset sales for more detail regarding the license agreement 
licensing is not a part of our major or central operations and thus the dct transaction was considered a gain rather than revenue 
since the license fees recaptured costs that resulted directly from our research and development activities  the license fees were considered to be a part of operations and thus were shown as a separate line item of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued bad debt the lower bad debt credit for resulted primarily from a large decrease in trade receivable balances in at december   we had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  interest income interest income of million during decreased million  or  compared to million for the million decrease in was due primarily from the lower cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances that resulted from the million one time cash dividend payment made on october  interest income was also impacted by lower interest rates for as compared to other income expense  net other net income of million increased million compared to other net expense of million in other net income was favorably impacted during primarily from the release of million of various accruals for a european subsidiary for which operations ceased in and from higher foreign currency gains of million 
during  other net expense included a million gain in europe for the release of specific value added taxes vat and customs accruals that were no longer needed 
income taxes for  we recorded a net income tax provision of million  on a pre tax loss of million 
the net tax provision was comprised of a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities  partially offset by the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss and million of tax benefits primarily from the release of tax accruals 
for  we recorded a net income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the net income tax benefit was comprised of the statutory tax benefit of million on the pre tax loss  a benefit of million for additional research tax credits and a net million of miscellaneous favorable tax adjustments  partially offset by a charge of million relating to an increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded a million increase in the valuation allowance resulting primarily from new foreign tax credit nols and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
included in the million increase in the valuation allowance was an million increased valuation allowance resulting from new foreign tax credits created by deemed swiss withholding taxes on foreign earnings 
the recording of the new foreign tax credits was the result of a change in our intention to repatriate foreign cash to the us in the form of dividends in the future 
the valuation allowance was also increased as the result of a decrease in the deferred tax liability of million resulting from a decrease in the pool of unrepatriated foreign earnings 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued we have recorded tax contingencies related to items in various countries  which are included in other accrued liabilities and in deferred income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount included in other accrued liabilities at december  related to such tax contingencies was million 
during  we reversed a tax contingency of million to the benefit provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations  due to changes in estimates about the future requirement of these reserves 
on april   in conjunction with releasing our first quarter pre tax results  we announced that we were conducting an analysis of our net tax assets and associated valuation reserves 
at the completion of the analysis  we concluded that foreign withholding taxes which were previously presented as income taxes receivable should be reclassified and reported as deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount reclassified on our december  consolidated balance sheet was million 
we also determined that an additional balance sheet reclassification of million was necessary to reclassify certain other accrued liabilities to current deferred income taxes 
we further concluded that no net adjustment was required to the fourth quarter tax provision because of certain fourth quarter offsetting adjustments related  in part  to the tax consequences of a million intercompany dividend required to fund the one time per share cash dividend paid to shareholders on october  we also concluded that no adjustments to the tax provisions were required in any other prior period 
during  we established an additional valuation allowance totaling million for a portion of our us deferred tax assets primarily related to state nols 
after considering our forecasts of taxable income in conjunction with other positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we concluded that a partial valuation allowance should be recorded against the net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured by applying the enacted tax rates and laws in effect for the years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
the following table summarizes us and foreign loss and tax credit carry forwards at december  amount expiration dates in thousands us and foreign loss deferred tax assets federal nols  to state nols  to foreign nols  to indefinite capital losses tax credit deferred tax assets foreign tax credits  to indefinite research credits  to alternative minimum tax credits  indefinite 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as compared to continued at december   we had million of deferred tax assets related to us federal net nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future us federal tax deductions 
at december   we had million of deferred tax assets related to state nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future state tax deductions 
the difference in the amount of future federal and state tax deductions related to the nols is primarily attributable to two factors the difference between federal and state nol carryback rules which have allowed the use of federal nols in instances where state nols could not be utilized and the difference in the taxable portion for federal and state purposes of dividends received from our foreign subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources detail of our total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and temporary investments are shown in the table below 
december  change change in thousands  except total cash and cash equivalents for the us entity total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and temporary investments for non us entities total consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and temporary investments working capital the repatriation of any of the million of foreign cash to the us will be taxable income in the us for federal and state tax purposes at a rate of approximately  unless the cash is repatriated at a lower rate under the ajca 
in any event  the amount of cash required for us federal and state taxes will be less than our effective tax rate due to the availability of existing federal and state nols and tax credit carry forwards 
the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from lower cash and cash equivalents  lower current deferred income taxes  lower inventories  lower trade receivables and lower other current assets  partially offset by lower other accrued liabilities 
the primary uses of cash from operations in were operating losses and million for restructuring disbursements 
these items were partially offset by the million of cash proceeds from the sale of our ownership in bytetaxi  inc 
table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued trade receivables decreased in primarily from lower sales 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables increased from days at december  to days at december   primarily due to the later timing of sales during the fourth quarter of dso is calculated by multiplying the period end trade receivables balance by and dividing that amount by the sales for the quarter ended of the applicable year 
current deferred income taxes decreased primarily due to lower current asset reserves and an increased valuation allowance primarily resulting from new foreign tax credits and decreases in deferred tax liabilities 
inventories decreased during primarily due to lower levels of nas and rev inventories  partially offsetby higher css inventory levels 
other current assets decreased due to lower prepayments associated with inventory owned by suppliers 
other current liabilities decreased primarily from lower accrued marketing expenses  accrued royalties and accrued payroll  vacation and bonus accruals 
accrued payroll  vacation and bonus accruals decreased primarily from the lower headcounts resulting from the restructuring actions and from minimal bonus accruals at december  it is our goal to reverse the negative cash flows from operations through completing the implementation of the restructuring actions and containing operating expense spending  growing rev product sales  improving the gross margins of hdd products and managing the zip products business for cash flow 
however  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of these goals 
during  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
at december   approximately million remained available for future repurchases under the million stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors on september  the repurchase plan does not have a fixed termination date 
we believe that our balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from future operations  will be sufficient to fund anticipated working capital requirements  funding of restructuring actions  capital expenditures and cash required for other activities for at least one year 
however  cash flow from future operations  investing activities  and the precise amount and timing of our future financing needs cannot be determined 
future cash flow will depend on a number of factors  including those set forth in the section labeled risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
should we be unable to meet our cash needs from our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and future cash flows from operations  we would most likely incur additional restructuring charges to adjust our expenditures to a level that our cash flows could support and or seek financing from other sources 
our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is our sole source of liquidity 
given our history of sales declines and losses  there is no assurance that  if needed  we would be able to obtain financing from external sources or obtain a competitive interest rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various interest rate risks including foreign currency  interest rate and securities price risks 
we are exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
we have international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from our functional currency 
we attempt to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
we use forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  we are using only forward contract instruments to hedge our net balance sheet exposures 
the contracts are in european currencies 
we enter into contracts throughout the month as necessary 
these contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed days 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period that the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the fair value of our forward contracts is subject to change because of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million at december  and million at december  however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges and consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and our ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedges 

table of contents iomega corporation and subsidiaries quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued we did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  and december  should we need to borrow funds in the future  we would be subject to credit based interest rate risks 
we are also subject to interest rate risks on our current cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
for example  if the interest rate on our interest bearing investments were to change basis points  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during and million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or our response to such hypothetical conditions 
investments purchased with maturities in excess of three months are classified as temporary investments 
none of our temporary investments have an effective maturity greater than months and at december   the average duration of our temporary investments was less than months  as compared to less than months at december  at december   we had debt security investments of million that will mature within one year and million that will mature in more than one year but less than two years 
we seek to minimize our credit risk associated with temporary investments by purchasing investment grade  liquid securities 
we have classified all of our temporary investments as available for sale securities
