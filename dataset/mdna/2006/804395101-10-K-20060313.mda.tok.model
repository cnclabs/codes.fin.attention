historical results set forth in selected financial information  the financial statements and supplemental data included in item and item and this section should not be taken as indicative of the company s future operations 
overview the company s principal business activity is the ownership  management and development of income producing properties 
the company s long term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate 
the company s primary operating strategy is to focus on its community and neighborhood shopping center business and to operate its properties to achieve both cash flow growth and capital appreciation 
management believes there is potential for growth in cash flow as existing leases for space in the shopping centers expire and are renewed  or newly available or vacant space is leased 
the company intends to renegotiate leases where possible and seek new tenants for available space in order to maximize this potential for increased cash flow 
as leases expire  management expects to revise rental rates  lease terms and conditions  relocate existing tenants  reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goal of increasing cash flow 
in those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring  management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means  or in connection with renovations or relocations  recapturing leases with below market rents and re leasing at market rates  as well as replacing financially troubled tenants 
when possible  management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent  as well as percentage rental provisions  in its leases 
the company s redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties  by replacing leases with below market rents with strong  traffic generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores  as well as other desirable local  regional and national tenants 
the company s strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing shopping centers  while enhancing this growth with selective retail redevelopments and renovations 
management believes that attractive acquisition and development opportunities for investment in existing and new shopping center properties will continue to be available from time to time 
management believes that the company s capital structure will enable it to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise 
in addition  management believes its shopping center expertise should permit it to optimize the performance of shopping centers once they have been acquired 
management also believes that opportunities may arise for investment in new office properties 
it is management s view that several of the office sub markets in which the company operates have attractive supply demand characteristics 
the company will continue to evaluate new office development and redevelopment as an integral part of its overall business plan 

table of contents although it is management s present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and office properties in the washington  dc baltimore metropolitan area and the southeastern region of the united states  the company may  in the future  also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves 
while the company may diversify in terms of property locations  size and market  the company does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of company assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area 
in addition to investing in properties in the washington  dc baltimore metropolitan area  during and  the company also acquired four grocery anchored neighborhood shopping centers in florida  totaling  square feet and another grocery anchored neighborhood shopping centers in georgia totaling  square feet 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the company s financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies which the company considers critical in that they may require judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
additional discussion of accounting policies which the company considers significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
real estate investments real estate investment properties are stated at historic cost basis less depreciation 
management believes that these assets have generally appreciated in value and  accordingly  the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the company s liabilities as reported in these financial statements 
because these financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  they do not report the current value of the company s real estate assets 
the purchase price of real estate assets acquired is allocated between land  building and in place acquired leases based on the relative fair values of the components at the date of acquisition 
buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
intangibles associated with acquired in place leases are amortized over the remaining base lease terms 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a real estate investment property  the company assesses an impairment in value by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of that property 
if such carrying amount is greater than the estimated projected cash flows  the company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
when incurred  the company capitalizes the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property and equipment and all repair and maintenance expenditures are expensed 
in addition  we capitalize leasehold improvements when certain criteria are met  including when we supervise construction and will own the improvement 

table of contents interest  real estate taxes and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction 
once construction is substantially complete and the assets are placed in service  rental income  direct operating expenses  and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations 
in the initial rental operations of development projects  a project is considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity 
substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method and estimated useful lives of to years for base buildings and up to years for certain other improvements 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the related leases using the straight line method 
lease acquisition costs certain initial direct costs incurred by the company in negotiating and consummating successful leases are capitalized and amortized over the initial base term of the leases 
capitalized leasing costs consist of commissions paid to third party leasing agents as well as internal direct costs such as employee compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing leasing related activities 
such activities include evaluating prospective tenants financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees  collateral and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing lease documents and closing transactions 
revenue recognition rental and interest income is accrued as earned except when doubt exists as to collectibility  in which case the accrual is discontinued 
recognition of rental income commences when control of the space has been given to the tenant 
when rental payments due under leases vary from a straight line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases  income is recognized on a straight line basis throughout the initial term of the lease 
expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to tenants  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs 
expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred 
rental income based on a tenant s revenues  known as percentage rent  is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint 
allowance for doubtful accounts current and deferred receivables accounts receivable primarily represent amounts accrued and unpaid from tenants in accordance with the terms of the respective leases  subject to the company s revenue recognition policy 
receivables are reviewed monthly and reserves are established with a charge to current period operations when  in the opinion of management  collection of the receivable is doubtful 
in addition to rents due currently  accounts receivable include amounts representing minimum rental income accrued on a straight line basis to be paid by tenants over the remaining term of their respective leases 
reserves are established with a charge to income for tenants whose rent payment history or financial condition casts doubt upon the tenant s ability to perform under its lease obligations 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are generally covered by insurance 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  the company believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations 
once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine 

table of contents results of operations revenue dollars in thousands for the year ended december  percentage change to to revenue base rent expense recoveries percentage rent other total total revenue increased for the year compared to primarily due to the contribution of operating revenue from three development properties shops at monocacy  kentlands place and broadlands ii and three acquisition properties palm springs  jamestown place and seabreeze plaza placed in service during and four operating properties acquired during the first half of  boca valley plaza  countryside  cruse marketplace and briggs chaney marketplace together defined as the development and acquisition properties whose operating results are included in s operating income but not fully in the previous year s results and the payment related to resolution of a land use dispute with a property owner adjacent to the company s lexington mall

percentage rent percentage rent is rental revenue calculated on the portion of a tenant s sales revenue that exceeds a specified breakpoint 
the majority of the  versus increase in percentage rents resulted from improved sales reported by a restaurant tenant at pennsylvania avenue or approximately 
additionally  percentage rent was positively impacted by two tenants at southdale  one paying percentage rent for the first time and the other reporting improved sales together  or approximately 
smaller percentage rent increases were recognized at several of the company s properties due to increased sales reported by selected tenants at those properties 
percentage rent decreased  for versus due to a change in major tenant s sales reporting procedures 
in years prior to  the tenant voluntarily provided interim sales reports upon which the company had based its calculations 
the tenant has indicated that going forward  it will only provide required annual sales reports per the terms of its lease agreement 
accounting rules prohibit the accrual of percentage rent until the tenant actually reports sales 
therefore the tenant s sales reporting change impacts only the timing of when the company recognizes percentage rent 
the company recognized percentage rent for this tenant during the second quarter of year other revenue other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue at three of the office properties  kiosk leasing  temporary leases and payments associated with early termination of leases and interest income from the investment of cash balances

also contributing to the other revenue increase was the collection of a lease termination fee and settlement of a rent dispute with two former tenants at pennsylvania avenue or 
the other revenue increases were offset in part by reduced parking revenue in the office portfolio or  primarily at pennsylvania avenue where parking spaces were temporarily placed out of service while the parking deck was being refurbished  and lower overall lease termination fees received in compared to the  decrease in other income for versus resulted primarily from a  decrease in lease termination fees from  in to  in  which was partially offset by an increase in parking income at the office properties of  and an increase in cash investment income of  in

impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of the company s portfolio  however  substantially all of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s results of operations

substantially all of the company s properties are leased to tenants under long term leases  which provide for reimbursement of operating expenses by tenants
