item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share data 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the financial condition and results of operations of national bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries and other information included in this report 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
the company uses historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in the loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the transactions could change 
allowance for the loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair market value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized either in the formula or in the specific allowance 
core deposit intangibles effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  statement requires that acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles be separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over its estimated useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of the statement and therefore any intangible asset arising from such transactions remained subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
the statement amends previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
the provisions of the statement do not apply to transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
in addition  the statement amends statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  to include in its scope core deposit intangibles of financial institutions 
accordingly  such intangibles are subject to a recoverability test based on undiscounted cash flows  and to the impairment recognition and measurement provisions required for other long lived assets held and used 
the company has determined that the acquisitions that generated the intangible assets and goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  did not constitute the acquisition of a business  and therefore will continue to be amortized 
overview national bankshares  inc nbi is a financial holding company  as defined in the gramm leach bliley act of located in southwest virginia  it conducts operations primarily through two full service banking affiliates  the national bank of blacksburg nbb and bank of tazewell county btc 
the banks are best characterized as community banks 
it also has one nonbanking affiliate  national bankshares financial services  inc nbfs  which offers investment and insurance products 
revenues and net income derived from the nonbanking affiliate are not significant at this time  nor are they expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
performance summary the following table shows nbi s key performance ratios for the period ended december  and return on average assets return on average equity basic net earnings per share fully diluted net earnings per share net interest margin noninterest margin net interest margin year to date tax equivalent net interest income divided by year to date average earning assets 
noninterest margin noninterest income excluding securities gain and losses less noninterest expense excluding the provision for bad debts and income taxes divided by average year to date assets 
as can be seen from the above data  the company s performance remains satisfactory though below levels 
while the return on average assets and equity experienced slight declines  basic earnings per share increased by 
return on average assets declined slightly because total assets in grew from acquisitions and internally generated growth at a faster rate than net earnings 
return on average equity was down from because the company s equity  generally from retained earnings  increased at a faster rate than the current year s net earnings 
basic income per share increased by because net earnings were higher than in and the number of shares of stock outstanding was slightly less than last year 
the net interest margin for was  which compares to for the decline experienced in was almost exclusively due to an increase in funding costs 
the noninterest margin declined by basis points 
growth the following table shows nbi s key growth indicators for the period ending securities   loans  net   deposits   total assets   total assets at december  were  an increase of  or 
loans net of unearned income and deferred fees increased  or 
total deposits at period end were  an increase of  or the above data reflects approximately  in loans and approximately  in deposits related to the acquisition of two branch facilities in the first quarter of asset quality key asset quality indicators are shown below nonperforming loans loans past due over days other real estate owned allowance for loan losses to loans net charge off ratio 

asset quality remains satisfactory as shown by the above data 
other real estate owned  in particular  has declined substantially 
the provision for loan losses for was  as compared with  in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans was at december  and at december  the decline in the provision and the related decline in the ratios of the allowance for loan losses to loans were justified by the improved quality of the subsidiary bank loan portfolios 
net interest income vs net interest income for the period ended december   was  an increase of or over a larger volume of loans was the primary source of the increase in interest income  and rising interest rates resulted in higher interest expense 
this is illustrated in the table  analysis of changes in interest income and expense  and is also shown by an examination of the various components of the net interest margin 
the first component of net interest income  the yield of earning assets  was at in  a basis point increase over since the yield on earning assets was largely unchanged between and  it follows that most of the  increase in interest income came from a higher volume of interest earning assets  particularly in the loan category 
the second component of net interest income is the cost to fund earning assets 
the cost to fund earning assets increased from in to in approximately  of the  increase was the result of higher interest rates 
the net effect of these factors was a basis point decline in the net interest margin 
management anticipates that funding costs will continue to rise in first  it is expected that the federal reserve bank will continue its current pattern of regular interest rate increases into the first half of the federal reserve bank has articulated a policy of increasing interest rates to a level that neither stimulates nor inhibits the economy 
should economic factors such as rising oil prices result in higher inflation  management believes that the federal reserve bank would respond with additional increases 
in management s opinion  prospects of higher inflation are uncertain and any increases in interest rates would  in the intermediate term  have a negative effect on the company s net interest income 
in addition  management believes a second factor will very likely cause funding costs to rise during as time deposits mature  they will be reinvested at a higher rate of interest 
therefore  for some period of time after the federal reserve bank stabilizes interest rates  the company s interest expenses will be expected to increase 
vs net interest income for the period ended december  was  an increase of  or over the net interest margin was for the period ended december  and for the period ended december  during the past two years the company has benefited from a relatively long period of low interest rates  which has no recent precedent 
the trend continued into the first half of in june of  the federal reserve board raised the federal funds rate basis points  signaling the start of a higher interest rate environment 
since then additional rate increases have occurred  with more expected 
many forecasters agree that interest rates will trend upward in small increments 
however  the impact of other events  such as  but not limited to  oil prices  problems in the middle east and terrorist related activities  could negatively impact the national economy and alter plans for future interest rate increases 
if such events were to occur  the company  together with the entire banking industry  could be affected to some extent 
the general impact of a rising interest rate scenario on the company s balance sheet follows 
federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits these are overnight funds used primarily for liquidity purposes 
they mature daily and  accordingly  interest rates change daily  which is advantageous in a period of rising interest rates 
however these funds yield low interest  making other investments more attractive from an earnings standpoint 
securities available for sale this category provides a higher level of earnings than overnight funds 
it can  under certain circumstances  be a source of liquidity  and it also demonstrates the ability to re price 
while these securities can be sold to provide liquidity and for interest rate sensitivity purposes  temporary declines in fair market value due to rising interest rates may make it unprofitable to sell the securities 
in addition  embedded call features may not be activated during periods of high rates  leaving the company with a hold or sell decision 
securities held to maturity because of its nature  this category of investments is not structured to be a source of liquidity or to moderate interest rate sensitivity 
these securities must be held to maturity except under extenuating circumstances 
in a rising rate environment  the difference in the amount of interest income earned and the cost to fund the securities decreases 
in other words  net interest income from these investments declines 
embedded call features may not be activated during periods of high rates 
mortgage loans held for sale this category is primarily driven by volume 
in periods of low interest rates  mortgage refinancing activity and home sales tend to accelerate and generate higher revenue levels than are experienced in times of high interest rates 
in the last two years  re financing activity has been significant 
recently  however  despite the continuing low rate environment  activity has declined 
loans while the low rate environment of the recent past is more conducive to loan production than periods of high interest rates  interest rates that are unusually low are a sign of a weak or a recovering economy 
ideal volumes may in fact be achieved in a more robust economy in which more moderate rate levels exist 
if the economy continues to recover as forecast  higher loan volumes would have a positive impact on net interest income 
of particular concern is the area of loans to individuals  which has been in a downward trend for several quarters  with the only growth coming from loans acquired in purchase and assumption transactions 
management believes the decline is due to several reasons 
o general economic conditions and the lack of employment in portions of the company s market area 
o a decline in consumer requests for new car financing because of special incentives offered by automobile companies 
o consumers use of credit cards and home equity lines with higher credit limits 
o consumers taking advantage of low mortgage rates to refinance home mortgages to obtain funds that might otherwise have been borrowed through a consumer loan 
a reversal of this trend may occur to some extent as economic conditions change and higher interest rates make mortgage refinancing less appealing 
however  management believes that the automotive related financing offers and competition from the credit card sector will remain 
since loans to individuals are generally higher yielding  this trend will not have a favorable effect on net interest income 
deposit expense vs as previously noted in the discussion of net interest income  funding costs are expected to rise in see the discussion of net interest income for further comments 
vs during periods of rising interest rates  interest bearing demand deposits  and to a lesser degree savings deposits  migrate to higher rate  longer term time deposits 
generally  as rates climb  more migration occurs 
given their re pricing characteristics  interest bearing demand deposits readily respond to any interest rate movement 
in other words  increases or decreases in interest expense can occur quite quickly 
with a definite bias towards higher interest rates in the future  it is expected that the net interest margin will decline  at least temporarily  in response to rising interest rates 
as previously stated  the ultimate impact of rising interest rates is dependent upon the number of rate increases  the amount of the increases and the level to which interest rates ultimately rise 
analysis of net interest earnings the following table shows the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest earned or paid  the average yield or rate on the daily average balance outstanding  net interest income and net yield on average interest earning assets for the years indicated

analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other funds 
the company s net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average asset and liability balances volume and changes in average interest rates rate

interest rate sensitivity vs the company considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analyses provides management with information related to repricing opportunities  while interest rate shock simulations indicate potential economic loss due to future interest rate changes 
risk factors and forward looking statements previously discussed under net interest income apply 
as previously stated  the company uses simulation analysis to forecast its balance sheet and monitor interest rate sensitivity 
one test is a shock analysis that measures the effect of a hypothetical  immediate and parallel shift in interest rates 
the following table shows the results of a rate shock and the effects on net income and return on average assets and return on average equity projected at december  for purposes of this analysis noninterest income and expenses are assumed to be flat 
in thousands  except for percent data rate shift bp return on average assets return on average equity simulation analysis allows the company to test asset and liability management strategies under rising and falling rate conditions 
as a part of the simulation process  certain estimates and assumptions must be made 
these include  but are not limited to  asset growth  the mix of assets and liabilities  rate environment and local and national economic conditions 
asset growth and the mix of assets can  to a degree  be influenced by management 
other areas  such as the rate environment and economic factors  cannot be controlled 
for this reason actual results may vary materially from any particular forecast or shock analysis 
this shortcoming is offset somewhat by the periodic reforecasting of the balance sheet to reflect current trends and economic conditions 
shock analysis must also be updated periodically as a part of the asset and liability management process 
vs the company considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk and has systems in place to measure the exposure of net interest income and fair market values to movement in interest rates

several types of charges imposed on demand deposit accounts  interest bearing deposit accounts and savings deposit accounts are included in this category  such as monthly fees on demand deposit accounts  charges for overdrafts and returned checks and atm fees 
the level of these types of charges can be affected by internal growth  acquisitions and by changes in fee schedules 
the modest increase in was the result of both internal growth and the acquisition of two branches  with approximately being attributable to acquisitions and the balance attributable to internal growth 
there were no significant changes to the structure of service charges during the year 
other service charges and fees were for the period ended december  this represents an increase of or over the previous year 
included in this category are a variety of fees  such as fees for the issuance of official checks  safe deposit box rent  income from the sale of checks to customers and commissions earned on the sale of credit life  accident and health insurance 
the level of income derived from these various types of fees varies 
fees for official checks and income from the sale of customer checks grow as new offices and new customers are added 
the most significant increases in safe deposit box rent also come with new offices 
changes in fee schedules generally do not have a discernable impact on the level of fees 
income derived from the sale of credit life  accident and health insurance varies with loan volume 
in  of the increase in other service charges and fees was attributable to commissions from the sale of credit life  accident and health insurance 
credit card fees for the period ended december  were  an increase of or over the previous year 
credit card transaction fees  debit card transaction fees and merchant fees are included in this category 
growth in the number of credit and debit card accounts results in higher fee income 
merchant fees also depend on the number of businesses using the company s program  as well as the type of business and level of transactions 
internal growth caused the increase in credit card fee income 
for the year ended december   trust income was  as compared with  in trust income is generated by a number of sources  including estates  personal trusts  employee benefit trusts  investment management accounts  attorney in fact accounts and guardianships 
trust income is dependent upon market conditions and the number and type of accounts being managed 
trust account values are affected by financial market conditions and this leads to fluctuations in trust income 
for  trust income declined by when compared with income from estates was off by from  and income from attorney in fact accounts declined by there was an increase of in custodial account income  and income from other types of accounts grew by when compared with other types of income that cannot be included in the categories listed above is classified as other income 
examples are net gains on the sale of fixed assets  rent on foreclosed properties  income from increases in the cash value of life insurance and revenue from the sale of investments and insurance 
when and are compared  the other income category  which was at december   increased by or 
with increased investment and insurance sales  the company s nonblank subsidiary  national bankshares financial services  inc  was responsible for of the increase in other income in realized gains of in securities matured or sold were totally offset by realized losses of an equal amount in vs noninterest income is comprised of several categories 
following is a description of each  as well as the factors that influence each 
service charges on deposit accounts consist of a variety of charges imposed on demand deposits  interest bearing deposits and savings deposit accounts 
these include  but are not limited to  the following o demand deposit monthly activity fees o service charges for checks for which there are non sufficient funds or overdraft charges o atm transaction fees the principal factors affecting current or future income are o internally generated growth o acquisitions of other banks branches or de novo branches o adjustments to service charge structures in  the company made certain changes to its service charge structure 
these changes were not in effect in the first quarter of the remainder of the increase was due to volume  combined with routine charge offs 
revenues are expected to continue to grow if  for no other reason  than the two recent acquisitions 
see the comments under acquisitions 
other service charges and fees consist of several categories 
the primary categories are listed below 
o fees for the issuance of official checks o safe deposit box rent o income from the sale of customer checks o income from the sale of credit life and accident and health insurance levels of income derived from these categories vary 
fees for the issuance of official checks and customer check sales tend to grow as the existing franchise grows and as new offices are added 
fee schedules  while subject to change  generally do not alone yield a significant or discernable increase in income when adjusted 
the most significant growth in safe deposit box rent also comes with an expansion of offices 
safe deposit box fee schedules  which are already at competitive levels  are occasionally adjusted 
income derived from the sale of credit life insurance and accident and health insurance varies with loan volumes 
credit card fees consist of three types of revenues as follows o credit card transaction fees o debit card transaction fees o merchant fees in all three cases  volume is critical to growth in income 
for debit and credit cards the number of accounts  whether obtained from internal growth or by acquisition  is the key factor 
merchant fees also depend on the number of merchants in the company s program  as well as the type of business and the level of transaction discounts associated with them 
trust income is somewhat dependent upon market conditions and the number of estate accounts being handled at any given point in time 
financial market conditions  which affect the value of trust assets managed  can vary  leading to fluctuations in the related income 
over the past few years and into  the financial markets have experienced a significant degree of volatility 
of the increase  approximately was attributable to income from the settlement of estates 
improvement in market conditions accounts for the majority of the remaining increase 
the other income category is used for types of income that cannot be classified with other forms of noninterest income 
the category includes such things as o net gains on the sale of fixed assets o rent on foreclosed property o income from cash value life insurance o other infrequent or minor forms of income o revenue from investment and insurance sales given the nature of the items included in this category  it is difficult to determine trends or patterns 
items warranting discussion are usually non recurring in nature 
net realized gains on securities at december  were and were the results of called or sold securities  offset by write downs in certain equity securities 
noninterest expense vs december  december  december  salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and furniture and    fixtures data processing and atm    credit card processing    intangibles and goodwill  amortization net costs of other real estate owned other operating expenses    from december  to december   salary and benefits expense increased by or to  approximately of the year over year increase was attributable to the addition of a number of employees from acquisitions in mid and early higher pension costs accounted for of the increase  and health insurance premiums added to the category 
routine merit salary increases averaging accounted for the remainder of the growth in salary and benefits expense 
occupancy and furniture and fixtures expense was  for the period ended december  this represents an increase of or 
occupancy expense includes items such as depreciation expense  maintenance and repairs and real estate taxes 
this category of expense can be affected by acquiring new property as a result of the construction of new offices and additions to existing offices or through merger or purchases of banks or single or multiple office locations 
conversely  occupancy and furniture and fixture expense can decline with the consolidation  closure or sale of branch offices 
for  the costs for the installation of a new company wide telephone system and for fixed assets purchased in the branch office acquisition contributed to the year over year increase 
for  data processing and atm expense grew by or over included in the total was approximately in expenses attributable to the first quarter conversion of the computer system of community national bank  acquired in servicing fees to community national bank s data processor were approximately to the point of conversion 
credit card processing expense was  for the period ended december   an increase of or over these expenses are volume driven and are directly related to the level of credit card fees 
comments in that section of the discussion of noninterest income apply 
there was an increase of or in intangible and goodwill expense when and are compared  with a total of  for this category of noninterest expense is related to acquisitions  and  as noted above  the company acquired two branch offices in early in addition  expenses associated with the branch office and bank acquisitions  which occurred at different times during  did not impact intangible and goodwill expense for the full calendar year  but they were included for the entire year in net costs of other real estate owned were for  an increase of when compared with these costs are related to the write down and liquidation of foreclosed properties 
this year s expenses are higher than in because of the disposition of a greater number of foreclosed properties 
there has been an improvement in the amount of foreclosed property during  and the table which follows under risk elements illustrates this 
other operating costs for the period ended december  were  up by or over the same period in the increase was nominal 
franchise taxes  stationery and supplies  telephone costs  postage and charitable donations are examples of other operating costs 
vs noninterest expense includes several categories 
following is a brief description of the factors that affect each 
in addition to employee salaries  the salaries and benefits expense category includes the costs of employment taxes and employee fringe benefits 
certain of these are o health insurance o employee life insurance o dental insurance o executive compensation plans o pension plans o employee stock option plan o employer fica o unemployment taxes see the proxy statement for the annual stockholders meeting for further information 
for  salary and benefits expense was up or 
routine salary increases and health insurance cost increases contributed to the increase 
of more significance were the purchase and assumption transactions 
while the fnb se branch acquisition added no employees to the payroll  the cnb purchase and assumption initially added twenty one employees 
because the company s nbb subsidiary is operating the former cnb office as a branch office  many former cnb employees were retained in their previous positions 
some former cnb employees hold jobs that are performed elsewhere at nbb and they have moved to those positions as the need arose 
occupancy costs include such items as depreciation expense  maintenance of the properties  repairs and real estate taxes 
this category is most affected by new property acquisitions resulting from mergers  branch purchases or construction of new branch facilities 
conversely  expense can be lowered by branch office consolidations or closures  which though infrequent  have occurred 
on occasion  repairs and other expense items can rise to significant levels  though not frequently 
this category increased when and are compared 
new branches  renovation and acquisitions also create increases in the area 
the company maintains its own data processing facility and has atm s at twenty four subsidiary bank offices and other locations 
costs to operate these are reflected in this category and include depreciation  maintenance  communication lines and certain supplies 
data processing costs were up when is compared to while these cost increases are nominal  larger increases are expected because of the completion of the two previously mentioned purchase and assumption transactions 
the first purchase and assumption transaction was quite small and has not greatly impacted data processing and atm expense 
the second acquisition involved the assets and liabilities of an existing bank  including assumption of its existing data processing contract  which will remain until mid assumption of this contract increased monthly costs by approximately while the contract terminates in mid  no substantial decreases in processing costs are expected  as the company s primary data processing contract allows for incremental increases 
the company also added three atm s at its bank affiliates during credit card processing includes costs associated with the processing of credit cards  debit cards and merchant transactions 
these expenses are related to credit card income previously discussed in the noninterest income section  and the comments in that section are applicable 
at december  the net costs of other real estate owned was expense has risen steadily for the past three years 
other real estate owned at december  was  which compares to  at december  and at december  other operating expenses include all other forms of expense not classified elsewhere in the company s statement of income 
included in this category are such items as stationery and supplies  franchise taxes  contributions  telephone  postage and other operating costs 
many of the expenses included in this category are relatively stable or moderately increase with inflation from year to year 
however  there are some items included in the category  such as other losses and charge offs and repossession expense  which can vary from time to time 
while many of the items in this category have identifiable trends  others may have frequent nonrecurring items or items that occur at no particular frequency 
this category was also affected by the recent acquisitions 
categories such as stationery and supplies  telephone  and postage all increase when new offices are acquired 
overall cost for this category increased  when the periods ending december  and december  are compared 
income taxes vs income tax expense for was  an increase of tax exempt income continues to be the primary difference between the expected and actual income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the company is subject to the marginal tax rate 
vs income tax expense for increased by when compared to tax exempt income was the primary difference between the expected and reported tax expense 
the company s effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the company is subject to the marginal tax rate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to income taxes 
effects of inflation the company s consolidated statements of income generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand  and deposit levels are related to inflation  the resulting changes are included in net income 
the most significant item which does not reflect the effects of inflation is depreciation expense 
historical dollar values used to determine depreciation expense do not reflect the effects of inflation on the market value of depreciable assets after their acquisition 
provision and allowance for loan losses vs the allowance for loan losses at december  was  a decrease from the same period ended december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at the end of was  which compares to last year 
the net charge off ratio at december  was  and it was at december  the company regularly reviews asset quality and re evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews are conducted of the status of the loan portfolios at each of the two bank subsidiaries  and an appropriate allowance for loan losses is established for each bank  depending upon factors that are unique to the bank and the quality of its loan portfolio 
as noted above  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans is lower than at the end of the ratio has declined as total loans have grown from  at december  to  at december   while the level of the allowance has remained relatively stable 
because of the continued excellent overall quality of the loan portfolio at one subsidiary bank and the improving quality of the loan portfolio at the second bank  it is management s judgment that the decrease in the provision for loan losses is justified and the allowance is appropriate and adequate 
see allowance for loan losses under critical accounting policies 
vs the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment and analysis of current and historical loss experience  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit and asset quality  as well as other internal and external factors  such as general economic conditions 
an internal credit review department performs pre credit analyses of large credits and also conducts credit review activities that provide management with an early warning of asset quality deterioration 
the internal credit review department also prepares regular analyses of the adequacy of the provision for loans losses 
these analyses include calculations based upon a mathematical formula that considers identified potential losses and makes pool allocations for historical losses for various loan types 
in addition  an amount is allocated based upon such factors as changing trends in the loan mix  the effects of changes in business conditions  the effects of any changes in loan policies  and the effects of competition and regulatory factors on the loan portfolio 
the internal credit review department has determined that the company s provision for loan losses is sufficient 
overall asset quality has improved in reference is made to data shown in the performance summary

management does not plan any future involvement in high risk derivative products 
the company has investments in mortgage backed securities  principally gnma s and fnma s  with a fair value of approximately  the company had no structured notes as of december  see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to securities 
the company s securities and loans are subject to credit and interest rate risk  and its deposits are subject to interest rate risk 
management considers credit risk when a loan is granted and monitors credit risk after the loan is granted 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses in the collection of its loans 
see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements for information relating to the allowance for loan losses 
see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements for information relating to concentrations of credit risk 
the company has an asset liability program to manage its interest rate risk 
this program provides management with information related to the rate sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the effect of changing rates on profitability and capital accounts 
the effects of changing interest rates are primarily managed through adjustments to the loan portfolio and deposit base  to the extent competitive factors allow 
the investment portfolio is generally longer term 
adjustments for asset and liability management concerns are addressed when securities are called or mature and funds are subsequently reinvested 
historically  sales of securities have occurred for reasons related to credit quality or regulatory limitations 
few  if any  securities available for sale have been disposed of for the express purpose of managing interest rate risk 
no trading activity for this purpose is planned for the foreseeable future  though it does remain an option 
while this planning process is designed to protect the company over the long term  it does not provide near term protection from interest rate shocks  as interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not  by their nature  move up or down in tandem in response to changes in the overall rate environment 
the company s profitability in the near term may be temporarily affected either positively by a falling interest rate scenario or negatively by a period of rising rates
