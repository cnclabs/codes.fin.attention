risk factors 
cautionary statements the value of an investment in the company involves significant risks and uncertainties 
the following cautionary statements and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our growth is dependent on our ability to execute our expansion strategy 
our growth strategy is dependent principally on our ability to open new stores and remodel  expand and or relocate certain of our existing stores and operate them profitably 
in general  the rate of our expansion depends  among other things  on general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending  the availability of qualified management personnel and our ability to manage the operational aspects of our growth 
it also depends upon the availability of adequate capital  which in turn depends in a large part upon the cash flow generated from operations 
our future results will depend  among other things  on the success in implementing our expansion strategy 
if stores are opened more slowly than expected  sales at new stores reach targeted levels more slowly than expected or fail to reach targeted levels or related overhead costs increase in excess of expected levels  our ability to successfully implement our expansion strategy would be adversely affected 
our business is dependent upon renewing or entering into new leases on favorable terms 
all of the company s stores are located in leased premises 
if the cost of leasing existing stores increases  the company cannot assure that it will be able to maintain its existing store locations as leases expire 
in addition  the company may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all  or it may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner 
the company s revenues and earnings may decline if the company fails to maintain existing store locations  enter into new leases  locate alternative sites or find additional sites for new expansion 

table of contents our business is highly seasonal 
as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater portion of our operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of our annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
less than satisfactory net sales for such period could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations for the year and may not be sufficient to cover any losses that may have been incurred in the first three quarters of the year 
we experience reduced rental activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of store openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and video titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect our operations 
intense competition from traditional retail sources and the internet may adversely affect our business 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
for all of our product categories  we compete directly with national store operators  as well as regional chains and stores  specialty retailers dealing in our products  independent single store operators  discount stores  warehouse and mail order clubs  and mass merchandisers 
in addition  the internet is a significant channel for retailing for most of the product categories that we offer 
in particular  the retailing of books  music and video over the internet is highly competitive 
in addition  we face competition from companies engaged in the business of selling books  music and movies and the renting of movies via electronic means  including the downloading of music content and in home video delivery 
an increase in competition in the physical or electronic markets in which we operate could have a material effect on our operations 
our business is dependent on consumer spending patterns 
revenues generated from the sale and rental of books  music  videos and other products we carry have historically been dependent upon discretionary consumer spending  which may be affected by general economic conditions  consumer confidence and other factors beyond our control 
a decline in consumer spending on the buying and or rental of the products we offer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fund our expansion strategy 
we rely on certain key personnel 
management believes that the company s continued success will depend  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of mr 
john h 
marmaduke  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
marmaduke could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we maintain a key man term life insurance policy on mr 
marmaduke for million 
in addition  our success depends  in part  on our ability to retain key management and attract other personnel to satisfy our current and future needs 
the inability to retain key management personnel or attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our business could be negatively impacted if the in store video retailer distribution window is reduced or eliminated 
a competitive advantage that in store video retailers currently enjoy over most other movie distribution channels  except theatrical release  is the early timing of the in store video retailer distribution window 
after the initial theatrical release of a movie  studios generally make their movies available to in store video retailers for rental and retail  including by mass merchant retailers for specified periods of time 
this distribution window is typically exclusive against most other forms of non theatrical movie distribution  such as pay per view  video on demand  premium television  basic cable and network and syndicated television 
the length of this exclusive distribution window for in store video retailers varies  but has traditionally ranged from to days for domestic video stores 
thereafter  movies are made sequentially available to television distribution channels 

table of contents our business could be negatively affected if i in store video retailer distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release  ii the length of the in store video retailer distribution windows were shortened  or iii the in store video retailer distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now because newly released movies would be made available earlier on these other forms of non theatrical movie distribution 
as a result  consumers would no longer need to wait until after the in store video retailer distribution window to view a newly released movie on these other distribution channels 
we believe that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable in store video retail industry 
however  the order  length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie  and we cannot predict future decisions by the studios  or the impact  if any  of those decisions 
in addition  any consolidation or vertical integration of media companies to include both content providers and digital distributors could pose a risk to the continuation of the distribution window 
our business is subject to changes in current rental video studio pricing policies 
recent studio pricing for movies released to in store video retailers has impacted our video business 
historically  studio pricing was based on whether or not a studio desired to promote a movie for both rental and sale to the consumer  or primarily for rental  from the beginning of the in store video distribution window 
in order to promote a movie title for rental  the title would be released to in store video retailers at a price that was too high to allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer at the beginning of the retail in store video distribution window 
as rental demand subsided  the studio would reduce pricing in order to then allow for reasonably priced sales to consumers 
currently  substantially all dvd titles are released at a price to the in store video retailer that is low enough to allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the retail in store video distribution window 
this low sell through pricing policy has led to increasing competition from other retailers  including mass merchants and online retailers  who are able to purchase dvds for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional in store video retailers  like hastings  which purchase both dvds and vhs product for rental 
in addition  some retailers sell movies at lower prices in order to increase overall traffic to their stores or businesses  and mass merchants may be more willing to sell at lower prices  and in some instances  below wholesale 
these factors have increased consumer interest in purchasing dvds  which has reduced the significance of the vhs rental window 
we believe that the increased consumer purchases are due in part to consumer interest in building dvd libraries of classic movies and personal favorites and that the studios will remain dependent on the traditional in store video retailer to generate revenues for the studios from titles that are not classics or current box office hits 
approximately of most studios revenues derive from their home entertainment divisions 
we therefore believe the importance of the video rental industry to the studios will continue to be a factor in studio pricing decisions 
however  we cannot control or predict studio pricing policies with certainty  and we cannot assure you that consumers will not  as a result of further decreases in studio sell through pricing and or sustained or further depressed pricing by competitors  increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies 
personal dvd libraries could also cause consumers to rent or purchase fewer movies in the future 
our profitability could therefore be negatively affected if  in light of any such consumer behavior  we were unable to i grow our rental business  ii replace gross profits from generally higher margin rentals with gross profits from increased sales of generally lower margin sell through product  or iii otherwise positively affect gross profits  such as through price increases or cost reductions 
our ability to achieve one or more of these objectives is subject to risks  including the risk that we may not be able to compete effectively with other dvd retailers  some of whom may have competitive advantages such as the pricing flexibility described above or favorable consumer perceptions regarding value 
regardless of the wholesale pricing environment  the extent of our profitability is dependent on our ability to enter into and maintain arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations 
each type of arrangement provides different advantages and challenges for us 
the ability to negotiate preferred terms under revenue sharing agreements for the procurement of dvd  video games and vhs titles is crucial to our operations 
our profitability could be negatively affected if studios were to make other changes in their wholesale pricing policies and revenue sharing agreements 

table of contents our business could be negatively impacted by new technology that provides alternate methods of video delivery 
advances in technologies such as video on demand or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery  could have a negative effect on our business 
in particular  our business could be impacted if i newly released movies were to be made widely available by the studios to these technologies at the same time or before they are made available to in store video retailers for rental  and ii these technologies were to be widely accepted by consumers 
in addition  advances in direct broadcast satellite and cable technologies may adversely affect public demand for video store rentals 
if direct broadcast satellite and digital cable were to become more widely available and accepted  this could cause a smaller number of movies to be rented if viewers were to favor the expanded number of conventional channels and expanded content  including movies  specialty programming and sporting events  offered through these services 
if this were to occur  it could have a negative effect on our video store business 
direct broadcast satellite providers transmit numerous channels of programs by satellite transmission into subscribers homes 
also  cable providers are taking advantage of digital technology to transmit many additional channels of television programs over cable lines to subscribers homes 
changes to information technology systems may disrupt the supply chain 
we use a number of computerized information systems to manage our new release allocations  selection management  merchandise planning  pricing  markdowns  and inventory replenishment at each store and at our distribution facility 
these major systems collectively support our supply chain 
through continuing processes of review and evaluation the company is implementing modifications  enhancements  and upgrades to its information technology systems 
in some cases these changes include replacing legacy systems with successor systems 
there are inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing these core systems  including timely accurate movement and processing of data  which could possibly result in supply chain disruptions 
we believe that the appropriate processes and procedures are in place through our software development life cycle sdlc  design  testing  and staging implementation  along with obtaining appropriate commercial contracts and application documentation with third party vendors supplying such replacement technologies 
there can be no assurances that we will successfully modify  integrate  or launch these new systems or changes as planned or that they will occur without supply chain or other disruptions or without impacts on inventory valuation 
these disruptions or impacts  if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated  could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that buys  sells  trades  and rents various home entertainment products  including books  music  software  periodicals  new and used dvds  video games and videocassettes  video game consoles and dvd players through its entertainment stores and its internet web site 
as of january   we operated stores averaging approximately  square feet in small to medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the stores is leased from a third party  wholly owned by us and operated under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing stores  opening new stores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value of merchandise inventory by product category and record an adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
through merchandising and an automated progressive markdown program  we quickly take the steps necessary to increase the sell off of slower moving merchandise to eliminate or lessen the effect of these adjustments 
returns process 
merchandise inventory owned by us is generally returnable based upon return agreements with our merchandise vendors 
we continually return merchandise to vendors based on  among other factors  current and projected sales trends  overstock situations  authorized return timelines or changes in product offerings 
at the end of any reporting period  cost accruals are required for inventory that has been returned to vendors  is in the process of being returned to vendors  or has been identified to be returned to vendors 
these costs can include freight  valuation and quantity differences  and other fees charged by a vendor 
in order to appropriately match the costs associated with the return of merchandise with the process of returning such merchandise  we utilize an allowance for cost of inventory returns 
to accrue for such costs and estimate this allowance  we utilize historical experience adjusted for significant estimated or contractual modifications 
certain adjustments to the allowance can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 

table of contents rental asset depreciation 
we have established depreciation policies with respect to our rental assets that allow for the matching of product costs with the related revenues 
these policies require that we make significant estimates based upon our experience as to the ultimate revenue and the timing of the revenue to be generated by our rental product 
we utilize an accelerated method of depreciation because it approximates the pattern of demand for the product  which is generally higher when the product is initially released for rental by the studios and declines over time 
in establishing residual values for our rental product  we consider the sales prices and volume of our previously rented product and other used product 
based upon these estimates  we currently depreciate the cost of our rental assets on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit for vhs units  except for rental assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are being depreciated on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of for vhs units 
rental assets purchased for less than established salvage values are not depreciated 
the costs of rental product purchased pursuant to revenue sharing arrangements typically include a lower initial product cost and a percentage of the net rental revenues to be shared with studios over an agreed period of time 
additionally  certain titles have performance guarantees 
any up front costs exceeding per unit for vhs units are amortized on an accelerated basis and revenue sharing payments pursuant to the applicable arrangement are expensed as the related revenue is earned 
the company analyzes titles that are subject to performance guarantees and recognizes an estimated expense for under performing titles throughout the applicable period based upon the company s analysis of the estimated shortfall 
the company revises these estimates on a monthly basis  according to actual results 
we also review the carrying value of our assets to ensure that estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying value 
we record adjustments to the value of previously rented product primarily for estimated obsolete or excess product based upon changes in our original assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional adjustments  including adjustments to useful lives or residual values  may be required 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and residual values used in depreciating our rental assets 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand  changes in our customer preferences or the price or availability of retail products may materially impact the carrying value of our rental assets and our rental margins 
store closing reserve 
on a quarterly basis  and in the normal course of business  we evaluate our store base to determine if we need to close or relocate a store s 
management will evaluate  among other factors  current and future profitability  market trends  age of store and lease status 
the primary expense items associated with the closure of a store relate to the net present value of minimum lease payments the present value of remaining lease payments under an active lease and the accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements and other assets not remaining in our possession 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize lease termination costs at the time the store is closed or relocated 
the amount recorded can fluctuate based on the age of the closing store  term and remaining years of the lease and the number of stores being closed or relocated 
we actively pursue sublease tenants on all closed or relocated stores and  as part of the final estimation of store closing liability  the impact of any sublease income is estimated 
the net of the described charges and sublease income estimates can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate poor performing stores on a quarterly basis to determine whether projected future cash flows over the remaining initial lease term are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the fixed asset investment in each individual store 
if projected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the fixed asset investment  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value is less than the fair value of such assets 
the carrying value of leasehold improvements as well as certain other property and equipment is subject to impairment write down 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from retail sales and rental of our products 
merchandise and rental revenues are recognized at the point of sale or rental or at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
revenues are presented net of estimated returns and exclude all taxes 
customers may return certain merchandise for exchange or refund within our policies  and an allowance has been established to provide for projected returns 
there are no provisions for uncollectible amounts since payment is received at the time of sale 
we  as with most retailers  also offer gift cards for sale 
deferred revenue  a current liability  is recognized at the time a gift card is sold with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as an expense as incurred 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved and revenue is recognized upon the redemption of the gift cards 
from time to time we will offer sales incentives to customers  in the form of rebates 
revenue is reduced by the amount of estimated redemptions  based on experience of similar types of rebate offers  and a deferred revenue liability is established 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved when the customer has completed all criteria necessary to file a valid rebate claim 
any remaining portion of deferred revenue is recorded as revenue following the termination of the extended redemption period and following completion of all outstanding rebate claims 
the company reduces its revenue and recognizes a reserve for the estimated utilization of early return credits received by renters for early return of rentals 
the liability is relieved upon the redemption of these early return credits 
additionally  we promote the exchange of multiple used products for new product by our customers 
comparable store revenue 
stores included in the comparable store revenues calculation are those stores that have been open for a minimum of weeks 
also included are stores that are remodeled or relocated 
sales via the internet are not included and closed stores are removed from each comparable period for the purpose of calculating comparable store revenues 
vendor allowances 
in  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller for various vendor funded allowances  including cooperative advertising support 
the eitf determined that cash consideration received from a vendor should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of vendor s products and  therefore  should be shown as a reduction in the cost of goods sold when recognized in the reseller s income statements 
the only exception to this rule is if the reimbursement is for specific  incremental identifiable costs 
if the amount of cash consideration received exceeds the cost being reimbursed  that excess amount should be characterized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when recognized in the reseller s income statements 
in accordance with eitf  a portion of our vendor advertising allowances have been recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventory and the cost of rental assets and will be recognized in cost of revenues as inventory is sold and as rental assets are rented 
certain amounts that we receive from vendors  such as cooperative advertising payments  are considered reimbursement for specific  identifiable costs and therefore continue to be recorded as a reduction of sg a

liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations exclusively from the sale of merchandise and the rental of products and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchase  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental products  opening new stores and expanding existing stores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments  except for the stock buyback programs more fully discussed below 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new stores and store expansions through fiscal historically we have experienced an increase in our debt level during the third quarter of our fiscal year 
for third quarter of fiscal  we are projecting our debt level to increase to approximately million to million 
however  we expect this balance to reduce to approximately million to million in the fourth quarter due to a higher level of repayments following the holiday selling season

capital structure 
on july  and february   we executed amendments to our syndicated secured loan and security agreement with fleet retail finance  inc and the cit group business credit  inc  the facility 
the amount outstanding under the facility is limited by a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory  as defined in the facility  and certain rental assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and after the february  amendment  is limited to a ceiling of million  less a million availability reserve 
the facility permits borrowings at various interest rate options based on the prime rate or london interbank offering rate libor plus applicable margin depending upon the level of our minimum availability 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental assets net of accumulated amortization less specifically defined reserves  which can be adjusted to reduce availability under the facility 
lenders may increase specifically defined reserves to reduce availability in the event of adverse changes in our industry that are projected to impact the value of our assets pledged as collateral 
the facility contains no financial covenants  restricts the payment of dividends and includes certain other debt and acquisition limitations  allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiaries and is guaranteed by each of our consolidated subsidiaries 
per the amendment executed on february   the facility matures on august  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
however  excess availability may be reduced in the future as changes in the borrowing base occur or the lenders increase availability reserves 
the average rate of interest being charged under the facility for fiscal years ending january  and was and  respectively 
we utilize standby letters of credit to support certain insurance policies 
the aggregate amount of the letters of credit at january  was approximately million  which reduces the excess availability under the facility 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate agreements with financial institutions in order to obtain a fixed interest rate on a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt  thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility 
on june   the company agreed to a two year interest rate cap agreement  expiring june   with a major bank to hedge million of the company s variable rate debt day libor against interest rate increases 
the bank will cap the company s interest rate at for the first million of outstanding debt over the next two years 
should the day libor rate remain at or lower  the interest rate cap will result in no settlement 
should the rate climb above during the term of the rate cap  the bank will settle with the company at the end of each month

the company designates this transaction as a 
table of contents hedge in accordance with sfas  which requires the effective portion of the hedge to be accounted for initially as a component of other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
subsequently  it will be reclassified into the earnings when the transaction affects earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is to be reported in earnings immediately 
at january   the company deemed the hedge to be fully effective 
for the fiscal year ended january   the company recognized approximately  net of tax  as other comprehensive income related to the hedge agreement 
at january   our minimum lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
the present value of total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through discounted at was approximately million as of january  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
current accounting standards require us to disclose our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements 
we disclose our contractual long term debt repayment and the principal portion of capital lease obligations in note and our current and future operating and capital lease payments in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we routinely enter into commitments for various aspects of our operations  such as warehouse and office equipment 
however  we do not believe that these commitments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   other than operating leases and standby letters of credit  we had not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or third party guarantees  nor is it our business practice to do so 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal only operating leases capital leases principal and interest revenue sharing total based on our internal forecasts  we estimate interest payments for fy to be approximately million 
as of january  we were a party to revenue sharing arrangements with various studios 
these agreements include minimum purchase requirements  based upon the box office results of the title  at a lower initial product cost as compared to non revenue sharing purchases 
in addition  these contracts require net rental revenues to be shared with the studios over an agreed period of time 
we have included amounts owed and an estimate of our contractual obligation under these agreements for performance guarantees and minimum purchase requirements for the period in which they can reasonably be estimated  which is approximately two months in the future 
although these contracts may extend beyond the estimated two month period  we cannot reasonably estimate these amounts due to the uncertainty of purchases that will be made under these agreements 
the amounts presented above do not include revenue sharing accruals for rental revenues recorded during fiscal 
table of contents seasonality and inflation our business is highly seasonal  with significantly higher revenues and operating income realized during the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday selling season

substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company has evaluated the provisions of sfas and does not anticipate that adoption will have an impact on its consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations  shareholders equity and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including stock options  at fair value 
the statement will be effective for public companies no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year commencing after june   which for the company is the beginning of fiscal the company plans to adopt the modified prospective method and is currently evaluating the effect that sfas r will have on its consolidated balance sheets and its statements of shareholders equity and cash flows 
the company believes the adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on results of operations  unless significant future stock grants occur 
sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions for the years ended january    and was not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt  after adjustment for the interest rate hedge agreement  would be approximately million 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year
