overview the consolidated financial statements present the financial condition of the company as of june  and  and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company for the years ended june   and the company designs  develops and markets microwave components and assemblies for the wireless communications  satellite communications and defense electronics markets 
the company s distinctive manufacturing and packaging techniques enable it to cost effectively produce compact  lightweight microwave products for use in base stations for wireless communications systems  in satellites and in defense electronics systems 
beginning in  the company has introduced new components addressing consumer wireless applications such as wireless local area networks  bluetooth  cellular handsets and satellite telecommunications 
the company sells its products to leading wireless communications equipment manufacturers such as ericsson  motorola  nokia  nortel networks  and andrew  and to satellite communications and defense electronics companies such as boeing satellite  itt  lockheed martin  northrup grumman and raytheon 
the company recognizes sales at the time products are shipped to customers  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or easily determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership of products are generally transferred at the time of shipment 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
annually  a small percentage of sales are derived from fixed price contracts for the sale of engineering design and development efforts for space and defense electronics products 
sales and estimated profits under development contracts are recognized according to customer contractual milestones on a units of delivery basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes in sales value and costs at completion 
any losses on these contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
on august   the company acquired a  square foot building situated on approximately acres in salem  new hampshire for a purchase price of million 
the company commenced the move of its amitron  inc subsidiary to the new facility in september and is operating the business under the name of anaren ceramics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company

the relocation of rf power s operation to the salem  new hampshire facility was completed during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of this consolidation  the company recognized costs of  for severance and outplacement expenses   for lease cancellation and  for additional inventory write downs during the second quarter of fiscal further consolidation costs totaling approximately  including equipment write downs of  were recognized in the third quarter of fiscal  related to integrating rf power s operation into anaren ceramics 
effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r 
this standard requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
these costs are to be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
sfas r provides for a prospective application for adoption which the company chose 
under this method  the company began recognizing compensation costs for stock option equity based compensation for all new or modified grants after june  and for the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards issued prior to adoption  based on the fair value previously calculated for footnote disclosure purposes 
equity based compensation cost for employee stock options recognized in the year ended june  was  the final liquidation and dissolution of the company s european corporate structure was concluded during the quarter ended march  as part of this liquidation and dissolution  the company recognized income from discontinued operations of  resulting from final asset and liability liquidation and previously unrecognized currency translation gains

net sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this rise in sales resulted from a million increase in sales of space and defense products in fiscal  while shipments of wireless products rose million for the same period 
sales of wireless products for fiscal were up million  or compared to fiscal during fiscal sales of new consumer products rose million  or  while sales of custom products  which are produced mainly in our china facility  increased million  or  and sales of standard surface mount components rose million  or compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decline in combined circulator and resistive products sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a decline in demand for these products 
higher shipment levels of surface mount components  custom infrastructure products and new consumer products reflect the increasing worldwide demand for wireless components experienced in fiscal compared to space and defense products sales rose million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal defense product sales are increasing due to the higher level of new business booked by the company in fiscal and  which is now in production 
space and defense product bookings were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales minus cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of engineering design costs  material  material fabrication costs  assembly costs  direct and indirect overhead and test costs 
gross profit for fiscal was million  of net sales up million from million of net sales for the same period of the prior year 
gross profit on sales increased in fiscal over last year due to favorable manufacturing efficiencies and a more favorable wireless product mix in the current year 
these efficiencies resulted from higher production volumes at our lower cost china facility and in our defense group  as well as manufacturing overhead cost savings realized by combining the rf power and amitron production facilities into one operation at anaren ceramics 
current year growth in gross profit was lowered by the recognition of  of stock option equity based compensation expense in cost of sales in fiscal marketing 
marketing expenses consist mainly of employee related costs  sales commissions  advertising expenses  and travel expenses 
marketing expenses were million  of net sales for fiscal  up from million of net sales for fiscal included in marketing expense for fiscal is  of stock option equity based compensation expense 
absent the inclusion of stock option equity based compensation expense  marketing costs in fiscal declined approximately year over year due to cost savings realized through the consolidation of the rf power and amitron operations during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses consist of material and salaries and related overhead costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities associated with new products and technology development 
research and development expenses were million  of net sales in fiscal  up from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures are supporting further development of wireless infrastructure and consumer component opportunities as well as new technology development in the space and defense group 
research and development expenditures increased in fiscal over fiscal levels due to the higher level of wireless opportunities in the marketplace and due to the inclusion of  for stock option equity based compensation expense 
these opportunities resulted in the hiring of additional product development personnel in fiscal and  and additional outside vendor spending by the company in the current year to expedite the new product development process 
the company does not expect to reduce its current research and development efforts and is presently working on a number of new standard and custom wireless and space and defense products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of employee related expenses  professional services  intangible amortization  travel related expenses and other corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal  from million of net sales for fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the inclusion of  of stock option equity based compensation expense in fiscal absent the inclusion of stock option equity based compensation expense  general and administrative costs for fiscal was down compared to fiscal due to consolidation savings and lower sarbanes oxley compliance costs in fiscal restructuring 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal restructuring cost which consisted of wages  health insurance  payroll taxes and outplacement costs were  in fiscal these costs were related to the termination of people in conjunction with the closure of rf power s facility and the move of that operation to salem  new hampshire in the second quarter of fiscal operating income operating income increased million  or in fiscal to million of net sales compared to million of net sales for last fiscal year 
in fiscal  operating income was reduced by million for stock option equity based compensation expense 
operating income for fiscal does not include any expense for stock option equity based compensation 
operating income has improved significantly in fiscal due to manufacturing efficiencies achieved through operation consolidations and sales volume increases  the relative flat levels of marketing in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the absence of one time consolidation and restructuring charges in the current year compared to fiscal  which included million of one time charges 
on a reporting segment basis  wireless operating income was million for fiscal including million of stock option equity based compensation expense  up million from wireless operating income of million for last year 
wireless operating income improved significantly in the current year due to cost savings achieved through the consolidation of the rf power and amitron operations in fiscal  the absence of consolidation charges million in fiscal  cost efficiencies resulting from higher manufacturing volumes in the company s china operation  and a more favorable wireless product mix in the current year compared to last fiscal year 
space and defense operating income fell  in fiscal to million including million of stock option equity based compensation expense compared to million in fiscal this decrease  despite a rise in sales volume  resulted from the large number of new space and defense programs entering production over the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal  as well as the million of stock option equity based compensation 
these programs in their early production phase require a higher level of engineering support  have lower manufacturing yields and efficiencies than more mature programs 
operating margins in this group improved in the second half of fiscal and are expected to improve further as the new programs mature 
other income 
other income increased to million of net sales for year ended june   from million of net sales for fiscal year this increase was caused mainly by the rise in market interest rates over the past eighteen months and the absence of losses on equipment and investment sales in the current fiscal year compared to  of losses recorded in fiscal other income will fluctuate based on short term market interest rates and the level of investable cash balances

the company s effective tax rate is a direct result of the proportion of federally exempt state municipal bond income  the amount of non taxable income of the company s china subsidiary  and federal tax credits and benefits in relation to the levels of taxable income or loss 
the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of both the higher level of income and the amount of nondeductible incentive stock option equity based compensation expense in fiscal compared to the level of deductible non statutory stock option equity based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas r 
stock options issued prior to the adoption of sfas r were mainly incentive stock options and are presently generating the majority of the company s equity based employee stock option compensation expense

the increase in sales of wireless products was a result of a million increase in sales to nokia of wireless custom subassemblies due to a new design win in fiscal this new custom assembly contract resulted in total revenue of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal sales of standard component wireless products were flat at million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  reflecting the steady annual worldwide demand for wireless infrastructure components over the two year period 
sales in the space and defense products rose million  or in fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year 
this increase consisted of a million rise in sales of defense products  which was partially off set by a million decline in space product shipments during the current fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal defense product sales are increasing due to the higher level of new defense business booked by the company in fiscal and  which is now in production 
defense product bookings in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million of net sales  compared to million of net sales for the prior year 
gross margins as a percent of sales declined percentage points due to a change in sales mix from higher margin standard wireless component products to lower margin custom wireless products 
additionally  margins were eroded by a one time write down of inventory at rf power in conjunction with the closure of the bohemia  new york facility and general production inefficiencies during the period of actual consolidation of the two operations in salem  new hampshire 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million of net sales for fiscal  from million of net sales for fiscal this increase is a result of higher commission expense caused by the sales increase  and rising travel and support costs due to the higher volume of business 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million of net sales in fiscal  up from million of net sales for fiscal research and development expenditures supported further development of wireless infrastructure products and consumer component opportunities 
research and development expenditures increased in fiscal over fiscal levels due to the higher level of opportunities in the marketplace  which the company responded to by adding new product development engineering personnel during fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal general and administrative costs were flat in fiscal compared with fiscal despite increased expenditures for compliance with sarbanes oxley regulations and one time charges associated with the consolidation of the company s rf power and amitron operations due primarily to the cost savings realized from that consolidation in the second half of fiscal restructuring

the results of operations for anaren europe for fiscal have been classified as discontinued operations in the statements of earnings filed as part of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments management uses in applying the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in the company s financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts general and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible and long lived assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes  which impacts the valuation allowance and the effective tax rate 
management reviews the estimates  including  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income tax valuations on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could and have differed at times from these estimates 
the company s accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to its customers but not yet collected 
the company analyzes various factors including historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is established based on the portion of those accounts receivable which are deemed to be potentially uncollectible 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market  using a standard cost methodology to determine the cost basis for the inventory 
this method approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
the recoverability of inventories is based on the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
the company evaluates the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as needed 
these adjustments  when made  would have an impact on the company s financial statements in the period that they were recorded 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their residual values over those estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
long lived assets with estimated useful lives are depreciated to their residual values over those useful lives in proportion to the economic value consumed 
long lived assets are tested for impairment at the group level  which is usually an economic unit such as a manufacturing facility or department  which has a measurable economic output or product 
long lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable and exceeds its fair market value 
this circumstance exists if the carrying amount of the assets in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by the discounted cash flow or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill is tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by the company at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
valuation methods for determining the fair value of the reporting unit include reviewing quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
if the goodwill is indicated as being impaired the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill and  if it is less  the company would then recognize an impairment loss 
the projection of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the assets and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in changes in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the positive cash flow from operations was due primarily to profit before depreciation in fiscal and and profit before depreciation and equity based compensation expense in fiscal in all three years the positive cash flow from earnings was partially off set by a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable amounting to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  cash flow from operations rose due to million in equity based compensation expense which did not require cash 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million and consisted of capital expenditures of million  including million for infrastructure work in the fourth quarter to support the  square foot building expansion  off set by cash provided by net maturities of marketable debt securities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net maturities of marketable debt securities of million and proceeds from the sale of celeritek  inc equity securities of million  net of capital expenditures of million  including million for the new salem  new hampshire facility 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net maturities of marketable debt securities of million  and a return of capital dividend on celeritek  inc equity securities of million  less million used to fund capital equipment acquisitions 
additionally  in fiscal  million was generated by the discontinued operations in europe from proceeds from the auction sale of surplus capital equipment 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  million was provided by cash and tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options and million was used to purchase  treasury shares 
in fiscal   was provided by the exercise of stock options and million was expended to repurchase million shares of the company s common stock 
of the amount  million was provided by the exercise of stock options and million was used to repurchase million shares of the company s common stock 
the company expects to continue to purchase shares of its common stock in the open market and or through private negotiated transactions under the current board authorization  depending on market conditions 
at june  there were  shares remaining under the current board repurchase authorization 
at june   the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and no debt  and has had positive operating cash flow for over ten years 
the company believes that its cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by currently invested cash balances and expected cash flows from operations 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments accounting standards require disclosure concerning the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as debt guarantees 
the company s obligations and commitments are as follows less total than yr

 accounting changes and error corrections 
statement replaces apb no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement changes the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  the company s fiscal year 
early application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors during fiscal years beginning after june  fasb interpretation was issued in july to clarify the criteria for recognizing tax benefits under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority and will affect many companies reported results and their disclosures of uncertain tax positions 
the interpretation does not prescribe the type of evidence required to support meeting the more likely than not threshold  stating that it depends on the individual facts and circumstances 
the benefit recognized for a tax position meeting the more likely than not criterion is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized 
the measurement of the related benefit is determined by considering the probabilities of the amounts that could be realized upon ultimate settlement  assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts and including expected negotiated settlements with the taxing authority 
interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  the company s fiscal year 
the company is currently analyzing the financial statement impact of adopting this pronouncement 
proposed accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits this fasb proposal would require companies to report on their balance sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the proposal would also require companies to measure plan assets and obligations as of the employer s balance sheet date 
as a result  companies would recognize on their balance sheets actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost that have not yet been included in income 
this could significantly increase reported liabilities for many companies with a corresponding reduction in equity reported as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the provisions for the proposed statement  if passed  would be effective for fiscal years ending after december   the company s fiscal year with earlier application encouraged 
the company is currently analyzing the financial statement impact of adopting this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses the company s possible exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  all of which consisted of highly liquid investments in marketable debt securities 
the marketable debt securities at date of purchase normally have maturities between one and months  are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rate of from june  rates  or  would have reduced net income and cash flow by approximately  or per diluted share for the year 
due to the relatively short maturities of the securities and its ability to hold those investments to maturity  the company does not believe that an immediate decrease in interest rates would have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
over time  however  declines in interest rates will reduce the company s interest income
