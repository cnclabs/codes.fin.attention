if we do not meet performance levels by the end of the operations period under the contract  we are contractually obligated to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
historically  such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations

we will use the proceeds from the sales of facet and foreign diabetes to repay a portion of this debt  as required by certain terms of the new credit facilities

we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows and new credit facilities  taken together  will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  the qui tam legal actions  planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations through at least contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements

as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
other factors affecting liquidity we currently estimate that the additional consideration pursuant to the terms of our earnout agreement for the winninghabits acquisition could be between million to million  although the amount could be more or less depending on the performance of winninghabits 
the final amount will be payable in we previously disclosed that two qui tam actions had been filed against the company and its former subsidiary  diabetes self care  inc  alleging improper claims for medicare payments by the pharmacy and supplies business that the company divested in on march   the company agreed to settle those actions for a total of million  payable on april  this charge was included in earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december  
table of contents uncertainties we are subject to various legal claims and actions incidental to our business and the businesses of our predecessors  including product liability claims and professional liability claims 
we maintain insurance  including insurance covering professional and product liability claims  with customary deductible amounts 
there can be no assurance  however  that i additional suits will not be filed against us in the future  ii our prior experience with respect to the disposition of litigation is representative of the results that will occur in pending or future cases or iii adequate insurance coverage will be available at acceptable prices  if at all  for incidents arising or claims made in the future 
there are no other pending legal or governmental proceedings to which we are a party that we believe would  if adversely resolved  have a material adverse effect on us 
for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  see risk factors in item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
our services are provided telephonically and through home based nursing services through care centers located throughout the united states 
in addition  our services are provided through access to our online health and wellness based tools 
revenues are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts 
our services are paid for primarily on the basis of i monthly fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan  ii each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract  iii each member enrolled in our programs  iv fee for service or iv a fixed rate per case 
billings for certain services occur in advance of services being performed 
such amounts are recorded as unearned revenues  which is included in accrued liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets 
such amounts are subsequently recognized as revenue as services are performed 
some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk ie  refundable if our programs do not achieve certain financial cost savings and clinical performance criteria 
revenues subject to refund are not recognized if i sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements  or ii interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets 
if either of these two conditions exists  we record the amounts as unearned revenue  which is included in accrued liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets 
if we do not meet performance levels by the end of the operations period under the contract  we are contractually obligated to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
historically  such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
in  of our revenues recognized were at risk under these arrangements 
in  revenues from continuing operations were derived from the following types of customers and third party payors approximately from health plans  from employers  from government payors and from aso self insured employer clients 
a significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our trade accounts receivable is susceptible to changes in third party reimbursement policies 
in addition  the collectibility of all of our accounts receivable varies based on payor mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon our evaluation of current 
table of contents industry conditions  historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends  audit activity and other relevant factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the evaluation is performed at each reporting period for each operating unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
the evaluation of the monthly estimates of revenues estimated to be uncollectible has not resulted in material adjustments in any recent period  however  special charges have resulted from certain specific circumstances affecting collectibility 
while estimates and judgments are involved and factors impacting collectibility may change  management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts to be collected 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill arising from business combinations is accounted for under the provision of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and is not amortized 
our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
as of december   we reported goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of our total assets as of december  also  with the acquisition of corsolutions in january  we will record a significant amount of intangible assets in we review goodwill and identifiable intangibles for impairment annually as of december and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related reporting units that have goodwill and indefinite life intangibles assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units based on the present value of estimated future free cash flows 
based on the evaluation  management concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill and intangibles existed at december  the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future revenues and operating costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we based our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the income tax expense was million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for reflected in and were various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting 
as of december   our remaining net operating losses of million  the tax effect of which is reflected on the balance sheet in the deferred tax asset  will be available to offset future taxable income liabilities 
based on projections of taxable income in and future years  management believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
this statement applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  cancelled or vested after that date 
compensation cost will be recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
upon issuance  sfas r required public companies to apply the provisions of the statement in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule that delayed the effective date  requiring public companies to apply the statement in the first annual period beginning after june  except for the deferral of the effective date  the guidance in sfas r was unchanged 
we expect to adopt sfas r in our first interim period of and have concluded that sfas r will have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expect the impact of expensing stock options currently outstanding  as well as the impact of any anticipated stock option grants and restricted stock awards  to be approximately to per share in we do not expect the impact of sfas r to have a material impact on our cash flow or liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for assumptions used calculating the fair value of employee stock options 
accounting changes and error corrections 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  it does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
