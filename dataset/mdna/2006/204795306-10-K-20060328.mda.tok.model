xanalys was acquired during the third quarter of xanalys provides a suite of investigative management and analysis solutions that enable investigators to collect  analyze and share information to solve cases 
we believe that integration of copperfire s and xanalys products will enhance our total offerings in ps j 
management outlook we continue to find ourselves in very challenging times 
we have three major areas of focus o the first is increasing the amount of our backlog 
o the second is migrating to a business model with a more predictable revenue stream 
o the third is to improve our cost structure including evaluating our strategy to determine if we would benefit from focusing on fewer segments  quality  and customer and employee satisfaction 
our backlog is a key indicator of what our future revenues will look like 
our backlog peaked at december   at which time it exceeded million 
the december  quarter is the third consecutive quarter in which we experienced a quarter over quarter increase 
backlog was approximately million at december   as shown in the following table institutional integrated public security attack electronics safety and backlog in thousands systems protection systems justice total december       december       december       march       june       september       december       historically  approximately of our revenues were generated from sources where the ultimate client is a federal  state or local government unit 
during the last few years  due to the general economic slowdown  state and local budgets  which we are dependent on for approximately of our revenue sources  have come under intense pressure 
most states were running in a deficit situation  as were many local governments 
this caused many of them to delay and in some cases cancel many infrastructure projects until such time as their economic fortunes rebound 
in recent months  tax revenues have been improving resulting in increased activity preparatory to the issuance of bids and ultimately the awarding of new projects 
in addition  we have increased our sales and marketing efforts with a specific objective of marketing to the commercial sector which inherently offers faster project implementation schedules 
our second area of focus is the reengineering of our business model so that it contains a greater percentage of recurring revenue 
as indicated in the following table  approximately of the revenue in was generated from recurring revenue sources primarily maintenance revenues  and the majority of these revenues occurred in our public safety and justice segment 
we define one time revenue as revenue derived from discrete projects  from which we do not expect to generate incremental revenue upon the completion of the project 
we define recurring revenue as sources of revenue from which we anticipate receiving revenue in the current  as well as future periods  for example annual renewable maintenance contracts 
year ended december  in thousands one time revenue recurring revenue total institutional security systems    attack protection   integrated electronic systems    public safety and justice    total    since the majority of our revenues are one time revenues and are non recurring  we must reinvent our book of business on a continual basis 
this makes it very difficult for us to project our future revenue stream and thus makes it very difficult for us to project our earnings as well as our business outlook 
over the next five years  we intend to modify our business model to rely less upon one time sources of revenue and more on recurring sources of revenue 
our third focus area is to improve our cost structure  quality  and client and employee satisfaction 
our institutional security systems and attack protection business segments are undergoing significant organizational and expense restructuring  including a partial consolidation of regional office efforts and an increased focus on centralized performance of the most complicated security projects 
this initiative began by ensuring our organization is properly aligned with our clients needs 
many changes have been made and initial results indicate that our cost  our quality  our clients and our employees are responding favorably to the changes implemented thus far 
we have much room for improvement as we move toward a more client oriented organization 
the organization re alignment is critical to strengthening our future as it allows us to deploy the six sigma and lean manufacturing methodologies across all our business segments more efficiently 
the six sigma methodology focuses on defect elimination  which will have a direct impact on our cost  quality  and client satisfaction 
lean manufacturing also focuses on reduction of costs and elimination of waste 
in addition  in light of the escalating selling  general and administrative costs associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  we are evaluating our structure and strategy to determine if a less decentralized  or other organizational structure would result in lower selling  general and administrative costs and we are evaluating our strategy to determine if we would benefit from focusing on fewer segments 
we believe that if we address and implement successfully the above three areas of focus  we will significantly enhance our future growth opportunities and will provide for more predictable financial results 
during the second half of  we expanded our offerings in the public safety and justice segment by acquiring the assets of degrees and copperfire 
degrees provides a web based fire records management system  which is being integrated into our current ps j product offerings 
degrees enterprise wide records management solutions assist fire and emergency medical service agencies in managing responses to emergency situations 
we anticipate that as we integrate degrees product offerings into our ps j product offerings  the open web based technology from degrees will advance our current fire and rescue product offerings 
copperfire provides customized report writing and forms generation software designed specifically for public safety and justice agencies 
the software automates an agency s current business practices  turning hard copy forms into digital images  to create a paperless report writing system 
xanalys was acquired during the third quarter of xanalys provides a suite of investigative management and analysis solutions that enable investigators to collect  analyze and share information to solve cases 
we believe that integration of copperfire s and xanalys products will enhance our total offerings in ps j 
on may   we filed a form k disclosing that the we failed to timely file an amendment to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  to provide management s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december  and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting together  the report required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of on may   we received a notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market stating that due to our failure to timely file the report  we were no longer in compliance with the requirements of marketplace rule c 
the rule requires us to file with nasdaq copies of all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission on or before the date they are required to be filed with the sec 
on june   the company filed its form k a with the sec containing the report 
on june   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel advised compudyne that compudyne had remedied its filing delinquency and was in full compliance with nasdaq market place rules 
on december  the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
revisions to accelerated filer definition and accelerated deadlines for filing periodic reports the release 
the release revised the definition of accelerated filer to make it simpler for accelerated filers whose public float falls below the million threshold on the measurement date of june to exit accelerated filer status 
under the new rules  an accelerated filer that has voting and non voting equity held by non affiliates of less than million at the end of its second fiscal quarter is permitted to exit accelerated filer status at the end of that year and to file its annual report for that year and subsequent periodic reports on a non accelerated basis 
accelerated filer status affects an issuer s deadlines for filing its periodic reports with the sec and complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of a non accelerated filer must begin to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements including the attestation report of a registered public accounting firm for its first fiscal year ending on or after july  the company exited accelerated filer status as of december  the aggregate worldwide market value of compudyne corporation s equity held by non affiliates as of june   the last business day of compudyne s second fiscal quarter  was less than million 
as a result  as of december   compudyne exited accelerated filer status 
prior to the release compudyne was classified as an accelerated filer and was required to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in light of the release  compudyne  as a non accelerated filer as of december   is not required to comply with section for the year ended december  results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
as discussed below  the decrease occurred primarily from our ies and ps j segments offset by increases from our iss and ap segments 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment were million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year representing an increase of million or 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry  as opposed to sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the increase in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to our working on more projects than we did in the previous year 
backlog for iss had decreased from million at december  to million at december  backlog was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the years and were slow bidding periods for the company 
although the gross amount of construction spending in the corrections area remained relatively flat between and  the types of projects that the company solicits  namely large scale medium to maximum security installations  declined significantly in and this situation was further compounded by the general state and local governmental budget deficits which caused these governmental units to rethink and delay many of their pending corrections projects 
beginning in early  iss is seeing significant  heightened bidding activity  particularly in the market space it serves  namely large scale medium to maximum security prisons 
this increased bidding activity is expected to result in securing more projects  which should result in increased revenue 
during the last three quarters of  iss backlog increased significantly providing the segment with a greater opportunity to generate revenue during the second half of revenues from the attack protection segment were million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the same period of representing an increase of million or 
in the company purchased an existing  square foot factory for the attack protection segment on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this capacity increase was largely driven by the company s expectation that the demands for its products  principally its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors would accelerate significantly in the post september  world 
throughout   and this anticipated increase in demand did not materialize leaving the segment with significant excess capacity 
this segment is composed of two chief product offerings  namely norshield  which encompasses bullet and blast resistant windows and doors and ancillary products  and fiber sensys  which encompasses fiber optic intrusion detection systems 
for the year ended december  the norshield line experienced a increase in revenues as compared to the year ended december   whereas the fiber sensys line experienced a decrease in revenues for the comparable period 
the increase in revenue of million in the norshield line is a direct result of the award of a major contract won in the fourth quarter of execution on this contract began immediately upon award 
fiber sensys revenue decline is a result of the rollout of its next generation product  which until its testing is completed  expected in the first quarter of  has and will continue to negatively impact revenues 
the slow down in the government building process experienced during and has reversed 
projects are now being released for construction  and thus the attack protection segment is experiencing increased bidding activity for its products 
during  the company furnished bids to supply its products for eight new embassy projects 
at the time  this was the largest number of embassy projects bid in a single calendar year for this segment 
the company was awarded four of these embassy projects  for a total compudyne contract value of million  and lost the remaining four embassy project bids to competitors 
during  we bid on fifteen new embassy projects 
through december  the company was awarded seven of these embassy projects for a total contract value of million  and lost seven embassy project bids to competitors  with one project still awaiting award 
in  twenty eight embassy projects were planned 
we believe that this increased level of new embassy construction will continue for the next several years 
through december  the company had been awarded three of these projects  one of which was for a total of million  and lost one project and one bulk bid embassy project comprising eight embassies to competitors  with sixteen projects still awaiting award 
revenues from integrated electronic systems were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
a significant portion of this segment s revenue is backlog driven 
backlog at both december  and december  was million 
ies revenue decline was largely due to certain government clients  for which the segment receives repeat business  having had their budgets significantly reduced 
this decrease was partially offset by a new million project 
the first half of was a difficult time for ies  with a downturn in revenues and gross profit  ensuing from a delay in a large scale installation contract  pending the government s completion of the building to house the system s command and control center  a reduction in an ongoing governmental integration program  resulting from the department of defense s base relocation and closure brac program  delays in several significant awards  because funding had been redirected to the war efforts in iraq and afghanistan  and a delay in the start up of a year  million security contract  due to an award protest by the predecessor contractor 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
the decline was primarily the result of lower backlogs and an increased focus on developing our next generation product which resulted in more hours worked on research and development and less hours worked on revenue generating projects 
revenues were also impacted by relatively low contract signing rates in early  low billing rates and difficult performance requirements on some contracts 
the lower levels of backlog did  however  start to improve late in the year 
during the fourth quarter of ps j redeployed a portion of its technical staff  typically deployed in the research and development area  to work on projects  resulting in increased revenue 
it should be noted that although we made three acquisitions in this segment  two in degrees and copperfire and one in august xanalys  these acquisitions had little impact on public safety and justice s revenues due to their relatively small size 
expenses 
cost of sales of million for the year ended december  were down million or from million during the same period of the smaller percentage decrease in sales as compared to the percentage decrease in cost of goods sold resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of for the year ended december  as compared to in in  the windows and door component of the attack protection segment experienced significant operating inefficiencies and difficulties 
these inefficiencies and difficulties  which did not recur in  reduced the gross profit percentage 
cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment of million for the year ended december  were up million or from million during the same period of this increase was less than the related sales increase of this segment of  resulting in a increase in the gross profit percentage to from for the year ended december  this increase in gross profit percentage resulted mainly from one of this segment s customers terminating its contract for convenience  resulting in the recognition of million in gross margin 
starting in and continuing through  institutional security systems senior management identified managerial problems at its west coast operations and determined that numerous problems existed there  including that the costs to complete its projects were going to be significantly higher than was previously projected 
this resulted in significant cost overruns on many of these projects 
as the work on the projects progressed  the institutional security systems segment identified additional cost overruns which caused the costs to complete these projects to increase 
although the problem projects identified in are substantially all complete  the problems in the iss west coast operations continued into  and the west coast office continues to be affected by one final contract which requires iss to install a proprietary duress system which has been validated through an independent consultant and the manufacturer of the equipment but will not function as required by the contract specifications 
iss has incurred significant costs trying to make the equipment function as desired 
the customer is working with iss to develop a level of acceptance  and both iss and the customer are cooperating to close out the project in an amicable manner 
we believe that all future costs on these projects have been adequately accounted for through december  senior management at the west coast operations has been replaced as well as certain project management and engineering staff 
it should be noted that the west coast office has been downsized to a sales and support office  consolidating the estimating  electronics engineering and electronics fabrication functions into the montgomery home office 
the project management and hardline engineering staff has been upgraded to experienced professional personnel  and this office only manages projects specifically suited to their expertise or as required by the local marketplace 
the west coast office realized eleven consecutive months of positive gross margins on such projects in despite these positive gross margins  the west coast office experienced high legal and overhead costs closing out many of the old projects 
while this resulted in an overall loss at the west coast operation  the office was also able to significantly reduce aged receivables and filed multiple claims for possible future upside recovery 
the office is in the process of moving its facilities to a smaller  more cost effective facility  which will further reduce overhead costs in the future 
the west coast problems  including project overruns  resulted in pre tax losses recorded in the following periods  in thousands second half of  full year  full year  first quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of total west coast losses  to address this situation  the company has implemented more centralized controls  replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations and its alabama headquarters  and has reorganized the function of the west coast office 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment of million for the year ended december  decreased million or from million during the same period of this decrease was not proportional when compared to the relative sales increase  resulting in a increase in the gross profit percentage to from during the year ended december  significant factors contributing to this increase in gross profit included the fact that in  significant operating inefficiencies and difficulties were experienced by the windows and doors components of the attack protection segment 
these inefficiencies and difficulties amounted to approximately million  which contributed to the reduction of the gross profit percentage 
they did not recur in due to new senior management hired in january that has reduced manufacturing and overhead costs 
in addition  one of this segment s customers terminated its contracts for convenience during the first quarter of resulting in the recognition of million in gross margin due to contract closeout activities 
cost of goods sold in the integrated electronic systems segment of million for the year ended december  decreased million or from million during the same period of this decrease was consistent with the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a increase in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment of million for the year ended december  was down million or from million during this decrease was more than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a increase in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of much of this increase is related to additional costs incurred by the company related to compliance with new requirements mandated by the sarbanes oxley act and the sec 
the company expended approximately million to perform its audit  which did not require a sox report 
this was paid to our independent registered public accounting firm for audit and audit related services 
for the audit  the company expended million for external third party costs to complete its audit and its sox report 
of this amount  approximately million was paid to our independent registered public accounting firm for audit and audit related services with the balance paid to various consultants and others who have assisted the company in the process 
expenses related to audit and sox of million and million were recorded during the years ended december  and  respectively  for services provided or accrued for during these periods 
in addition  ap s selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of increased legal costs associated with ongoing claims resolutions in actions both as plaintiff and defendant and for increased selling and training costs as the segment is trying to expand its presence into new marketplaces 
ps j s selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of increased headcount and related costs from the three acquisitions made by ps j in and in addition  the xanalys acquisition contributed approximately thousand to this increase 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the assets of degrees and copperfire and the stock of xanalys and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  the company determined the fair value of the following identifiable assets and assigned the indicated lives for the purposes of amortization and depreciation 
amount in thousands life in years software  non compete agreements tradename the amortization of the above assets resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to these assets of thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively  which is included in operating expenses 
in an effort to further reduce costs  during the company eliminated the position of chief operating officer and had its division presidents report directly to the company s ceo 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of being a technology driven enterprise  the company s public safety and justice segment continually updates and enhances its software offerings  thus incurring significant research and development costs 
during public safety and justice started investing in its next generation products and expended thousand for this project  and is expected to spend million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or from million for the same period of the following table compares the weighted average of the company s twelve months ended december  and interest bearing borrowings  in thousands  and the related rates charged thereon monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate bank borrowings industrial revenue bonds   subordinated borrowings   swap hedge agreement   in addition the company recorded the following non cash interest expense  in thousands amortization and write off of deferred financing charges taxes on income 
the effective tax rate was a benefit of for the year ended december  and the effective tax benefit rate was approximately for the year ended december  the company s tax benefit of million for the year ended december  was primarily a result of the company s ability to carryback the loss incurred in to prior years  resulting in federal and state tax receivables 
since all available tax loss prior year receivables were used via the carrybacks  no such receivables were available to offset the december  losses generated by the company 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  is primarily a result of thousand previously recorded as a reserve for uncertain tax positions which is no longer needed  partially offset by state tax expenses 
the company has decided to provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  as it has determined that due to the company s recent operating losses there is uncertainty as to whether more likely than not the assets will be realized 
the company had net operating loss carryforwards for financial accounting purposes of million at december net loss 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million for the year ended december  diluted loss per share was a loss of for the year ended december  and a loss of for the year ended december  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents used in computing eps was million in both and years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
as discussed below  most of this decline occurred in our iss segment due to delayed projects at the state and local levels  largely caused by significant budget deficits many governmental units are currently experiencing 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry  as opposed to sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the decrease in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to our working on less projects than we did in the previous year 
the principal reason for the decline was that its backlog had decreased from million at december  to million at december  thus resulting in less work available to be performed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  backlog at december  had declined further to million 
the years and have been slow bidding periods for the company 
although the gross amount of construction spending in the corrections area remained relatively flat between  and  the types of projects that the company solicits  namely large scale medium to maximum security installations  declined in and this situation was further compounded by the general state and local governmental budget deficits which are causing these governmental units to rethink and delay many of their pending corrections projects 
revenues from the attack protection segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
in the company purchased an existing  square foot factory for the attack protection segment on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this capacity increase was largely driven by the company s expectation that the demands for its products  principally its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors would accelerate significantly in the post september  world 
throughout  and this anticipated increase in demand did not materialize leaving the segment with significant excess capacity 
this segment is composed of two chief product offerings  namely norshield  which encompasses bullet and blast resistant windows and doors and ancillary products  and fiber sensys  which encompasses fiber optic intrusion detection systems 
for the year ended december  the norshield line experienced a decline in revenues as compared to the year ended december   whereas the fiber sensys line experienced a increase in revenues for the comparable period 
the company continues to see heightened interest for its fiber sensys products and expects sales for these items to continue to experience sustainable growth 
the slow down in the government building process experienced during and appears to have stabilized 
it appears that projects are being released for construction  and thus the attack protection segment is experiencing increased bidding activity for its products 
during the company furnished bids to supply its products for eight new embassy projects 
at the time  this was the largest number of embassy projects bid in a single calendar year for this segment 
through december   the company was awarded four of these embassy projects  for a total compudyne contract value of million  and lost the remaining four embassy projects 
during  we bid on fifteen new embassy projects 
through march the company was awarded six of these embassy projects for a total contract value of million  and lost seven embassy projects to competitors  with two projects still awaiting award 
in  preliminary indications show eighteen embassy projects will be available for bid 
it appears to us that this increased level of new embassy construction will continue for the next several years 
revenues from the integrated electronic systems segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
a significant portion of this segment s revenue is backlog driven 
the integrated electronic systems segment ended with a backlog level of million 
backlog at december  was million and at december  was also million 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the same period of representing a decrease of million or 
in  the company recognized approximately million of revenue related to hardware supplied under a contract with one of its customers 
minimal margin was earned on this hardware 
although ps j ships certain hardware components to clients on an occasional basis  shipments of this magnitude of hardware  done to accommodate our client  is an unusual and non routine event 
in addition  it should be noted that although we made two acquisitions in this segment in degrees and copperfire  these acquisitions had little impact on public safety and justice s revenues due to their relatively small size and due to their occurring in the later part of the year 
expenses 
cost of goods sold of million for the year ended december  were down million or from million during the same period of this decrease was a result of decreased costs of goods sold of million at the institutional security systems segment  largely attributable to the decreased sales of this segment 
the smaller percentage decrease in sales as compared to the percentage decrease in cost of goods sold resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of for the year ended december  as compared to in cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment of million for the year ended december  were down million or from million during the same period of this decrease was less than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  starting in and continuing through  institutional security systems senior management identified managerial problems at its west coast operations and determined that numerous problems existed there including that the costs to complete its projects were going to be significantly higher than was previously projected 
this was a result of significant cost overruns on many of these projects 
as the work on the projects progressed  the institutional security systems segment identified additional cost overruns which would cause the costs to complete these projects to increase as a result of the changes in the estimates to complete 
although the problem projects identified in are substantially all complete  the problems in the iss west coast operations continued into and we realized that the management changes made in did not adequately address the root problems identified  and as a result  projects started after continued to experience cost overruns due to a lack of appropriate oversight 
staff and management changes in iss are ongoing 
we have revised our estimates to complete these projects and believe that all future costs on these projects have been adequately considered through december  the west coast problems  including project overruns  resulted in losses recorded in the following periods in thousands second half of  first half of  third quarter of fourth quarter of  first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  total west coast losses  to address this situation  the company is implementing more centralized controls  replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations and its alabama headquarters  and hired a chief operating officer 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment of million for the year ended december  increased million or from million during the same period of this increase occurred in spite of a sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from during the year ended december  we are actively working to better utilize the  square foot factory the company purchased in montgomery  alabama 
the airteq manufacturing operation in oregon was relocated in the latter part of and consolidated into this facility 
this was done in an effort to enhance the utilization of our owned facilities in alabama and thus absorb some of our excess manufacturing capacity 
although not the primary contributor  this did result in further utilization of approximately  square feet of previously unused manufacturing space in this plant in alabama 
in addition  we identified  in late  a quality problem with the windows and doors being installed on a project ultimately completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of this identified problem  we took remedial action in the field to repair this defect 
during the year ended december  we increased our estimated cost to complete this project by million thus causing this project to become a negative margin project 
cumulative write downs on this project amount to million 
cost of goods sold in the integrated electronic systems segment of million for the year ended december  decreased million or from million during the same period of this decrease was less than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment of million for the year ended december  was down million or from million during this decrease was more than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage to from in the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  our public safety and justice segment received a complaint alleging that we breached our contract to provide a public safety software system to a client 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax charge  of which thousand was recorded as a reduction of revenue and million was recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
during the second quarter of this matter was settled  resulting in a reversal of million of the accrued charge  which was reflected as a reduction of cost of sales 
the net of this activity contributed million of the million gross profit improvement in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of much of this increase is related to additional costs incurred by the company related to legal fees in connection with responding to and settling the complaint filed by a public safety and justice segment client  expenses incurred in connection with evaluating potential acquisitions  recruiting fees incurred to fill the recently hired coo position and other senior management positions and expenses related to compliance with new requirements mandated by the sarbanes oxley act and the sec 
during the fourth quarter of the company concluded that the continuing decline in the backlog in its iss segment constituted a triggering event which caused the company to conclude it was necessary to reassess and ultimately write off goodwill in the amount of million and certain other intangibles in the amount of million 
those amounts appear as a separate line item in the statement of operations 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the assets of degrees and copperfire and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  the company preliminarily determined the fair value of the following identifiable assets and assigned the indicated lives for the purposes of amortization and depreciation 
amount in thousands life in years software  employment contracts the amortization of the above assets resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to these assets of thousand in  which is included in operating expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the same period of being a technology driven enterprise  the company s public safety and justice segment continually updates and enhances its software offerings  thus incurring significant research and development costs 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to an increase in borrowings and overall higher interest rates 
the following table compares the weighted average of the company s years ended december  and december  interest bearing borrowings and the related rates charged thereon 
monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate in thousands in thousands bank borrowings  industrial revenue bonds   subordinated borrowings  swap hedge agreement   in addition the company recorded the following non cash interest expense amortization and write off of deferred financing charges taxes on income 
the effective tax benefit was approximately for the year ended december  and the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  the difference in rates is largely attributable to the losses experienced in and the related valuation allowance established for substantially all of the company s net deferred tax assets as of december net loss income 
the company reported net loss income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reason for the loss in was the significant decline in revenues 
while the company was able to significantly reduce its cost of goods sold  its selling  general and administrative expenses increased while its revenues significantly decreased  contributing to the loss 
diluted earnings per share decreased to a loss of in the year ended december  from a profit of 
in the year ended december  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents used in computing eps was million in and million in liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations through cash flows generated from its operations  bank and public financings  and the sale of its common stock 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from cash necessary to carry its inventories and billed and unbilled receivables  for capital expenditures  to repurchase shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program  for payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and for acquisitions 
the ultimate clients of the company are primarily federal  state and local governmental units 
in the event the funding of these governmental units is reduced for any reason  including budgetary reductions due to economic conditions  there is a risk that the demand for the company s goods and services would decrease which would reduce the availability of funds to the company 
as of december   the company had working capital of million compared with million as of december  net cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december  versus million provided by operating activities during the year ended december  this decrease was largely caused by the decline in revenues and the million loss experienced by the company 
the largest component of cash used in operating activities was an increase in accounts receivable of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in cost in excess of billings of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   the net of marketable securities bought and redeemed was an increase of cash of million

net cash used in financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december  compared with a net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  the amount in was primarily provided through the issuance of the notes  offset by the repayment of million of bank borrowings 
the following table summarizes contractual obligations consisting of total notes payable  non cancelable operating lease obligations and related interest of the company as of december  and the payments due by period  in thousands 
non cancelable interest on notes payable operating leases contractual obligations december thereafter   totals    in addition  the company enters into purchase obligations to procure equipment and services  including subcontractor contracts  in the performance of the day to day operations of its business 
substantially all of these obligations are covered by our existing backlog and the revenues generated by these backlogs are expected to be sufficient to meet any payment obligations resulting from these purchase commitments 
on january   the company completed the offering of the notes 
the offering was for million principal amount 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share

during january  the company repaid substantially all of its outstanding bank borrowings from the proceeds of the issuance of its notes 
the company did not prepay any of its industrial revenue bond irb borrowings as it determined that there are certain favorable tax treatments afforded the company when it entered into these irbs  which it would lose in the event these borrowings were prepaid 
on october  and march   the company and its bank entered into amendments to its credit agreement pursuant to which the bank waived the company s non compliance with its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of september  and non compliance with its minimum ebitda covenant as of december   respectively 
in addition  the company and its bank amended the credit agreement to eliminate the million line of credit maturing march and to require borrowings under its million line of credit to be secured by pledged marketable securities equal to of the value of such borrowings or cash equal to the value of such borrowings 
the credit agreement was also amended to permanently eliminate the quarterly minimum ebitda covenant effective as of the company s first quarter ended march  and to provide that the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  maximum debt to ebitda ratio covenant and the minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant were not to become effective until march  on may   the company s bank confirmed in writing that there will not be any event of default under the various credit agreements  by virtue of the company s failure to timely file an amendment to its annual report on form k for the year ended december  the k to provide management s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december  and the related report of the company s independent registered public accounting firm on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting together  the report required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the report was filed with the sec on form k a on june  on november   the company and its bank entered into an additional amendment to the credit agreement pursuant to which the bank agreed to increase its commitment to lend under the company s revolving line of credit from  to  to increase the letter of credit subfacility from  to  and to terminate the swing line subfacility 
on december   the company and its bank entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit and security agreement the second restated credit agreement 
the second restated credit agreement amended and restated the company s amended and restated credit agreement dated march  in connection with the execution of the second restated credit agreement  the company provided the bank with collateral that includes all receivables  equipment  general intangibles  inventory  investment property  real property and a security interest in subsidiary stock 
the second restated credit agreement allows the company to obtain revolving advances in a principle amount of up to  revolving advances are limited by a borrowing base formula based upon the value of the company s receivables  inventory  fixed assets  real property and issued and outstanding letters of credit 
the maximum aggregate face amount of letters of credit that may be drawn under the second restated credit agreement is limited to  the second restated credit agreement matures on december  revolving advances under the second restated credit agreement bear interest  at the election of the company  at a variable rate equal to the alternate base rate  a prime interest based rate  or the eurodollar rate plus two and one half percent 
for letters of credit  the company shall pay an amount equal to the average daily face amount of each outstanding letter of credit multiplied by two and one half percent per annum  and a fronting fee of one quarter of one percent per annum  together with other administrative fees and charges 
the company paid its bank a closing fee of  in connection with the execution of the second restated credit agreement 
the company is also required to pay the bank an unused fee equal to three eighths of one percent per annum of the amount by which  exceeds the average daily unpaid balance of the revolving advances and undrawn amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  the company is required to pay a collateral monitoring fee equal to  per month and a collateral evaluation fee as required 
the second restated credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants 
on the closing date  the company was required to have undrawn availability of at least  and thereafter the company is required to maintain an unrestricted undrawn borrowing base availability of at least  commencing with the fiscal quarter ending june   the company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to the company s total outstanding borrowings at december  amounted to approximately million  net of broker s discounts in the amount of million 
the notes accounted for million  net of broker s discounts  of these borrowings 
the remaining amount of million resulted from borrowings at variable rates and consisted of two industrial revenue bonds outstanding in the amounts of million and million 
the average interest rate charged to the company at december  for its industrial revenue bonds was 
the variable interest rate for these borrowings fluctuated between and during the year ended december  based on weekly market conditions 
these bonds are fully collateralized by bank letters of credit issued under the company s bank agreement 
the company s bank considers letters of credit as outstanding borrowings when considering the amount of availability the company has remaining under its line of credit 
other than the company s letters of credit  which amounted to million at december   the company has no other material off balance sheet liabilities 
at december  the company had million of unused availability 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and its currently available cash will enable the company to meet its liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
the company  however  may require additional financing to pursue acquisitions  and to meet its long term liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if such financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
from time to time  the company may be party to one or more non binding letters of intent regarding material acquisitions  which  if consummated  may be paid for with cash or through the issuance of a significant number of shares of the company s common stock 
the company has not been profitable and in fact has recorded significant losses over the previous two years 
we recognize that the return to profitability is a critical objective which the company must attain 
the company continues to have a significant amount of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet at december   however  the company must return to profitability prior to depleting its current cash and marketable securities 
on may   we filed a form k disclosing that we failed to timely file an amendment to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  to provide management s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december  and the related report of our independent registered public accounting firm on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting together  the report required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of on may   the company s bank confirmed in writing that there will not be any event of default under the various credit agreements  by virtue of the company s failure to file its report required by section of sarbanes oxley in a timely manner 
on may   we received a notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market stating that due to our failure to timely file the report  we were no longer in compliance with the requirements of marketplace rule c 
the rule requires us to file with nasdaq copies of all reports required to be filed with the securities and exchange commission on or before the date they are required to be filed with the sec 
on june   the company filed its form k a with the sec containing the report 
on june   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel advised compudyne that compudyne had remedied its filing delinquency and was in full compliance with nasdaq market place rules 
another consequence of not filing the report timely as noted above includes our inability to use a shorter form registration document for one year in the event we were to engage in an offering of our securities 
this could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and the cost of raising capital 
additional considerations bid bonds and payment and performance bonds historically  certain of the company s projects have required bid bonds at time of proposal submission and payment and or performance bonds upon contract award 
the majority of these bonds have been needed in the iss and ps j segments 
recently  approximately of iss work has come from jobs where payment and performance bonds are required and for ps j  of its work has required payment and performance bonds 
the company s recent losses have made it more challenging for the company to attain the bonding needed to procure certain of its projects 
as of december   the company was required to provide collateral for two of its projects which it did by issuing bank letters of credit as collateral in the amount of approximately million in total 
in the event the company is unable to obtain bonds  or if the terms  namely additional collateral  of the bonds are not within the financial means of the company  the amount of work the company is able to contract for will be negatively impacted 
cost containment due to current economic conditions  the company s losses  and in light of a very strong competitive environment  the company recognizes that its ability to increase the prices it charges its clients is limited 
in addition  in light of escalating selling  general and administrative costs associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  we are evaluating our strategy to determine if a revised strategy would result in lower selling  general and administrative costs 
as a result  in order to enhance our profitability  the company will continue to seek ways to reduce its costs 
total backlog compudyne s backlog amounted to million at december  this was an increase of from the company s december  backlog of million 
the break down of the company s backlog by segment is as follows  in thousands december  institutional security systems   attack protection   integrated electronic systems   public safety and justice   total   included in the backlog of the iss  ap and ps j segments at december  is million  million and million  respectively  representing awards received by the segment for which the clients have not yet entered into signed contracts 
these awards are expected to result in signed contracts over the next twelve months 
corporate reorganization as part of the company s efforts to better manage its costs  during the first quarter of the company implemented a corporate reorganization whereby it converted several corporate entities into llcs limited liability corporations 
this activity was designed to improve the company s tax reporting structure and should help better manage the company s state income tax obligations 
in conjunction with this reorganization  our federal security systems group  formerly known as quanta systems corporation  was re formed as compudyne integrated electronics division  llc  and our public safety and justice group  formerly known as tiburon  was renamed compudyne public safety and justice  inc in addition  corrlogic  inc 
was converted to corrlogic  llc and fiber sensys  inc was converted to fiber sensys  llc 
the impact of this reorganization is not expected to have a material effect on operations 
in addition  in light of escalating selling  general and administrative costs associated with the current heightened regulatory environment  we are evaluating our structure to determine if another organizational structure would result in lower selling  general and administrative costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates percentage of completion accounting and revenue recognition 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from long term contracts where revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company s software related contracts utilize labor hours incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project hours to determine the completion percentage 
the company s construction contracts utilize costs incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project costs to determine the completion percentage 
both of these methods require considerable judgment and  as such  the estimates derived at any point in time could differ significantly from actual results 
these estimates affect many of the balance sheet and statement of operations accounts including net sales  cost of goods sold  accounts receivable  contract costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of contract costs incurred 
revenues for support and maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
sales of products unrelated to contract revenue are recognized as revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method 
costs included in inventories consist of materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  which are related to the purchase and production of inventories 
warranty reserves are estimated and made at the time products are sold or services are rendered 
they are established using historical information on the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
the company warrants numerous products  the terms of which vary widely 
in general  the company warrants its products against defect and specific non performance 
accounts receivable are expected to be substantially collected within one year except for a portion of the receivables recorded as retainage 
retainage expected to be collected in over one year is reflected as a current asset as it will be collected within the operating cycle under the related contract 
tax valuation allowances are established when the company believes it is not more likely than not that the company will be able to receive tax benefits in the future 
the federal income tax benefit recorded in represents the reduction of a liability maintained for uncertain tax positions which was no longer required 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually during the fourth quarter of the year or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the company s reporting units fair value and result in an impairment charge 
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and intangible assets subject to amortization totaled approximately million  net  at december  the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect these values 
stock compensation policy 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method and in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
economic conditions and the after effect of the september  terrorist attacks much of the work compudyne performs is for state and local governmental units 
these entities were severely impacted by recent economic conditions and the resulting contraction of the tax bases of these governmental units 
this has caused these governmental units to carefully evaluate their budgets and defer expenses and projects where possible 
much of the work of the company s public safety and justice and institutional security systems segments is contracted with these state and local governmental units 
as a result  these segments have seen delays in new work available to be bid and worked on 
in addition  even work that had been contracted for was sometimes deferred by the customer into the future 
in recent months  it appears the state and local government revenues have been improving  resulting in increased activity preparatory to the issuance of requests for new bids and ultimately  the company expects the awarding of new projects 
it appears to us that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery 
after the occurrence of the tragic events of the september  terrorist attacks  there was a general perception that our integrated electronic systems and attack protection segments would see a significant increase in order flow 
to the contrary  in the months subsequent to the terrorist attacks these segments saw a slowing in new work opportunities as the various federal agencies and other customers that are the usual source of their business slowed their procurement processes waiting for definitive direction as to how to proceed in the post september world 
now further complicated by the military action in iraq  the company s clients are reevaluating priorities and budgets and are funding only their most pressing demands while also making key decisions as to which projects can be deferred 
as a result of the above factors  during the last four years the company has experienced a more challenging marketplace than it experienced in the years prior to september  market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company entered into a fixed rate interest rate swap agreement on june  in the initial notional amount of million 
the notional amount of this swap agreement declined by thousand on a quarterly basis until it matured on september  in january the interest rate swap ceased to be a highly effective cash flow hedge when the related debt was repaid 
consequently  the amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income as changes in fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized in earnings for the year ended december  upon determination of the hedge ineffectiveness  the cumulative loss on the fair value of the interest rate swap was thousand  which was recognized in other expense 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was a gain of thousand 
on january   the company completed an offering of million principal amount of the notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company used a portion of the proceeds of this note offering to pay down outstanding borrowings under its variable rate bank notes 
subsequent to the pay down of its bank notes the only variable rate borrowing remaining outstanding at december  is approximately million of industrial revenue bonds 
since this borrowing bears interest at variable rates  and in the event interest rates increase dramatically  the increase in interest expense to the company could be material to the results of operations of the company
