item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on january  we acquired the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
historical financial and other information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to january  reflects the business of commscope prior to our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business  unless otherwise noted 
because the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business is significant to us  historical financial information for periods prior to the acquisition may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview commscope  inc is a world leader in the design and manufacture of cable and connectivity solutions for communications networks 
we focus on the last mile in communications networks  which is the distribution access  or final link to the customer 
through our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business of avaya on january   we became a global leader in structured cabling for business enterprise applications 
we believe we are a global leader in broadband coaxial cables for the cable television industry 
we are an industry leader in the design and manufacture of environmentally secure enclosures to integrate complex equipment for digital subscriber line dsl and fiber to the node fttn deployments by telecommunication service providers in the united states 
we also design  manufacture and market a broad line of high performance electronic  coaxial and fiber optic cable products for data networking  internet access  wireless communication  telephony and other broadband applications 
during  our operations were conducted within one reportable business segment  based on the similarity of products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environment 
during  as a result of the acquisition of connectivity solutions  management evaluated the results of operations in two reportable business segments the cable segment  which was the same as our cable business prior to the acquisition  and the connectivity solutions segment  which was the business acquired in january during  as a result of the continued integration of the connectivity solutions business into our global operations and financial reporting systems  management changed the reportable segments used to evaluate results of operations 
the new reportable segments are defined by major product category as follows enterprise  broadband and carrier 
information for prior periods has been restated based on the new segments 
net sales for increased by million or to  million as compared to  primarily due to strong sales growth internationally for our enterprise segment products and domestically for our carrier segment products as well as price increases for all of our major products 
operating income for increased to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in gross margin to during compared with during  a million recovery of accounts receivable that had previously been written off and various charges incurred during related to the connectivity solutions acquisition 
operating income for was negatively impacted by million in restructuring costs  a million increase over the restructuring costs recognized in net income of million for was lower than the million reported for despite the increase in operating income  primarily due to the gain million  after tax from the sale of our interest in ofs brightwave during during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the primary source of revenue from our enterprise segment was sales of structured cabling solutions to large  multinational companies  primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
the segment also includes coaxial cable for various video and data applications  other than cable television 
demand for enterprise segment products depends primarily on information technology spending by enterprises  such as communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings or campuses 
the primary source of revenue for our broadband segment was product sales to cable television system operators 
demand for our broadband segment products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television system operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenue for our carrier segment was sales of secure environmental enclosures for electronic devices and equipment 
these products are used by wireline and wireless telecommunication service providers carriers and may be sold directly to the carriers or to original equipment manufacturers oems providing equipment to such carriers 
the carrier segment also derives revenue from the sale of cables and components used by wireless providers to connect antennae to transmitters 
demand for carrier segment products depends primarily on capital spending by carriers to expand their distribution networks or increase the capacity of their networks 
our future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon global spending by business enterprises on information technology  investment by telecommunication companies in the communications infrastructure  overall global business conditions  our ability to manage costs successfully as we implement our global manufacturing initiatives  and the other factors set forth in item a of this form k 
our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures 
we have experienced significant increases in raw material prices during the past two years as a result of increased global demand and supply disruptions 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material prices through effective requirements planning  working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms and implementing price increases 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  cost increases could have a material effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
the following significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events 
it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s future estimates related to doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances and rebates and distributor price protection reserves we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in future reductions to revenue 
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
product warranty reserves we recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
the product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty five years from the date of sale  depending upon the product subject to the warranty 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates  as appropriate  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
income tax valuation allowances we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of deferred tax valuation allowances 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an increase to an income tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
impairment reviews management reviews intangible assets  investments and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected from these assets 
operating performance  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact estimates of expected future cash flows 
any impairment indicated by this analysis would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s prior estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are developed from actuarial valuations 
critical assumptions inherent in these valuations include the discount rate  health care cost trend rate  rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates 
assumptions are subject to change each year based on changes in market conditions and in management s assumptions about future events 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities

accordingly  the consolidated results for the year ended december  include the operating results of connectivity solutions for the eleven month period from february  through december  this information should be considered when comparing the financial results of and see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
net sales below is a summary that reflects our actual net sales by segment for the years ended december  and the net sales for the year ended december  incorporate the connectivity solutions net sales for the eleven month period from february  through december  this summary also reflects pro forma net sales for the year ended december   as if connectivity solutions had been acquired on january  the pro forma net sales of the connectivity solutions for the one month period ended january  are based on the historical results of the connectivity solutions business as operated by avaya during the periods presented and therefore may not be indicative of the actual results of the connectivity solutions business as operated by us 
actual inter segment sales eliminations for the eleven month period ended december  and pro forma inter segment sales eliminations for january are included below 
the table and discussion below compare net sales for the year ended december  to the pro forma net sales for the year ended december   since the actual net sales for the eleven months ended december  would not be comparable 
however  these pro forma results may not be indicative of the actual results of the connectivity solutions business as operated by us 
actual pro forma net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change dollars in millions enterprise broadband carrier inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales total domestic sales total international sales total worldwide sales overall  consolidated net sales increased during primarily due to strong growth in domestic ics and wireless product sales within the carrier segment and higher prices in response to higher raw material costs and modest sales growth in the enterprise and broadband segments 
enterprise segment the increase in net sales of enterprise segment products was primarily driven by improved international project business and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
we announced price increases for certain enterprise segment products during as a result of significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials and further increased prices in in response to continued raw material cost increases 
in addition  the launch during of our uniprise brand contributed to the increase in net sales 
domestic net sales volume of enterprise segment products in were modestly lower than  reflecting some limited customer acceptance of price increases 
during  systimax sales volume was negatively impacted by an effort to reduce external inventory balances held by distributors to a more appropriate level 
we believe that the overall improvement in the financial condition of our customers and the continued demand for networks to support increased bandwidth has and will continue to contribute to an increase in their information technology budgets 
if additional price increases in response to rising raw material costs are necessary  however  net sales could be adversely affected if customer acceptance is limited 
broadband segment the increase in net sales of broadband segment products for primarily resulted from the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
sales were also positively affected by expansion of international cable networks and the rebuilding of infrastructure damaged by the gulf coast hurricanes in the united states 
we believe that there are opportunities for continued international sales growth as a result of market deregulation and economic growth 
domestic spending by cable television system operators is largely limited to network maintenance  resulting in more limited growth opportunities 
in february  we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire certain of the assets supporting the trunk and distribution cable television products of trilogy communications  inc the acquisition  subject to due diligence and customary closing conditions  is expected to close during the first quarter of during the months ended september   the product lines being acquired had revenues of less than million 
carrier segment the ics product line generated the largest portion of the increase in carrier segment net sales for ics sales increased substantially due to sales to wireline carriers for dsl and fttn applications in the united states 
these carriers are expected to continue investing in high speed data and video services as they compete with cable and other providers of broadband capacity 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this investment  though the growth may be volatile as customer spending is mainly project driven 
sales of cell reach wireless products during nearly doubled from the improvement in general financial conditions of our customers and competition to provide increased network capacity and capabilities has led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we have developed relationships with certain new customers  who generally purchase larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
we believe we continue to make steady progress communicating the cell reach value proposition to new and existing customers  both domestically and internationally 
while we expect sales of wireless products to be somewhat volatile since customer spending is mainly project driven  we remain optimistic about our long term global wireless opportunities 
sales of exchangemax products decreased in due largely to weak demand for central office telecommunications equipment 
we have decided to exit the exchangemax twisted pair central office cable business as we believe that the outlook for improvements in this business is poor 
this business had net sales of approximately million during we plan to retain the exchangemax apparatus business and believe that it should achieve modest growth 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for increased by million to million and gross profit margin increased to compared to for these improvements reflect the impact of price increases implemented in response to increases in raw material costs  changes in the mix of products sold and cost reductions  including those resulting from the initiatives begun during the fourth quarter of at the csmi omaha facility 
gross profit margin for was adversely affected by the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on the connectivity solutions inventory 
these purchase accounting adjustments resulted from the write up of connectivity solutions finished goods and work in process inventory to reflect its acquired fair value as of the acquisition date 
this write up to fair value resulted in an increase of approximately million in cost of sales and lower margins following the connectivity solutions acquisition as the acquired inventory was sold 
the rising cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  plastics and other polymers  and steel increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we implemented price increases for certain products during and  which somewhat offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin 
we expect gross profit and gross profit margin to improve in  largely as a result of higher sales volume and cost savings  including those from the global manufacturing initiative begun in see restructuring costs below 
however  further increases in raw material costs as a result of rising commodity prices may reduce gross profit and gross profit margin if we are unable to achieve market acceptance of recently announced and future price increases 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million during and decreased as a percentage of net sales to during compared to during the increase in sg a is net of a million benefit related to recovery of accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional discussion of this recovery 
excluding the impact of the adelphia recovery  sg a as a percentage of net sales was for this adjusted percentage is lower than that for reflecting the impact of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of various costs incurred in associated with the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily related to developing new enterprise segment structured cabling solutions  cost effective designs for products within each of our segments and production modifications for certain enterprise and broadband segment products in order to be in a position to comply with new regulations governing the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacture of electronic equipment and components 
in process research and development charges we recognized a million pretax charge in for the write off of in process r d acquired in our acquisition of connectivity solutions 
this r d was valued as an intangible asset by independent appraisal in accordance with purchase accounting guidance 
since r d activities are required to be expensed as incurred under us generally accepted accounting principles  this acquired intangible asset was written off immediately following the acquisition date 
acquisition related transition and startup costs we incurred pretax charges of million during as a result of startup  transition and other costs related to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
these charges primarily related to information technology  transition activities and other acquisition related costs 
we reduced the connectivity solutions workforce by approximately employees  or of the global workforce  during the first quarter of the reductions were primarily related to our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost and primarily affected the enterprise segment 
we recorded net pretax charges of million in acquisition related transition and startup costs for employee termination benefits related to this workforce reduction 
restructuring costs we recognized million of pretax restructuring charges during  compared to million recognized during the charges included million related to global manufacturing initiatives adopted by the board of directors in august and million related to completing the organizational and cost reduction initiatives begun in at csmi  the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives are to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities and the expected closing of a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late charges incurred for the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs  million for equipment relocation costs and million for asset impairment charges 
the employee related costs include accruals for severance and related fringe benefits of million and million related to pension and other postemployment benefit curtailment and special termination benefit costs resulting from an early retirement offer made available to and accepted by certain employees 
severance and related fringe benefits are being accrued ratably over the period employees are obligated to provide services in order to receive benefits 
accordingly  additional pretax employee related charges of million to million are expected to be recognized in  predominantly in the first half of the year 
equipment relocation costs relate directly to shifting manufacturing capacity among our global manufacturing facilities and include costs to uninstall  pack  ship and re install equipment as well as the costs to prepare the receiving facility to accommodate the equipment 
these costs are recognized as the expenses are incurred and additional costs of million to million are expected to be recognized  primarily in asset impairment charges relate to production equipment that has been identified as excess  pending consolidation of certain production operations in other facilities 
it is anticipated that this equipment will be available for sale once the facility consolidation is complete 
the equipment has been recorded at its estimated net realizable value upon sale plus an estimate of its remaining utility while in service 
additional impairment charges may be incurred upon the disposition of these assets or if additional excess equipment is identified 
charges incurred during related to the organizational and cost reduction initiatives included million for process improvement costs  primarily consulting and other costs associated with modifying the manufacturing operations  and million for asset impairment charges related to equipment that was no longer in use  including million related to classifying a distribution facility as held for sale and reducing the carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
there was a million reversal of reserves for severance and related fringe benefits established in as a result of there being fewer reductions in personnel  due to higher than anticipated levels of business for certain products 
there are no further charges anticipated as a result of the organizational and cost reduction initiatives 
as a result of restructuring actions that have been completed and those that are in process  there is expected to be significant unutilized and underutilized space in our omaha facility 
we are evaluating alternatives for disposing of this excess space 
additional charges  which are not expected to be material  may be incurred in completing this process 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recognized a million pretax loss during on the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes 
this loss includes premiums paid and accrued to note holders of million and the write off of the remaining balance of related long term financing costs of million 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
net interest expense net interest expense during was million  compared to million during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the average interest rate on outstanding borrowing was essentially unchanged due to the reduction in the balance of our senior term note due to scheduled principal payments  offset by increases in the rate on the note due to increases in short term interest rates 
the reduction in net interest expense was primarily the result of increased interest income due to the larger invested balances in and higher short term interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
our tax provision includes the establishment of a million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses from one of our foreign subsidiaries and million related to establishing tax reserves for various prior year state income tax matters arising from tax audits  which are substantially offset by the release of million of previously established valuation allowances related to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
ofs brightwave  llc effective april   furukawa made additional equity investments in ofs brightwave and we elected not to make further corresponding investments in ofs brightwave 
as a result  our ownership percentage was reduced from to 
primarily as a result of the continuing weakness in the fiber optic cable market and furukawa s continuing efforts to restructure its ofs operations  we agreed with furukawa to further amend our existing contractual arrangements in the second quarter of for the mutual benefit of both companies 
on june   we agreed with furukawa to change the period in which we could exercise our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa from to any time on or after june  and changed the exercise price from million in cash to the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa 
on june   we exercised our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa in exchange for the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa  which had a fair value of million as of the transaction date 
we currently hold these shares as treasury stock 
as a result of this transaction  we no longer own any equity interest in ofs brightwave 
however  we maintained our strategic relationship with furukawa by entering into a four year optical fiber supply agreement with ofs fitel  llc fitel  a wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa  replacing the existing supply agreement with fitel that was scheduled to expire in november through this supply agreement  we continue to have access to a broad array of technologically advanced optical fibers 
we also have a cross license arrangement with a subsidiary of furukawa for key intellectual property 
the ofs brightwave transaction resulted in a net pretax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share during this gain represents the fair value of the common stock received by us in exchange for the transfer of our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa  plus the realized gain from our cumulative equity method share of ofs brightwave s unrealized foreign currency translation gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  less an million impairment charge related to fully impairing a million note receivable from ofs brightwave 
this transaction does not affect our right to receive full payment from ofs brightwave under the million note due in november  based on its original terms 
we have continued to receive quarterly interest payments in accordance with the terms of the note 
our share of the losses of ofs brightwave for the period from january  through june  was million  pretax 
we realized a tax benefit related to our share of the losses of million in outlook we are encouraged about the global outlook for our products 
we believe market conditions for the enterprise and broadband segments should support modest revenue growth in  primarily due to slight increases in global sales volume and higher sales prices 
we anticipate higher sales prices for many of our products due to the ongoing increases in the cost of raw materials such as copper  aluminum and plastics 
carrier segment sales are expected to grow faster than our other segments as certain wireline and wireless operators upgrade their communications networks 
we are dependent upon continued spending for maintenance of existing infrastructure and ongoing capital investment by our customers in order to achieve an increase in sales 
we expect operating income to increase during  primarily due to higher sales volumes and ongoing cost reduction 
our previously announced global manufacturing initiatives should also support improved profitability in  primarily in the second half of the year 
however  rising raw materials costs remain a risk to operating margin

actual pro forma net sales of net sales net sales of net sales net sales of net sales dollar change change dollars in millions enterprise broadband carrier inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales total domestic sales total international sales total worldwide sales overall  consolidated net sales  on a pro forma basis  increased during primarily due to an increase in international sales of broadband segment products and domestic sales of enterprise segment products 
in addition  improving business conditions and continuing benefits of deregulation in selected international markets contributed to the overall increase in net sales of our broadband segment products 
as the economic environment improved during  companies increased capital spending 
enterprise segment the net sales of enterprise segment products were moderately higher during primarily due to strong domestic sales volumes driven by improved project business and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
during the first quarter of  we announced two price increases for certain products on new projects  primarily due to the rising cost of copper and certain polymers 
during the first half of  systimax sales volume was negatively impacted by an effort to reduce external inventory balances held by distributors to a more appropriate level 
during the second half of  the systimax product line reported strong sales  which more than offset the impact of the first half weak sales growth 
in addition  the launch of our uniprise brand contributed to the increase in net sales of enterprise segment products 
broadband segment the increase in net sales of broadband segment products for primarily resulted from strong international sales volumes and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
despite lower sales of fiber optic cable and lower sales to our largest domestic broadband segment customer  sales of broadband segment products increased moderately during due to price increases  higher international sales related in part to deregulation in selected markets and reconstruction related to certain storms that occurred in the southeastern us carrier segment the increase in net sales of carrier segment products was mainly due to a higher volume of sales  primarily in wireless and ics products in domestic markets 
the improvement in general financial conditions of our customers has led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we have developed relationships with certain new customers  who generally purchase larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
we believe we continue to make steady progress communicating the cell reach value proposition to new and existing customers  both domestically and internationally 
while we expect sales of wireless products to be somewhat volatile since customer spending is mainly project driven  we remain optimistic about our long term global wireless opportunities 
the increase in ics net sales for was primarily due to increased sales volumes resulting from increasing service provider dsl deployments 
the improvement in wireless and ics sales was somewhat offset by the decrease in net sales of exchangemax products for this decrease was primarily related to the continued impact of competitive pricing pressure and weak demand for central office telecommunications equipment 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit increased by million to million  primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
gross profit margin increased to during compared to during  primarily due to the contribution of the connectivity solutions systimax products  as these products generated higher margins  on average  than our other products 
gross profit margin for was adversely affected by the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on the connectivity solutions inventory 
these purchase accounting adjustments resulted from the write up of connectivity solutions finished goods and work in process inventory to reflect its acquired fair value as of the acquisition date 
this write up to fair value resulted in an increase of approximately million in cost of sales and lower margins following the connectivity solutions acquisition as the acquired inventory was sold 
the rising cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  plastics and other polymers  and steel also increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we announced price increases for certain products during  which somewhat offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin during selling  general and administrative expense sg a expenses increased by million to million during  primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to of net sales during compared to of net sales during in addition to costs associated with the acquisition  the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by increases in sales and marketing expenses to bring new products to market and to market existing product groups 
additional increases in sg a were primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs  insurance costs  professional fees related to new regulatory requirements  and travel costs 
research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily due to the acquisition of connectivity solutions  which involves more extensive research and development activities than our business prior to the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition of connectivity solutions  we gained over r d professionals who focus on fundamental research  product development and enhancements  and manufacturing processes related to connectivity solutions products 
during  we incurred r d costs primarily related to developing new enterprise segment structured cabling solutions as well as cost effective designs for cables  apparatus and cabinets 
impairment charges for fixed assets during the fourth quarter of  million of fixed asset impairment charges were recognized as a component of the restructuring costs incurred in connection with the cost reduction initiatives at csmi s omaha facility see restructuring costs below 
during the second quarter of  as a result of the difficult global business environment in telecommunications and an ongoing decline in demand  both domestically and internationally  and reduced export sales from our brazilian operation  we determined that certain domestic and brazilian manufacturing fixed assets were impaired 
accordingly  we obtained third party appraisals of the majority of these specifically identified assets to determine their fair values and the resulting amount of impairment charges to be recognized 
in total  we recognized pretax impairment charges as follows in millions domestic broadband segment cable manufacturing assets brazilian broadband segment cable manufacturing assets brazilian carrier segment cable manufacturing assets other domestic manufacturing assets total impairment charges in process research and development charges we recognized a million pretax charge in for the write off of in process r d acquired in our acquisition of connectivity solutions 
this r d was valued as an intangible asset by independent appraisal in accordance with purchase accounting guidance 
since r d activities are required to be expensed as incurred under us generally accepted accounting principles  this acquired intangible asset was written off immediately following the acquisition date  with subsequent adjustments and write offs resulting from changes in the purchase price allocation 
acquisition related transition and startup costs we incurred pretax charges of million during as a result of startup  transition and other costs related to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
these charges primarily related to information technology  transition activities and other acquisition related costs 
we reduced the connectivity solutions workforce by approximately employees  or of the global workforce  during the first quarter of the reductions were primarily related to our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost and primarily affected the enterprise segment 
we recorded net pretax charges of approximately million in acquisition related transition and startup costs for employee termination benefits related to this workforce reduction 
restructuring costs we recognized a million pretax charge for restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of related to organizational and cost reduction initiatives at csmi s omaha  nebraska facility 
csmi s omaha facility is utilized in the enterprise and carrier segments and was acquired on january  as part of the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
the charge consisted of million of employee related costs  including severance pay and related fringe benefits and a net pension plan curtailment loss  million of impairment charges related to manufacturing equipment that is no longer used in operations  and million of process improvement costs related to consulting and other costs associated with modifying the manufacturing operations 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recognized a million pretax loss during on the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes 
this loss includes premiums paid and accrued to note holders of million and the write off of the remaining balance of related long term financing costs of million 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
net interest expense net interest expense during was million  compared to million during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  although our average interest rate decreased  net interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding balances of long term debt  incurred primarily for the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
the decrease in the effective interest rate was primarily due to the refinancing in march and april of our then existing million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes with the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
in conjunction with our connectivity solutions acquisition  we significantly increased the number of international locations in which we conduct business 
ofs brightwave  llc effective april   furukawa made additional equity investments in ofs brightwave and we elected not to make further corresponding investments in ofs brightwave 
as a result  our ownership percentage was reduced from to 
primarily as a result of the continuing weakness in the fiber optic cable market and furukawa s continuing efforts to restructure its ofs operations  we agreed with furukawa to further amend our existing contractual arrangements in the second quarter of for the mutual benefit of both companies 
on june   we agreed with furukawa to change the period in which we could exercise our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa from to any time on or after june  and changed the exercise price from million in cash to the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa 
on june   we exercised our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa in exchange for the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa  which had a fair value of million as of the transaction date 
we currently hold these shares as treasury stock 
as a result of this transaction  we no longer own any equity interest in ofs brightwave 
however  we maintained our strategic relationship with furukawa by entering into a four year optical fiber supply agreement with ofs fitel  llc fitel  a wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa  replacing the existing supply agreement with fitel that was scheduled to expire in november through this supply agreement  we continue to have access to a broad array of technologically advanced optical fibers 
we also have a cross license arrangement with a subsidiary of furukawa for key intellectual property 
the ofs brightwave transaction resulted in a net pretax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share during this gain represents the fair value of the common stock received by us in exchange for the transfer of our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa  plus the realized gain from our cumulative equity method share of ofs brightwave s unrealized foreign currency translation gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  less an million impairment charge related to fully impairing a million note receivable from ofs brightwave 
this transaction does not affect our right to receive full payment from ofs brightwave under the million note due in november  based on its original terms 
our share of the losses of ofs brightwave for the period from january  through june  was million  pretax  compared to million during the results reflected the impact of impairment charges for certain fixed assets and intangible assets  restructuring and employee separation costs 
we realized a tax benefit related to our share of the losses of million in and million in liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview our principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under credit facilities 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings 
dollar change change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and current portion of long term debt capital expenditures long term debt  including current portion book capital structure long term debt as a percentage of book capital structure the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  was primarily the result of cash flow from operations 
the increase also reflects proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by capital expenditures and scheduled principal repayments on our long term debt 
the reduction in cash flow from operations and the increase in working capital were primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable attributable to a change in credit terms  implemented in january for certain customers to reduce the prompt payment discount and higher inventory balances resulting from higher sales volumes and increased raw materials costs 
our long term debt as a percent of book capital structure decreased during primarily due to the increase in book capital from net earnings and issuance of common stock as a result of stock option exercises and the decrease in long term debt of million as a result of scheduled principal repayments 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased year over year primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable resulting from the change in credit terms as well as higher inventory levels resulting from higher sales volumes and increased raw material costs 
in addition  we also paid million in income taxes in  compared to million in we expect to generate net cash from operations during primarily due to improved margins from sales of certain product groups and the impact of our cost reduction efforts 
investing activities our investment in property  plant and equipment was higher during primarily due to capital spending related to cost reduction efforts and additional production capability in asia  including completing the construction of a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china and beginning an expansion of that facility 
we expect total capital expenditures to remain at a level below consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the next several years 
financing activities on january   in connection with our acquisition of connectivity solutions  we replaced our then existing million secured credit facility with a new million senior secured credit facility 
this new senior secured credit facility is comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility and is secured by substantially all of our assets  is guaranteed by all of our material domestic subsidiaries and contains certain financial and restrictive covenants 
the balance outstanding under the term loan facility as of december  was million and is required to be repaid by us in consecutive quarterly installments of million with a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest on december  we had availability under the new revolving credit facility of million and had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  our ability to borrow under this revolving credit facility depends on the amount of our borrowing base  which is determined as specified percentages of our eligible receivables and inventory  reduced for certain reserves and the total amount of letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under this senior secured credit facility as of december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of this senior secured credit facility 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures due march  the proceeds from these debentures were used primarily to extinguish our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due december   to repay million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and for general corporate purposes 
we repurchased or redeemed all of our convertible subordinated notes during march and april the repurchase and redemption of these notes resulted in a million pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of these debentures 
future cash needs we expect that our primary future cash needs will be to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and employee benefit obligations 
we expect to make up to million in voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plans during and that these noncurrent employee benefit liabilities will be funded with cash flows from future operations 
in february  we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement with trilogy communications  inc trilogy to acquire certain assets supporting trilogy s mc ohm trunk and distribution cable television products business and certain other assets 
this transaction  which is subject to due diligence and customary closing conditions  is expected to close during the first quarter of and we expect to fund the purchase price of approximately million  subject to certain inventory adjustments  from existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs 
we may  from time to time  borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities  if market conditions are favorable  to meet our future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs

the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics and other polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially over the last two years 
as a result  we have significantly increased our prices for certain products and may have to increase prices again in the future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales  these cost increases could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations upon final disposition

newly issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement is the result of efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage and rehandling costs be recognized as expenses in the current period 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company in application of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes standards related to the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this revised standard also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of these equity instruments 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the company has elected the modified prospective method of transition to sfas no 
r  which will be effective in as part of this transition  the company will recognize compensation expense related to future stock option and other share based compensation grants immediately for grantees who are retirement eligible rather than continue the current practice employed in the statement of operations and in the pro forma footnote disclosure that recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period regardless of the retirement eligibility of grantees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments that may be used by us include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as fabricated aluminum  plastics and other polymers  bimetals  copper and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products have resulted in  and may continue to result in  higher overall production costs 
approximately and of our and net sales  respectively  were to customers located outside the us although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from some of our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement  which hedges a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary and a portion of our other euro denominated asset exposure 
settlement of the fair value of this hedging instrument as of december  and would have resulted in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
the portion of these unrealized losses that relates to the hedge of our belgian subsidiary is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss while the remainder of the unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
our non derivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debentures  which were recorded in the financial statements at million and had a fair value of million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal  interest and net settlement cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for each year represent the rate effective for the related loan or derivative instrument as of the date of the table 
the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due 
the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures at any time on or after march  at of the principal amount plus accrued interest  the holders option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures on march   march  and march  for of the principal amount plus accrued interest  or the holders right to convert the debenture into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k
