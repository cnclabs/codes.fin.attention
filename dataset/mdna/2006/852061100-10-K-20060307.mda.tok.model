item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations segmental results of operations wireless for more information regarding the financial performance of our wireless segment 
strategy our strategy for the wireless segment is to utilize state of the art technology to provide differentiated wireless services and applications in order to acquire and retain high quality wireless subscribers 
to enable us to offer innovative applications and services  we are deploying high speed ev do technology across our cdma network 
the services supported by this technology  marketed as powervision  give consumer and business subscribers with ev do enabled devices access to numerous sophisticated data messaging  imaging  entertainment and location based applications 
on our iden network  we continue to develop features and services that are designed to meet the needs of business and government customers  with a particular focus on services that build upon our walkie talkie features 
to offer customers all of the benefits of powervision and our walkie talkie features  we expect to introduce a dual mode handset designed to operate on both our cdma and iden network platforms 
we also seek to realize operating efficiencies in our business  in part from merger related synergies  and optimize the performance of our network while minimizing costs 
products and services we offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and data transmission services and features in a variety of pricing plans  including prepaid service plans 
our wireless mobile voice communications services include basic local and long distance wireless voice services  as well as voicemail  call waiting  three way calling  caller identification  directory assistance  call forwarding  speakerphone and voice activated dialing features 
through a variety of roaming arrangements  we provide roaming services to areas in over countries outside the united states  including areas of asia  including china  guam  hong kong  taiwan and thailand  new zealand  canada  central and south america  including argentina  bolivia  chile  ecuador  guatemala  mexico  paraguay  peru  uruguay and venezuela  and most major caribbean islands 
the data communications services include wireless imaging  including the ability to shoot and send digital still pictures and video clips from a wireless handset  wireless data communications  including internet access and messaging and email services  on our cdma network  wireless entertainment  including the ability to view live television  listen to sirius satellite radio  download and listen to music from our sprint music store sm  a music catalogue with thousands of songs from virtually every music genre  and play games with full color graphics and polyphonic sounds all from a wireless handset  and location based  asset and fleet management  and dispatch services

also  through agreements with third parties  subscribers with iden devices can communicate instantly with our walkie talkie feature to and from selected areas in canada  latin america and mexico 
our walkie talkie features offer subscribers instant communications in a variety of other ways  including push to email applications that allow a user to send a streaming voice message to an email recipient  and off network walkie talkie communications available on certain handsets 
our services are provided using a wide variety of handsets and personal computer wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services 
we generally sell our handsets at prices below our cost in response to competition  to attract new customers and as retention inducements for existing customers 
we also sell accessories  such as carrying cases  hands free devices  batteries  battery chargers and other items to consumers  and we sell handsets and accessories to agents and other third party distributors for resale 
we also offer wholesale services on our cdma network to resellers  commonly known as mobile virtual network operators  or mvnos 
mvnos purchase wireless services from us at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers under their own brand names 
these companies bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
we currently provide wholesale services  through multi year  exclusive wholesale agreements  to a number to mvnos  including qwest communications international  inc  disney and espn 
we also provide wholesale services to virgin mobile usa  which offers prepaid wireless service targeted to the youth and prepaid markets  and is a joint venture between us and the virgin group 
as of december   the number of subscribers served through resellers represented approximately of the total subscribers served by our cdma network 
we offer customized design  development  implementation and support services for wireless services provided to large companies and government agencies 
we also recently entered into a joint venture with several cable companies to develop converged next generation products for consumers designed to combine many of cable s core products and interactive features with wireless technology to deliver a broad range of services  including video  wireless voice and data services  high speed internet and cable phone service 
sales and marketing we focus the marketing and sales of wireless services on two targeted groups of customers individuals  and businesses and government agencies 
we offer a variety of pricing options and plans  including plans designed specifically for business customers  and individuals and families 
we use a variety of sales channels to attract new subscribers of wireless services  including direct sales representatives whose efforts are focused on marketing and selling cdma and iden based wireless services primarily to mid sized to large businesses and government agencies that value our industry and technical expertise and extensive product and service portfolio  as well as our ability to develop custom communications capabilities that meet the specific needs of these larger customers  retail outlets that focus on sales to the consumer market  including radio shack  best buy  target  wal mart and sprint nextel retail stores  indirect sales agents that primarily consist of local and national non affiliated dealers and independent contractors that market and sell services to small businesses and the consumer market  and are generally paid through commissions  and customer convenient channels  including web sales and telesales 
we market our post paid services under the sprint and nextel brands 
we offer these services on a contract basis typically for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile brand  as a means to directly target the youth and prepaid wireless service markets 
although we market our services using traditional print and television advertising  we also provide exposure to our brand names and wireless services through various sponsorships 
we are the title sponsor of the nascar nextel cup series tm  the national association for stock car auto racing  or nascar  premier national championship series 
we are nascar s official telecommunications sponsor  which entitles us to a variety of branding  advertising  merchandising and technology related opportunities  many of which are exclusive with nascar  its drivers and teams  and the racetrack facilities 
we also are the official telecommunications service provider of the national football league  or nfl  and the provider of exclusive and original nfl related content as part of our sprint branded wireless service 
we also have been the exclusive sponsor of a number of nfl events  including the super bowl xl half time show 
the goal of these initiatives  together with our other marketing initiatives  which include affiliations with most major sports leagues  is to increase brand awareness in our targeted customer base and expand the use of our customer convenient distribution channels web sales  telesales and retail stores 
wireless network technologies cdma network we provide our sprint branded wireless services over our cdma network  an all digital wireless network with spectrum licenses that allow us to provide service to the entire united states population  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
the cdma network uses a single frequency band and a digital spread spectrum wireless technology that allows a large number of users to access a single frequency band by assigning a code to all voice and data bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded bits over the air and reassembling the voice and data into its original format 
we supplement the cdma network through commercial affiliation arrangements with the pcs affiliates 
under these arrangements  the pcs affiliates offer wireless services under the sprint brand on cdma networks built and operated at their own expense 
in most instances  the pcs affiliates use spectrum licensed to  and controlled by  us 
following the acquisitions of us unwired  gulf coast wireless  and iwo holdings  completed in  and the acquisitions of alamosa and enterprise communications completed in early  there are five remaining pcs affiliates with networks that collectively serve markets where about million people live or work 
we  together with the pcs affiliates  operate cdma networks in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas  that reach where a quarter billion people live and work 
we provide nationwide service through a combination of operating our own digital network in both major and smaller us metropolitan areas  and rural connecting routes using cdma technology  affiliating under commercial arrangements with the remaining pcs affiliates  each of which operates a cdma network  mainly in and around smaller us metropolitan areas  roaming on other providers analog cellular networks using multi mode and multi band handsets  and roaming on other providers digital networks that use cdma 
cdma subscribers can use their phones through roaming agreements in countries other than the united states  including areas of asia  including china  guam  hong kong  taiwan and thailand  new zealand  canada  central and south america  including argentina  bolivia  chile  ecuador  guatemala  mexico  paraguay  peru  uruguay and venezuela  and most major caribbean islands 
we are in the process of deploying the high speed ev do technology across our cdma network 
with peak rates of up to megabits per second for downloads  ev do increases average mobile device data speeds up to times faster when compared to the prior generation technology 
in addition  this technology delivers superior application and service performance on ev do capable handsets and laptops equipped with ev do enabled sprint pcs connection cards 
the services supported by this technology  marketed as powervision  give consumer and business customers access to numerous sophisticated applications using ev do enabled devices  including data messaging  imaging  entertainment and location based applications 
we first introduced ev do commercially in the second quarter  and at december  ev do was deployed in markets where about half of the us population lives or works 
we will continue to introduce ev do in additional markets in the cell site equipment used in the cdma network resides on space on communications towers 
although we own many of these towers  in may  we closed a transaction whereby we provided global signal inc with the exclusive rights to lease or operate more than  of our communication towers for a negotiated lease term that is the greater of the remaining terms of the underlying ground leases or up to years  assuming successful re negotiation of the underlying ground leases at the end of their current lease terms 
we have committed to sublease space from global signal on approximately  of these towers for a minimum of ten years 
we have erected additional communications towers to expand the capacity and coverage of our cdma network 
the acquisition of nextel has given us access to cell site communications towers erected for use in connection with the nextel iden network  which in many cases will enable us to co locate cdma cell site equipment on these towers  instead of requiring us to erect new towers or co locate the equipment on towers owned by third parties  which we expect will reduce our costs 
similarly  we will also be able to co locate iden cell site equipment on the cdma communications towers 
iden network we provide our nextel post paid and boost mobile prepaid wireless services over our iden network 
our iden network is an all digital packet data network based on iden wireless technology provided by motorola  inc we  together with nextel partners  are the only national wireless service provider in the us that utilizes iden technology  and  generally  the iden handsets that we currently offer are not enabled to roam onto wireless networks that do not utilize iden technology 
we  together with nextel partners  operate iden networks that serve of the top us markets where about million people live or work 
nextel partners provides digital wireless communications services under the nextel brand name in mid sized and tertiary us markets  and has the right to operate in of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the united states ranked by population 
as discussed above  we will acquire nextel partners when the required regulatory approvals are obtained 
we have roaming or interoperability agreements with iden based wireless service providers that operate in latin america and canada 
we have entered into interoperability agreements with nii holdings  inc  which provides for coordination of customer identification and validation necessary to facilitate roaming between our domestic markets and nii holdings latin american markets 
we also have roaming agreements in effect with telus mobility  inc in canadian market areas where it offers iden based services 
with the i iden handset  subscribers can roam in areas of over countries 
in addition  any iden subscriber can remove the subscriber identity module cards found in each iden handset and place them in certain motorola handsets that utilize global system for mobile communication  or gsm  technology  the network technology utilized by many wireless providers throughout europe and other parts of the world 
although the iden technology offers a number of advantages over other technology platforms  including the ability to offer our walkie talkie features  unlike other wireless technologies  it is a proprietary technology that relies solely on our and motorola s efforts for further research  and product development and innovation 
we rely on motorola to provide us with technology improvements designed to expand our iden based wireless voice capacity and improve our services 
motorola provides all of the iden infrastructure equipment used in the iden network  and substantially all iden handset devices  under agreements that set the prices we must pay to purchase and license this equipment  as well as a structure to develop new features and make long term improvements to our network 
motorola also provides integration services in connection with the deployment of iden network elements 
we have also agreed to warranty and maintenance programs and specified indemnity arrangements with motorola 
motorola is and is expected to continue to be our sole source supplier of iden infrastructure and iden handsets  except blackberry devices  which are manufactured by research in motion  or rim 
see item a 
risk factors if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our nextel branded services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our operations will be adversely affected 
competition we believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price  the types of services offered and quality of service 
we compete with a number of wireless carriers  including three other national wireless companies cingular wireless  verizon wireless and t mobile 
we also compete with regional providers of mobile wireless services  such as alltel corporation 
competition will increase to the extent that new firms enter the market as additional radio spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of other technologies and services that are developed and introduced in the future  including potentially those using unlicensed spectrum  including wireless fidelity  or wifi 
the continued addition of mvnos also contributes to increased competition 
although pricing is an important factor in potential customers purchase decisions  we believe that our targeted customers are also likely to base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to get things done quickly and efficiently 
we believe we compete based on our differentiated service offerings and products  including our powervision applications and push to talk walkie talkie feature 
several of our competitors have introduced high speed data  imaging  entertainment and location based services and walkie talkie type features that are designed to compete with our differentiated products and services 
other competitors have announced plans to introduce similar services 
if our competitors are able to provide applications and features that are comparable to ours  any competitive advantage from the differentiation of our services from those of our competitors would be reduced 
to the extent that the competitive environment requires us to decrease prices or increase service and product offerings  our revenue could decline or our costs could increase 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings also may adversely impact customer retention

risk factors we face intense competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
long distance through our long distance segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services targeted to domestic business and residential customers  multinational corporations and other communications companies 
as one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services  we operate all digital long distance and tier ip networks 
the financial performance for our long distance segment for  and is summarized as follows year ended december  in millions net operating revenues operating income loss see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations segmental results of operations long distance for more information regarding the financial performance of the long distance segment 
strategy in order to maintain market share in an increasingly competitive long distance communications environment  our long distance segment focuses on expanding its presence in the data communications markets by utilizing our principal strategic assets our high capacity national fiber optic network  our tier ip network  our base of business and residential customers  our established national brand and offerings available from our other operating entities 
products and services through our long distance segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services  including domestic and international voice and data communications using various protocols such as next generation mpls technologies  as well as ip  atm  frame relay and managed network services 
we also provide services to cable companies that resell our long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities 
although we continue to provide voice services to consumers  we no longer actively market those services 
in  we sold our dial ip business  a data service that was focused largely on the consumer market 
competition our long distance segment competes with at t  verizon  level  other major local incumbent operating companies  cable operators and other telecommunications providers in all segments of the long distance communications market 
some competitors are targeting the high end data market and are offering deeply discounted rates in exchange for high volume traffic as they attempt to fill their networks 
in addition  we face increasing competition from other wireless and ip based service providers 
many carriers are competing in the residential and small business markets by offering bundled packages of both local and long distance services 
competition in long distance is based on price and pricing plans  the types of services offered  customer service  and communications quality  reliability and availability 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and pricing strategies

local our local segment primarily provides regulated incumbent local phone services in local service territories in states 
at december   we provided these services to approximately million access lines  with our largest presence in florida  north carolina  nevada and ohio 
through this segment  we provide local voice  long distance and data services  including dsl  to customers located within our local service territories  access by consumers and other carriers to the local network  sales of telecommunications equipment  and other services within specified calling areas to residential and business customers 
we also provide wireless and video services to customers in our local service territories through agency relationships 
our wholesale telecommunications product distribution business  known as sprint north supply company  or north supply  also is part of the local segment 
we plan to spin off the local segment to our shareholders on a tax free basis in the second quarter the financial performance for our local segment for  and is summarized as follows year ended december  in millions net operating revenues operating income see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations segmental results of operations local for more information regarding the financial performance of the local segment 
strategy the strategy of our local segment is to sell a bundled package of products and services to meet the needs of our consumer and business and wholesale customers within our local service territories 
to enable us to meet these needs  we offer a wide array of products and services that we bundle in a variety of packages 
products and services we offer customers a wide array of voice  data and other services 
our voice services include local calling services to consumers and business customers within our local service territories  generally for a fixed monthly charge  and a variety of enhanced calling features  such as call forwarding  caller identification  voicemail and call waiting  for which we generally charge an additional monthly fee 
we also offer switched access services to long distance carriers  wireless carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  known as clecs  to enable them to connect their networks to customer locations 
as required by regulations of the federal communications commission  or fcc  we offer clecs the use of unbundled network facilities and the ability to co locate some of their equipment in our central offices 
we offer high speed internet access  primarily using a dsl service delivery platform 
we also offer large businesses  long distance carriers  wireless carriers and clecs dedicated circuits to connect their sites or networks to our network  their customers locations or other network facilities 
we offer customers within our local service territories long distance voice  data and wireless services using the networks and facilities of our wireless and long distance segments 
we also offer video services through a sales agency relationship with echostar communications corporation 
in addition  we sell service communications equipment that resides at a business customer s location for management of voice and data networks and applications 
we also procure  configure and distribute equipment  materials and supplies to many communication service providers 
sales and marketing we locally manage our service offerings in an effort to serve the needs of each customer  and have sales representatives with local market knowledge relevant to the service territories in which we operate 
we operate approximately retail stores and two wholesale call centers  located mainly in our local service territories 
we also have automated many of our customer service functions  including internet e commerce systems  so that our customers can receive answers to many frequently asked questions regarding their communications services without speaking to a customer service representative 
local network the network utilized by our local segment consists of host and remote central office digital switches and digital loop carriers interconnected with copper  microwave and fiber facilities 
our equipment typically operates on the most current software in generally available release 
the outside plant infrastructure connecting the customer with the core network also consists of a mix of copper and fiber optic cables 
competition there is widespread competition among wireline communications services providers 
the traditional dividing lines between local  long distance  wireless  video and internet services are becoming increasingly blurred 
we face competition from alternative communication systems constructed by facilities based clecs 
we also face increasing competition from cable operators providing high speed internet services  which can be used as a platform to support voice services utilizing voice over ip technology  or voip 
furthermore  wireless communications services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition  as some customers have chosen to forgo use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless services 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the rapid deployment of new technologies  products and services 
see item a 
risk factors we face intense competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
legislative and regulatory developments overview communications services are regulated both at the federal level by the fcc and at the state level by public utilities commissions  or pucs 
in general  incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  such as embarq  are subject to the most extensive regulation 
regulation covers not only rates and service terms  but also the terms on which ilecs provide connections and network elements to clecs 
long distance providers  such as us with respect to our long distance segment  are subject to less regulation  but still must comply with various statutory requirements and regulations 
the communications act of  or communications act  preempts states from regulating the rates of commercial mobile radio service  or cmrs  providers  such as us with respect to our wireless segment  but cmrs providers are subject to various licensing and technical requirements imposed by the fcc  including provisions related to the acquisition  assignment or transfer of radio licenses 
the fcc also imposes mandates on cmrs providers  such as those that require cmrs providers to transmit the telephone number and certain location information of someone calling to the appropriate dispatch center  and to allow customers to retain existing telephone numbers when switching from one communications carrier to another 
although the communications act preempts state regulation of cmrs rates and entry of cmrs providers  cmrs providers are subject to state authority over terms and conditions of service  such as certain billing practices and other consumer related matters 
the following summary of the regulatory environment in which our business operates does not describe all present and proposed federal  state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry 
some legislation and regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proceedings that could change the manner in which our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or their potential impact on our business 
see item a 
risk factors government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
regulation in the communications industry is subject to rapid changes  any of which could have an adverse effect on us in the future 
the following discussion describes some of the major communications related regulations that affect us  but numerous other substantive areas of regulation not discussed here may also influence our business 
wireline operations competitive local service the telecommunications act of  or telecom act  the first comprehensive update of the communications act  was designed to promote competition  and it eliminated legal and regulatory barriers to entry into local and long distance communications markets 
it also required ilecs to allow resale of specified local services at wholesale rates  negotiate interconnection agreements  provide nondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements  or unes  and allow co location of interconnection equipment by competitors 
the rules implementing the telecom act remain subject to legal challenges 
thus  the scope of future local competition remains uncertain 
these local competition rules impact us because we provide communications services as an ilec to approximately of the access lines in the united states  which represents the substantial part of the operations of our local segment 
in march  the fcc implemented an order that terminated the obligation of ilecs to offer a platform of unes to clecs after a one year transition period 
the order  which has been challenged  has led our long distance segment to discontinue its use of the unbundled element platforms 
ilecs generally have benefited from this order 
competitors in the service territories of our local segment generally have not made extensive use of their unbundled element platforms 
during  we entered into agreements with major cable television companies to provide communications and back office services to enable the cable companies to provide competitive local and long distance telephony services in a voip format to their end user customers 
certain ilecs have taken steps that have impeded our ability to provide services to the cable companies in an efficient manner 
access charge reform and universal service requirements intercarrier compensation includes interstate and intrastate switched access charges that ilecs  including our local segment  are entitled to receive from long distance carriers  including our long distance segment  for origination and termination of long distance calls  and reciprocal compensation that interconnected local carriers pay to each other for terminating interconnected local wireline and wireless calls 
in addition  ilecs  including our local segment  receive special access charges for providing dedicated facilities to other carriers and businesses 
on average  intrastate switched access rates  which are currently regulated by pucs  are substantially higher than interstate switched access charges  which are regulated by the fcc  and in turn interstate switched access charges are substantially higher than reciprocal compensation 
special access services are a significant cost for our wireless and long distance segments 
in  the fcc began a proceeding to determine whether access charges  as well as reciprocal compensation for local interconnected calls  should be replaced 
proposals include a bill and keep system under which intercarrier compensation would be eliminated and all carriers would recover their costs solely from end user customers  a unified intercarrier compensation system  in which the same rates would apply to all forms of intercarrier compensation ie  interstate and intrastate switched access and reciprocal compensation  and phased reductions in intercarrier compensation charges to a low  uniform level  except in certain rural areas over three years 
this proceeding remains pending with the fcc  and it is difficult to predict the changes that might result or their timing and impact 
in january  the fcc initiated a proceeding to examine the appropriate regulatory framework for the rates charged for special access services provided by ilecs to long distance  wireless and other carriers 
these services typically connect large business customers to long distance carriers networks and are used by wireless carriers to connect their switches to their cell sites 
the fcc is considering reforms to modify or eliminate special access pricing flexibility  and additional reforms to the price cap rules affecting special access pricing 
this proceeding could affect the amount our local segment charges for special access and the amount our long distance and wireless segments pay for the special access services they use 
in addition to the intercarrier compensation regime  many communications carriers receive revenues from the universal service funds  or usf  established by the fcc and many states 
the federal usf program provides funding for services provided in high cost areas  for reduced rate services to low income consumers  and for discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
these programs impact all three of our business segments because the usf is funded largely from assessments on communications carriers  who must make contributions into the fund 
we are a net payor into the federal usf  although we do receive some funding for both our local and wireless segments 
the fcc is considering changing the way it distributes this support to carriers  and its actions could adversely affect our eligibility to receive support or reduce the amount of support we currently receive 
in particular  fcc actions could make it more difficult for our wireless segment  currently receiving support in states as an eligible telecommunications carrier  or etc  to qualify for and to receive support 
further restrictions on our etc status at the federal and state levels could result in the rescission of our etc status 
our contributions to the federal usf are based on an fcc prescribed percentage of our interstate and international end user revenues from telecommunications services  including from our wireless and wireline segments 
the fcc is considering changing the interstate revenue based assessment in whole or in part with an assessment based on telephone numbers or connections to the public network 
voice over internet protocol with the increasing availability of voip services  the fcc has and continues to consider the regulatory status of various forms of voip 
in  the fcc issued an order finding that one form of voip  involving a specific form of computer to computer services for which no charge is assessed and conventional telephone numbers are not used  is an unregulated information service  rather than a telecommunications service  and preempted state regulation of this service 
the fcc also ruled that long distance offerings in which calls begin and end on the ordinary public switched telephone network  but are transmitted in part through the use of ip  are telecommunications services  thereby rendering the services subject to all the regulatory obligations imposed on ordinary long distance services  including payment of access charges and contributions to universal service funds 
in addition  the fcc preempted states from exercising entry and related economic regulation of volp services that do not use conventional phone numbers and that originate through the use of broadband connections and specialized customer premises equipment 
however  this ruling  which has been appealed in the courts  did not address specifically whether this form of voip is an information service or a telecommunications service  or what regulatory obligations  such as intercarrier compensation and usf contributions  should apply 
these issues surrounding how retail voip offerings should be regulated if at all  including whether they should pay access charges and or contribute to the federal usf  remain pending 
the fcc requires certain voip providers to offer enhanced  or e  emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers 
high speed internet access services following a june us supreme court decision affirming the fcc s classification of cable modem internet access service as an information service and declining to impose mandatory common carrier regulation on cable providers  the fcc issued an order in september declaring the high speed internet access services  which are provided by ilecs  including our local segment  are information services rather than telecommunications services 
as a result  over time ilecs will be relieved of the obligations to provide the underlying broadband transmission to other internet service providers 
a decision on whether all high speed internet access services  regardless of the technology used  are subject to various fcc consumer protection regulations is pending  and the imposition of any such obligations could result in significant costs to us 
wireless operations the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our business and wireless spectrum holdings 
fcc requirements impose operating and other restrictions on our business that increase our costs 
the fcc does not currently regulate rates for services offered by cmrs providers  and states are legally preempted from regulating such rates and entry into any market 
the communications act and fcc rules also require the fcc s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an fcc license  although the fcc s rules permit spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses  including our licenses  with fcc oversight 
approval from the federal trade commission and the department of justice  as well as state or local regulatory authorities  also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum interests 
the fcc sets rules  regulations and policies to  among other things grant licenses in the megahertz  or mhz  band  mhz band  gigahertz  or ghz  pcs band  and ghz broadband radio service  or brs  and educational broadband service  or ebs  bands  and license renewals  rule on assignments and transfers of control of fcc licenses  and leases covering our use of fcc licensees held by other persons and organizations  govern the interconnection of our iden and cdma networks with other wireless and wireline carriers  establish access and universal service funding provisions  impose fines and forfeitures for violations of fcc rules  regulate the technical standards governing wireless services  and impose other obligations that it determines to be in the public interest 
we hold several kinds of licenses to deploy our services ghz pcs licenses utilized in our cdma network  and mhz and mhz licenses utilized in our iden network 
we also hold ghz brs licenses  ghz brs licenses  and we lease use of others ghz brs and ebs licenses  for our first generation fixed wireless internet access service 
we also hold and lease ghz  ghz and other fcc licenses that we currently do not utilize in our networks or operations 
ghz pcs license conditions all pcs licenses are granted for ten year terms 
for purposes of issuing pcs licenses  the fcc utilizes major trading areas  or mta  and basic trading areas  or bta  with several btas making up each mta 
licenses may be revoked if the fcc s construction requirements are not met 
we have met these requirements in all of our mta and bta markets 
if applicable buildout conditions are met  these licenses may be renewed for additional ten year terms 
renewal applications are not subject to auctions 
if a renewal application is challenged  the fcc grants a preference commonly referred to as a license renewal expectancy to the applicant if it can demonstrate it has provided substantial service during the past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
the licenses for the mhz of spectrum in the ghz band that we received as part of the fcc s report and order  described below  have year terms and are not subject to specific buildout conditions  but are subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our pcs licenses 
mhz and mhz license conditions we hold licenses to deploy our iden services in the mhz and mhz bands 
because spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands was originally licensed in small groups of channels  we hold thousands of these licenses  which together allow us to provide coverage across much of the continental united states 
our mhz and mhz licenses are subject to requirements that we meet population coverage benchmarks tied to the initial license grant dates 
to date  we have met all of the construction milestones applicable to these licenses  except in the case of licenses that are not material to our business 
our mhz and mhz licenses have year terms  at the end of which each license is subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our ghz licenses 
brs ebs license conditions we hold and lease fcc brs and ebs licenses 
we currently use this spectrum to provide fixed wireless internet access services to homes and small businesses using first generation line of sight technology 
this service operates across the country in markets with approximately  subscribers 
we operate our network and a third party provides customer care 
we intend to provide wireless interactive multimedia services  or wims  using this spectrum along with other services  such as fixed point to point communications 
in  the fcc ordered the mhz band  or the ghz band  reconfigured into upper and lower band segments for low power operations  and a mid band segment for high power operations 
pending final fcc rules  no actual reconfiguration transition to the new band plan has begun  but planning for this work has commenced  and we expect field transition work will begin in and continue for several years 
the fcc also affirmed its prohibition of commercial ownership on approximately of the total ghz spectrum band  which is held primarily by educational and non profit institutions  however  these institutions are authorized to lease up to of their licensed spectrum to commercial operators  such as us  subject to certain restrictions 
in addition  the fcc adopted a band plan that requires the relocation of licensed brs operations from the mhz band  or the ghz band  into the ghz band 
the fcc has sought comment on how to ensure that ghz incumbents  such as us  receive reimbursement for their relocation costs 
we and other parties intend to transition the ghz band to its new configuration market by market in a process that may require several years to complete nationally 
when the transition is completed  we believe that the ghz band will be more suitable for fourth generation g technology that will enable fixed  portable and mobile wims services 
the fcc conditioned its approval of the sprint nextel merger on two deployment milestones in the ghz spectrum 
within four years following the august  effective date of the merger order  we must offer service in the ghz band to a population of no less than million people 
this deployment must include areas within a minimum of nine of the nation s most populous btas and at least one bta less populous than the nation s th most populous bta 
in these ten btas  the deployment must cover at least one third of each bta s population 
in addition  within six years from the effective date of the merger order  we must offer service in the ghz band to at least million more people in areas within a minimum of nine additional btas in the most populous btas  and at least one additional bta less populous than the nation s th most populous bta 
in these additional ten btas  the deployment must also cover at least one third of each bta s population 
mhz band spectrum reconfiguration in recent years  a number of public safety communications systems operating on high site systems in the mhz block of spectrum have experienced interference that is believed to be a result of the low site operations of cmrs providers operating on adjacent frequencies in the same geographic area 
in  we filed a proposal with the fcc that would result in a more efficient use of spectrum through the reconfiguration of spectrum licenses and spectrum allocations in the  and mhz bands and  thereby  resolve many of these interference problems 
in  following a rulemaking to consider proposals to solve the public safety interference issue  the fcc adopted a report and order that included new rules regarding interference in the mhz band and a comprehensive plan to reconfigure the mhz band 
in february  we accepted the report and order  which was necessary before the order became effective  because the report and order required us to undertake a number of obligations and accept modifications to our fcc licenses 
the report and order provides for the exchange of a portion of our fcc spectrum licenses  which the fcc is implementing through modifications to these licenses 
specifically  the report and order modified a number of fcc licenses in the mhz band  including many of our licenses  and implemented rules to reconfigure spectrum in the mhz band in a month phased transition process 
it also obligated us to surrender all of our holdings in the mhz spectrum band and certain portions of our holdings in the mhz spectrum band  and to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the mhz spectrum band 
under the report and order  we received licenses for mhz of nationwide spectrum in the ghz band  but we are required to relocate and reimburse the incumbent licensees in this band for their costs of relocation to another band designated by the fcc 
the report and order requires us to complete the first phase of reconfiguration of the mhz band in certain of our markets  including many of our larger markets  within an month period 
completion of the reconfiguration process in any particular market involves reaching agreement and coordinating numerous processes with the incumbent licensees in that market  as well as vendors and contractors that will be performing much of the reconfiguration 
we are permitted to continue to use the spectrum in the mhz band that was surrendered under the report and order during the reconfiguration process 
however  as part of the reconfiguration process in most markets  we will cease use of a portion of the mhz spectrum that we currently use before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum in that market 
to mitigate the temporary loss of the use of this spectrum  in many markets we will need to construct additional transmitter and receiver sites for use by our iden network or acquire additional spectrum in the mhz or mhz bands 
in markets where we are unable to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum  the decrease in capacity may adversely affect the performance of our iden network  require us to curtail subscriber additions on the iden network in that market until the capacity limitation can be corrected  or both 
degradation in iden network performance in any market could result in increased subscriber churn in that market  the effect of which could be exacerbated if we are forced to curtail iden subscriber additions in that market 
the reconfiguration process contemplated by the report and order may adversely affect our business and operations  which could adversely affect our future growth and operating results 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the united states department of the treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum positions in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision  plus the actual costs that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities under the report and order 
the fcc determined under the report and order that  for purposes of calculating that payment amount  the value of this ghz spectrum is about  million and the aggregate value of the mhz spectrum and the mhz spectrum surrendered  net of mhz spectrum received as part of the exchange  is about  million  which  because of the potential payment to the us treasury  results in minimum cash expenditures of about billion by us under the report and order 
the fcc has designated an independent transition administrator to monitor  facilitate and review the expenditures of the mhz and ghz band reconfigurations 
a precise methodology for evaluating and confirming our internal costs has not yet been established by the transition administrator 
because the transition administrator may not agree that all of the costs we submit as external and internal costs are appropriate or are subject to credit  we may incur certain costs as part of the reconfiguration process for which we will not receive credit against the potential payment to the us treasury 
in addition  we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed billion 
as of december  we had incurred  on a cash basis  approximately million of costs under the report and order 
pursuant to the terms of the report and order  we have established an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of billion to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
new spectrum opportunities and spectrum auctions several fcc proceedings and initiatives are underway that may affect the availability of spectrum used or useful in the provision of commercial wireless services  which may allow new competitors to enter the wireless market 
we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to the wireless industry or us in the future 
other fcc requirements services pursuant to fcc rules  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide e services in a two tiered manner 
phase i requires wireless carriers to transmit to a requesting public safety answering point  or psap  both a the caller s telephone number and b the location of the cell site from which the call is being made 
phase ii requires the transmission of more accurate location information using latitude and longitude 
implementation of phase i or phase ii e service must be completed within six months of a psap request for service in its area  or longer  based on the agreement between the individual psap and carrier 
we have deployed the necessary platforms and infrastructure to support phase i and phase ii e service throughout our network 
actual availability of phase i or phase ii e services in any particular market is dependent upon receipt of a request for service and completion of necessary upgrades by local governments  local exchange carriers and third party database providers 
these upgrades are not within our control and we cannot unilaterally deploy e services 
with respect to our iden and cdma network services  the more accurate information delivered in phase ii can only be determined if the customer is using a handset with global positioning satellite  or gps  capability 
because our phase ii e services can be accessed only with gps capable handsets  the fcc has required that a certain percentage of new handset activations be gps capable  and that of our total subscriber base use gps capable handsets by december  all new handset activations are currently gps capable 
however  we were unable to meet the december  deadline to convert our existing subscriber base to gps enabled devices 
we have filed a request for a waiver that seeks additional time to comply  on which the fcc has not yet ruled 
failure to comply with the fcc s rules may result in fcc sanctions 
the costs we may incur in an effort to accelerate our customers transition to gps capable handsets to meet these requirements could be significant  and will be dependent on a number of factors  including the number of new subscribers added to our network who purchase gps capable handsets  the number of existing subscribers who upgrade from non gps capable handsets to gps capable handsets  the rate of our customer churn and the cost of gps capable handsets 
truth in billing and consumer protection the fcc s truth in billing rules generally require cmrs licensees  such as us  to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their wireless bills  including brief  clear  and non misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided 
in response to a petition from the national association of state utility consumer advocates  the fcc found that state regulation of cmrs rates  including line items on consumer bills  is preempted by federal statute 
however  many states continue to attempt to impose various regulations on the billing practices of wireless carriers  and the fcc is continuing to look at issues of consumer protection and the appropriate state and federal roles 
if states gain such authority  or there are other changes in the truth in billing rules  our billing and customer service costs could increase 
calea requirements the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea  requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to modify equipment  facilities and services to allow for authorized electronic surveillance based on either industry or fcc standards 
in september  the fcc extended calea obligations to facilities based broadband internet access providers and to interconnected voip providers  whether wireline or wireless 
the fcc has pending a range of issues involving calea  including calea compliance extensions and exemptions  cost recovery issues  identification of future services and entities subject to calea  and enforcement matters 
we build our networks to industry standards  and those standards include the ability for law enforcement to conduct authorized surveillance 
like other cmrs carriers  we have sought an extension of calea deadlines for packet mode data services and this request remains pending 
if the extension requests are not granted  we could be subject to fines if we are unable to comply with a surveillance request from a law enforcement agency 
homeland security homeland security issues are receiving attention at the fcc  from the states and in congress 
the fcc chairman has announced plans for a new fcc bureau devoted to this area 
we expect that several initiatives  including the delivery of emergency alerts over wireless devices  and increased scrutiny of wireless carriers networks in the aftermath of last year s natural disasters  could lead to new regulatory requirements regarding disaster preparedness  network reliability  and communications among first responders 
we are unable to predict the impact of these initiatives on our business 
privacy related regulations we comply with fcc mandated rules that limit how carriers may use customer proprietary network information  or cpni  for marketing purposes  and specify what carriers must do to safeguard cpni held by third parties 
it has recently been reported that the call detail records of both wireline and wireless telephone customers are available from certain internet based vendors 
both congress and state legislatures are considering legislation to criminalize the sale of call detail records and to further restrict the manner in which carriers make such information available 
the fcc is investigating these practices and is examining whether existing regulations with respect to cpni require revision or expansion  which could result in additional costs to us  including administrative or operational burdens on our customer care  sales  marketing and it systems 
tower siting wireless systems must comply with various federal  state and local regulations that govern the siting  lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas  including regulation promulgated by the fcc and federal aviation administration  or faa 
fcc rules subject certain cell site locations to environmental and historic preservation statutory requirements 
to the extent governmental agencies impose additional requirements on the tower siting process  the time and cost to construct cell towers could be negatively impacted 
environmental compliance we have identified seven sites  not currently owned or operated by us  that formerly contained manufactured gas plants that may have been owned or operated by entities acquired by our subsidiary  centel corporation  before we acquired it 
we and the current land owner of the site in columbus  nebraska are working with the environmental protection agency  or epa  pursuant to an administrative consent order 
amounts expended pursuant to the order are not expected to be material 
we are negotiating with the epa as to whether clean up is required at two additional sites 
in addition  centel has entered into agreements with another potentially responsible party to share costs in connection with four of the sites  including two of those where the epa is involved 
we are working to assess the scope and nature of these sites and our potential responsibility 
other environmental compliance and remediation expenditures result mainly from the operation of standby power generators for our telecommunications equipment 
these expenditures arise in connection with standards compliance  permits or occasional remediation  which are usually related to generators  batteries or fuel storage 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that future environmental compliance and remediation expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
patents  trademarks and licenses we own numerous patents  patent applications  service marks and trademarks in the united states and other countries 
we have a program to file applications for trademarks  service marks and patents where we believe this protection is appropriate 
sprint  powervision  sprint pcs  nextel and boost mobile are our registered trademarks 
our services often use the intellectual property of others  such as licensed software  and we often license copyrights  patents and trademarks of others 
in total  these licenses and our copyrights  patents  trademarks and service marks are of material importance to the business 
generally  our trademarks  trademark licenses and service marks have no limitation on duration 
our patents and licensed patents have remaining terms generally ranging from one to years 
we occasionally license our intellectual property to others  including licenses to others to use the trademarks sprint and nextel 
we have received claims in the past  and may in the future receive claims  that we  or that third parties from whom we license intellectual property  have infringed on the intellectual property of others 
these claims can be time consuming and costly to defend  and divert management resources 
if these claims are successful  we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services  or the third parties from whom we license intellectual property could be forced to pay significant damages  which could increase the cost of these products and services or force them to stop providing certain products or services to us 
we also could enter into licenses with unfavorable terms  including royalty payments  which could adversely affect our business 
employee relations as of december   we had approximately  active employees  an increase of about  since december  due primarily to the sprint nextel merger 
approximately  of these employees were represented by unions 
it is anticipated that embarq will have approximately  employees at the time of the spin off 
in and continuing throughout  we recognized charges from organizational realignment initiatives 
the restructuring was a company wide effort to create a more customer focused organization 
these decisions included work force reductions in each segment and corporate functions 
in  we announced the wind down of our web hosting services 
restructurings of other long distance operations also occurred in the continuing effort to create a more efficient cost structure 
these decisions included work force reductions 
additional information regarding the impacts of these decisions can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k

item a 
risk factors risks related to the sprint nextel merger and the spin off of embarq we may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses of nextel with ours and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
significant management attention and resources are being devoted to integrating the nextel wireless network and other wireless technologies with ours  as well as the business practices  operations and support functions of the two companies 
the challenges we are facing and or may face in the future in connection with these integration efforts include the following integrating our cdma and iden wireless networks  which operate on different technology platforms and use different spectrum bands  and developing wireless devices and other products and services that operate seamlessly on both technology platforms  developing and deploying next generation wireless technologies  combining and simplifying diverse product and service offerings  subscriber plans and sales and marketing approaches  preserving subscriber  supplier and other important relationships  consolidating and integrating duplicative facilities and operations  including back office systems  addressing differences in business cultures  preserving employee morale and retaining key employees  while maintaining focus on providing consistent  high quality customer service and meeting our operational and financial goals  and adequately addressing business integration issues while also planning and preparing for the contemplated spin off of embarq 
the process of integrating nextel s operations with ours could cause interruptions of  or loss of momentum in  our business and financial performance 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may also incur additional and unforeseen expenses in connection with the integration efforts 
there can be no assurance that the expense savings and synergies that we anticipate from the merger will be realized fully or within our expected timeframe 
we also recently acquired five pcs affiliates us unwired  iwo holdings  gulf coast wireless  alamosa holdings and enterprise communications  and will acquire nextel partners when the required regulatory approvals are obtained 
the process of integrating the business practices  operations and support functions of these companies could involve challenges similar to those identified above or add to those challenges by placing a greater strain on our management and employees 
operational challenges  proposed tax law changes and other uncertainties may make it difficult or less economical to complete the contemplated spin off of embarq on terms that are acceptable to us 
failure to complete the spin off could adversely affect our growth 
there are significant operational and technical challenges that need to be addressed in order to separate the assets and operations of embarq from the rest of our business in connection with the planned spin off of embarq to our shareholders 
the spin off will require the creation of a new publicly traded company with a capital structure appropriate for that company  the creation and staffing of operational and corporate functional groups and the establishment of ongoing commercial arrangements and transition services arrangements between us and embarq 
the spin off may result in additional and unforeseen expenses  and completion of the spin off cannot be assured because it is conditioned upon  among other things  receipt of required consents and approvals from various federal and state regulatory agencies  including state pucs 
these consents and approvals  if received  may impose conditions and limitations that could jeopardize or delay completion of the spin off and could reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger and the spin off 
the us house of representatives and the us senate have separately approved legislation either of which would  if enacted  make certain changes to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  which governs the tax treatment of the spin off 
these bills  which are currently subject to conference negotiation between members of the house and senate  contain similar  but not identical provisions 
in addition  the us department of the treasury has recommended a similar provision regarding spin offs in its revenue proposals for the fiscal year budget 
after consultation with our tax advisors  we believe that it is unlikely that any of the proposed legislation  as currently drafted  would prevent the contemplated spin off of embarq 
however  if we are unable to obtain satisfactory opinions from counsel regarding the tax free qualification of the spin off  our board of directors would consider several options  including electing not to complete the spin off 
we expect to receive approximately billion in the form of cash and senior notes of embarq in exchange for the assets contributed to embarq 
we expect to sell the senior notes issued to us and intend to use the proceeds from any such sale and the proceeds paid to us by embarq to repay various obligations 
there can be no assurance of the final amount of indebtedness to be incurred by embarq or the proceeds to be received by us 
if the contemplated spin off of embarq is not completed  we may have slower rates of growth than currently expected because of the industry wide trends of increased competition and product substitution that are adversely affecting local communications businesses 
moreover  our strategy of developing our higher growth wireless business may conflict with the strategy and interests of embarq  particularly as customers are increasingly choosing between wireline and wireless services 
if the spin off of embarq does not qualify as a tax free transaction  tax could be imposed on both our shareholders and us 
we have received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  or irs  that the spin off of embarq will qualify for tax free treatment under code sections and in addition  we intend to obtain opinions of counsel from each of cravath  swaine moore llp and paul  weiss  rifkind  wharton garrison llp that the spin off will so qualify 
the irs ruling relies  and the opinions will rely  on certain representations  assumptions and undertakings  including those relating to the past and future conduct of embarq s and our business  and neither the irs ruling nor the opinions would be valid if such representations  assumptions and undertakings were incorrect 
moreover  the irs private letter ruling does not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution will qualify for tax free treatment 
notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinions  the irs could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the representations  assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter ruling are false or have been violated  or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the irs private letter ruling 
if the distribution fails to qualify for tax free treatment  it will be treated as a taxable distribution to our shareholders in an amount equal to the fair market value of embarq s equity securities ie  embarq s common stock issued to our common shareholders received by them 
in addition  we would be required to recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of the embarq equity securities that we distribute on the distribution date plus the fair market value of the senior notes received by us 
furthermore  subsequent events could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
for example  even minimal acquisitions of our equity securities or embarq s equity securities that are deemed to be part of a plan or a series of related transactions that include the distribution and the sprint nextel merger could cause us to recognize gain on the distribution 
we will be subject to restrictions on acquisitions involving our stock and other stock issuances and possibly other corporate opportunities in order to enable the contemplated spin off of embarq to qualify for tax free treatment 
the contemplated spin off of embarq cannot qualify for tax free treatment if or more by vote or value of our stock  or the stock of embarq  is acquired or issued as part of a plan  or series of related transactions  that includes the contemplated spin off 
because the nextel merger generally is treated as involving the acquisition of of our stock and the stock of embarq for purposes of this analysis  until the completion of the spin off and for some period thereafter  we will be subject to restrictions on certain acquisitions using our stock and other issuances of our stock in order to enable the spin off to qualify for tax free treatment 
at this time  it is not possible to determine how long these restrictions will apply 
in addition  it is not possible to determine whether these limitations will have a material impact on us 
we are subject to exclusivity provisions and other restrictions under our arrangements with the remaining independent pcs affiliates 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to achieve synergies and fully integrate the operations of nextel in the geographic areas served by those pcs affiliates  and we could incur significant costs to resolve issues related to the merger under these arrangements 
the manner in which these restrictions will be addressed is not currently known 
the arrangements with the remaining five independent pcs affiliates restrict our and their ability to own  operate  build or manage specified wireless communication networks or to sell certain wireless services within specified geographic areas 
several of these pcs affiliates have commenced litigation against us asserting that actions that we have taken or may take in the future in connection with our integration efforts are inconsistent with our obligations under our agreements with them  particularly with respect to the restrictions noted above 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to achieve synergies and fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners  following its expected acquisition  in the areas served by those pcs affiliates 
we could incur significant costs to resolve these issues 
risks related to our business and operations we face intense competition that may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
each of our three operating segments faces intense competition 
our ability to compete effectively depends on  among other things  the factors discussed below 
the blurring of the traditional dividing lines between local  long distance  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines between long distance  local  wireless  cable and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify across all of our business segments as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products  and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 
if we are not able to attract and retain customers  our financial performance could be impaired 
our ability to compete successfully for new customers and to retain our existing customers will depend on our marketing and sales and service delivery activities  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced services that are attractive to existing or potential customers  and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors 
a key element in the economic success of communications carriers is the ability to retain customers as measured by the rate of subscriber churn 
our ability to retain customers and reduce our rate of churn is affected by a number of factors including  with respect to our wireless business  the actual or perceived quality and coverage of our network and the attractiveness of our service offerings 
our ability to retain customers in our businesses also is affected by competitive pricing pressures and the quality of our customer service 
our efforts to reduce churn may not be successful 
a high rate of churn could impair our ability to increase the revenues of  or cause a deterioration in the operating margins of  our wireless operations or our operations as a whole 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract customers from competitiors and face increased credit risk from first time wireless subscribers 
we increasingly must attract a greater proportion of our new customers from our competitors existing customer bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
the higher market penetration also means that customers purchasing wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  which generally results in both a higher churn rate due to involuntary churn and in a higher bad debt expense 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs  which would adversely affect our revenues  growth and profitability 
we compete with several other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created pricing plans that have resulted in declining average revenue per minute of use for voice services  a trend which we expect will continue 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact customer retention  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology such as the move to third generation  or g  wireless technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
the rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies or alternative services that exceed our levels of service or that consumers prefer over our services 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose customers to our competitors 
mergers or other combinations involving our competitors and new entrants  including mvnos  beginning to offer wireless services may also continue to increase competition 
these wireless operators may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by either of our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per user  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
one of the primary differentiating features of our nextel branded service is the two way walkie talkie service available on our iden network 
a number of wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  which supplies equipment for our nextel branded service  have begun to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing walkie talkie services that are designed to compete with our walkie talkie services 
several of our competitors have introduced handsets that are capable of providing walkie talkie services 
if these competitors services are perceived to be or become  or if any such services introduced in the future are  comparable to our nextel branded walkie talkie services  a key competitive advantage of our nextel service would be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
failure to improve wireless subscriber service and to continue to enhance the quality and features of our wireless networks and meet capacity requirements of our subscriber growth could impair our financial performance and adversely affect our results of operations 
we must continually make investments and incur costs in order to improve our wireless subscriber service and remain competitive 
in connection with our continuing enhancement of the quality of our wireless networks and related services  we must maintain and expand the capacity and coverage of our networks  obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets  if and when necessary  secure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites and obtain zoning and construction approvals or permits at appropriate locations  and obtain adequate quantities of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  and related accessories to meet subscriber demand 
network enhancements may not occur as scheduled or at the cost that we have estimated 
delays or failure to add network capacity  or increased costs of adding capacity  could limit our ability to satisfy our wireless subscribers  resulting in decreased revenues 
even if we continuously upgrade our wireless networks  there can be no assurance that existing subscribers will not prefer features of our competitors and switch wireless providers 
consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our long distance segment competes with at t formerly known as sbc communications  which recently acquired at t  verizon communications which recently acquired mci  bellsouth corporation  qwest communications  level communications  inc  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors  in the provision of wireline services 
some of these companies have built high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
these companies claim certain cost structure advantages which  among other factors  may allow them to maintain profitability while offering services at a price below that which we can offer profitably 
increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
both at t and verizon  as a result of their recent acquisitions  continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance customers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities is a significant cost of service for our long distance segment 
the acquisition of at t by sbc and mci by verizon could give those carriers long distance operations cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the incumbent local carrier 
in urban areas where embarq operates  there is substantial competition from clecs and cable operators  and competition is increasing in the suburban and rural areas that it serves 
cable companies selling cable modems continue to provide competition for high speed data services to residential customers in embarq s service areas and are beginning to offer voice telephone service using their cable facilities in those areas 
competition from wireless services also affects embarq  as e mail and wireless services continue to grow as an alternative to the wireline services we offer 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry and the technology we use places us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended both to enhance our competitiveness by supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our customers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services 
any resulting customer dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain customers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects 
our wireless networks provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and handsets are generally higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology 
if we are unable to meet our future capital needs relating to investment in our networks and other obligations  it may be necessary for us to curtail  delay or abandon our business growth plans 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness to fund our plans  it could cause a decline in our credit rating and could increase our borrowing costs or limit our ability to raise additional capital 
we have substantial indebtedness  and we will require capital to satisfy our debt service requirements and other obligations  such as the obligation to i purchase the shares of nextel partners common stock that we do not already own  ii pay debt that we will assume in connection with the acquisition of nextel partners  and iii pay debt that we have assumed in connection with the acquisitions of pcs affiliates 
we also will require additional capital to make the capital expenditures necessary to implement our business plans or support future growth of our wireless business 
continued declines in the ability of our long distance segment to generate cash from its operations requires us to increase cash generated from our other segments 
a decrease in our ability to generate cash from operations  or to obtain funds from other sources  may require us to seek additional financing to expand our businesses and meet our other obligations or divert cash used for capital expenditures  which could detract from operations and limit our ability to increase  or cause a decline in  revenues and net income 
in addition  any future acquisitions may be made with additional borrowings 
we may not be able to arrange additional financing to fund our requirements on terms acceptable to us 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  our financial performance  general economic conditions and prevailing market conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed could  among other things  result in the inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not continue to generate sufficient cash from our operations  our credit rating could be adversely affected 
as a result  our future borrowing costs would likely increase and our access to capital could be adversely affected 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements related to certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of customers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into outsourcing agreements for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we have also entered into agreements with third parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced many aspects of our customer care and billing functions to third parties 
we also have entered into an agreement whereby a third party has leased or operates a significant number of our communications towers  and we sublease space on these towers 
as a result  we must rely on third parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our customers 
if these third parties are unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of customers 
the intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including handset device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  or may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
such claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our nextel branded services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our iden operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is our sole source for most of the equipment that supports the iden network and for all of the handsets we offer under the nextel brand except blackberry devices 
although our handset supply agreement with motorola is structured to provide competitively priced handsets  the cost of iden handsets is generally higher than handsets that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability 
this difference may make it more difficult or costly for us to offer handsets at prices that are attractive to potential customers 
in addition  the higher cost of iden handsets requires us to absorb a larger part of the cost of offering handsets to new and existing customers 
these increased costs and handset subsidy expenses may reduce our growth and profitability 
also  we must rely on motorola to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services we plan to offer to subscribers of services on our iden network  including a dual mode handset 
a decision by motorola to discontinue manufacturing  supporting or enhancing our iden based infrastructure and handsets would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  because iden technology is not as widely adopted and has fewer subscribers than other wireless technologies and because we expect that over time more of our customers will utilize service offered on our cdma network  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
further  our ability to timely and efficiently implement the spectrum reconfiguration plan in connection with the fcc s report and order is dependent  in part  on motorola 
the reconfiguration process contemplated by the fcc s report and order may adversely affect our business and operations  which could adversely affect our future growth and operating results 
as part of an ongoing fcc proceeding to eliminate interference with public safety operations in the mhz band  the fcc released the report and order  which provides for the exchange of a portion of the fcc licenses used in our iden network for other licenses  including mhz of spectrum in the ghz band 
in order to accomplish the reconfiguration of the mhz spectrum band that is contemplated by the report and order  in most cases we will need to cease our use of a portion of the mhz spectrum on our iden network in a particular market before we are able to commence use of replacement mhz spectrum in that market 
to mitigate the temporary loss of the use of this spectrum  in many markets we will need to construct additional transmitter and receiver sites or acquire additional spectrum in the mhz or mhz bands 
this spectrum may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
in markets where we are unable to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum as needed  the decrease in capacity may adversely affect the performance of our iden network  require us to curtail subscriber additions in those markets until the capacity limitation can be corrected  or a combination of the two 
degradation in network performance in any market could result in higher subscriber churn in that market  the effect of which could be exacerbated if we are forced to curtail subscriber additions in that market 
a resulting loss of a significant number of subscribers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we expect that the reconfiguration process will have at least some adverse impact on the capacity and performance of our iden network  particularly in some of our more capacity constrained markets 
in addition  the report and order gives the fcc the authority to suspend our use of the ghz spectrum that we received under the report and order if we do not comply with our obligations under the report and order 
government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
wireless operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how such services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
the communications act preempts state and local regulation of market entry by  and the rates charged by  cmrs providers  except that states may exercise authority over such things as certain billing practices and consumer related issues 
the california puc has imposed rules designed to impose consumer protections 
several other states are considering similar initiatives 
these regulations could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
fcc rules require all wireless licensees to meet certain buildout requirements and substantially comply with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act of in order to retain their licenses 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the pcs license for that license area 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
the fcc has initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage 
for example  it is considering new concepts that might permit unlicensed users to share our licensed spectrum to the extent the fcc believes harmful interference will not occur 
these new uses could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operational costs 
cmrs providers must implement e capabilities in accordance with fcc rules 
failure to deploy e service consistent with fcc requirements could subject us to significant fines 
we were unable to satisfy the requirement that of our subscriber base have assisted gps capable handsets by december  we have filed a request for a waiver with the fcc seeking an extension of the december  handset penetration deadline to december   on which the fcc has not yet ruled 
the fcc  together with the faa  also regulates tower marking and lighting 
in addition  tower construction is affected by federal  state and local statutes addressing zoning  environmental protection and historic preservation 
the fcc adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects  which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities 
the fcc is also considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower construction  which  if adopted  could make it more difficult to deploy facilities 
wireline operations 
the fcc order released in february on unes has largely eliminated the ability of our long distance segment to use the unbundled network element platform to offer competing local services to small business and residential customers in areas outside the embarq local service areas  and the fcc s pending re examination of pricing guidelines for unes could limit our future ability to use high capacity loop and transport unes to offer competing local services to medium and large business customers 
the continued regulatory uncertainty regarding voip may result in a reduction in access revenues for our local segment and may adversely affect the competitive position of our long distance segment to the extent it makes less use of voip than our competitors 
while clarification of voip s status as either an information service or a telecommunications service will provide greater certainty regarding the payment structure for voip traffic  the resulting decision could adversely impact access revenues for our local segment 
adoption by the fcc of intercarrier compensation reform also may provide more regulatory certainty regarding charges applicable to voip traffic  but it could also reduce the revenues of our local segment unless the plan provides a mechanism to replace those revenues with revenues from other sources 
depending upon its outcome  the fcc s proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our long distance segment and revenues received by our local segment for special access services in the future 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns

nextel merger and contemplated local spin off on august   a subsidiary of our company merged with nextel 
in connection with the nextel merger  we changed our name to sprint nextel corporation 
the aggregate consideration paid for the merger was approximately billion 
at the time that we announced the merger with nextel  we also announced that we intend to spin off our local communications business to our shareholders on a tax free basis 
the business being spun off  which is the business reported as the local segment in our financial statements  will be known as embarq corporation  and we refer to this business as embarq 
to mitigate the risk that the stock we issued in the sprint nextel merger would preclude the tax free treatment of the spin off of embarq  and to ensure that sprint was treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes  the merger agreement provided for an allocation of cash and shares of our common stock  determined as of the date of the merger  that would result in the original sprint shareholders maintaining at least of the outstanding voting power upon closing of the merger 
pursuant to this allocation  nextel common shareholders received million in cash and billion shares of our voting and non voting common stock in the aggregate  or and shares of our stock in exchange for each then outstanding share of nextel stock 
it is anticipated that the common stock of embarq will trade on the nyse and that the spin off will be completed in the second quarter we merged with nextel to secure a number of potential strategic and financial benefits including  but not limited to  the following the combination of extensive network and spectrum assets  which enables us to offer consumers  businesses and government agencies a wide array of broadband wireless and integrated communications services  the combination of nextel s strength in business and government wireless services with our position in consumer wireless and data services  including services supported by our global ip network  which enables us to serve a broader customer base  the size and scale of the combined company  which is comparable to that of our two largest competitors  is expected to enable more operating efficiencies than either company could achieve on its own  and the ability to position us strategically in the fastest growing areas of the communications industry 
we expect to recognize significant synergies associated with this merger  which include revenue and subscriber synergies primarily arising out of cross selling opportunities and the accelerated deployment of new features and services  reduced capital spending due to the elimination of the need to build a data overlay network as had been planned by nextel  reduced construction costs  expected volume discounts and benefits of increased purchasing capacity and reduced and consolidated facilities and back office functions  reduced network operating costs primarily arising out of co location of cell sites  process efficiencies and migration of nextel backhaul and other telecommunications traffic to our long distance network  reduced selling  general and administrative expenses primarily arising out of consolidation of customer care  billing and other it functions  increased scale and volume discounts and reduced combined sales and marketing costs and general administrative expenses  and marketing  sales and fulfillment savings as a result of headcount savings  the rationalization of distribution channels  greater volume discounts on devices and other scale benefits 
we began to realize some synergies in  and expect to realize additional synergies over a number of years 
however  we believe that our operating results for at least the next several quarters will be negatively impacted by costs that will be incurred to achieve these synergies 
such costs are generally not expected to be recurring in nature  and will include costs associated with the spin off of embarq  costs associated with integrating back office systems  severance costs associated with the termination of the employment of certain employees  and lease and other contract termination costs 
in addition  our results will be negatively impacted by significant additional non cash amortization charges associated primarily with the value of the customer relationships that were acquired in the merger  as well as additional non cash charges for stock based compensation associated with the nextel employees 
the ability to achieve these synergies and the timing in which the benefits can be realized will depend in large part on the ability to integrate our networks  business operations  back office functions and other support systems and infrastructure 
business we offer a comprehensive suite of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of our two targeted customer groups individuals  and businesses and government agencies 
we conduct our operations through three segments referred to as wireless  long distance and local 
we  together with the pcs affiliates and nextel partners  offer digital and wireless services in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands and provide wireless coverage to a total domestic population of about million 
the pcs affiliates  through commercial arrangements with us  provide wireless services under the sprint brand name in certain mid sized and tertiary us markets on wireless networks built and operated at their expense  in most instances using spectrum licensed to  and controlled by  us 
nextel partners provides digital wireless communications services under the nextel brand name in certain mid sized and tertiary us markets on wireless networks built and operated at its expense 
during and the first quarter  we acquired five pcs affiliates and we expect to acquire nextel partners in the second quarter we also are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and are one of the largest carriers of internet traffic 
in addition  we provide regulated local exchange telephone services to approximately million access lines in our local service territories in states 
we believe the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services offered and quality of service 
although competitive pricing is often an important factor in potential customers purchase decisions  we believe that our targeted customer base of individuals and businesses and government agencies will also base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services 
we operate in an industry that has been and continues to be subject to consolidation and dynamic change 
to maintain our operating margins in an environment of intense competition that could put pressure on customer pricing  we continually seek ways to create or improve capital and operating efficiencies in our business 
consequently  we routinely reassess our business strategies and their implications on our operations and these assessments may continue to impact the future valuation of our long lived assets 
as part of our overall business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand and complement our business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that  if consummated  could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and or results of operations 
the fcc regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed spectrum that is essential to our business 
the fcc and state pucs also regulate the provision of telecommunications services 
future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations 
statements contained in this annual report relating to business strategies  operating plans  planned expenditures  expected capital requirements and other forward looking statements regarding our business generally do not take into account the contemplated spin off of embarq 
management overview wireless through our wireless segment  we  together with the remaining pcs affiliates and nextel partners  offer digital wireless service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  and provide wireless coverage in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas  to more than million people 
including subscribers who purchase services from the pcs affiliates  nextel partners and our mvnos  we served more than million subscribers at the end of we offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services on networks that utilize cdma and iden technology 
our strategy is to utilize state of the art technology to provide differentiated wireless services and applications in order to acquire and retain high quality wireless subscribers 
to enable us to offer innovative applications and services  we are deploying high speed ev do technology across our cdma network 
the services supported by this technology  marketed as powervision  give consumer and business subscribers with ev do enabled devices access to numerous sophisticated data messaging  imaging  entertainment and location based applications 
on our iden network  we continue to develop features and services that are designed to meet the needs of business and government customers with a particular focus on services that build upon our unique walkie talkie features 
we also seek to realize operating efficiencies in our business  largely from merger related synergies  and optimize the performance of our network while minimizing costs 
we offer wireless mobile telephone and data transmission services and features in a variety of pricing plans  including prepaid service plans 
excluding prepaid service plans  we offer these services on a contract basis  typically for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile brand  as a means to directly target the youth and prepaid wireless service markets 
we also offer wholesale services to mvnos  which purchase wireless services from us at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers under their own brand names 
these companies bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
we also recently entered into a joint venture with several cable companies to develop converged next generation products for consumers designed to combine many of cable s core products and interactive features with wireless technology to deliver a broad range of services  including video  wireless voice and data services  high speed internet and cable phone service 
our wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services  the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers  and the revenue generated by each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate equipment revenues is primarily a function of the number of new and existing subscribers who purchase handsets and other accessories 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate wholesale revenues is primarily a function of the number and type of mvnos that resell our wireless service and the number of subscribers to whom they provide service 
we increasingly must attract a greater proportion of our new customers from our competitors existing customer bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
the higher market penetration also means that customers purchasing wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  which generally results in both a higher churn rate due to involuntary churn and in a higher bad debt expense 
although many of the costs relating to the operation of our wireless networks are fixed in the short term  other costs  such as interconnection fees  fluctuate based on the utilization of the networks 
sales and marketing expenses are largely dependent on the number of subscriber additions and the nature and extent of our marketing and promotional activities 
general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead costs and other costs to operate the wireless segment 
in february  nextel accepted the terms and conditions of the report and order of the fcc  which implemented a spectrum reconfiguration plan designed to eliminate interference with public safety operators in the mhz band 
under the terms of the report and order  prior to the august  merger date  nextel surrendered certain spectrum rights and received certain other spectrum rights  and undertook to pay the costs incurred by nextel and third parties in connection with the reconfiguration plan  which is required to be completed within a month period  subject to certain exceptions particularly with respect to markets that border mexico and canada 
if  as a result of events within our control  we fail to complete the reconfiguration plan within the month period  we could be subject to actions  which could be material 
based on the fcc s determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered by nextel  the minimum obligation to be incurred under the report and order is billion 
the report and order also provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan  including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions  can be used to offset the minimum obligation of billion  however  we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed that amount 
in addition  a financial reconciliation is required to be completed in at the end of the reconfiguration implementation  at which time we are required to make a payment to the us department of the treasury to the extent that the value of the spectrum rights received exceeds the total of i the value of spectrum rights that are surrendered and ii the qualifying costs referred to above 
as required under the terms of the report and order  we have delivered a billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
although the report and order provides for periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit  no reductions had been made at december  long distance through our long distance segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services targeted to domestic business and residential customers  multinational corporations and other communications companies 
these services include domestic and international voice  data communications using various protocols such as next generation mpls technologies  as well as ip  atm and frame relay  and managed network services 
we also provide services to the cable companies that resell our long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and tier ip networks 
for several years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable companies and internet service providers 
in addition to increased emphasis on selling ip services  we are converting existing customers from atm and frame relay to more advanced ip technologies through a data simplification initiative 
over time  this will result in decreasing revenue from frame relay and atm service offset by increases in ip and other data revenues 
local our local segment consists mainly of regulated incumbent local phone companies serving approximately million access lines in our local service territories in states 
we provide local and long distance voice and data services  including dsl services to customers in these service areas 
we also operate a wholesale telecommunications product distribution business 
for several years  we have experienced declines in the number of access lines that we serve in our local service territories  as a result of competition from cable operators  which provide high speed internet services that can be used as a platform to support voip and wireless providers  as customers completely forego the use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service 
the strategy of our local segment to offset the decline in access lines is to sell a bundled package of products and services to meet the needs of our consumers and business and wholesale customers within our local service territories 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations  either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates 
while management believes that the estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues  revenues generated from handset and accessory sales and revenues from arrangements with our wholesale operators and pcs affiliates  as well as long distance and local voice  data and internet revenues 
revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges  equipment charges  miscellaneous fees such as activation fees  directory assistance  operator assisted calling  equipment protection and late payment charges  and certain regulatory fees 
we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
as a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month  we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns  and represented less than of our accounts receivable balance as of december  certain of our bundled products and services  primarily plans for our wireless segment  are considered to be revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
total consideration received in these arrangements is allocated and measured using units of accounting within the arrangement based on relative fair values 
we classify revenue from sales of handsets as equipment revenue 
we recognize revenue from handset sales when title to the handset passes to the dealer or end user customer 
wireless offerings include wireless phones and service contracts sold together in our company operated stores 
the activation fee revenue associated with these direct sales channels is recognized at the time the related wireless phone is sold  and is classified as equipment sales 
wireless activation fees earned prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
are being deferred and amortized over the estimated average life of the end user customer 
certain activation fees associated with unbundled sales in our wireless segment are deferred and amortized over the estimated average life of the end user customer 
we defer the recognition of certain installation fees related to services provided by our local segment and recognize the revenue over the estimated average life of the customer 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
because of the number of accounts that we have  it is not practical to review the collectibility of each account individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  industry norms  regulatory decisions  and other factors 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate at december  were to change by ten percent  it would represent a change in bad debt expense of million for the wireless segment and million each for the long distance and local segments 
the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts in the results of operations require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage  future returns on asset sales and future access adjustments for disputes with clecs and inter exchange carriers  as well as the future economic viability of our customer base 
management believes the allowance amounts recorded  in each instance  represents its best estimate of future outcomes  but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimate selected  and the impact that changes in actual performance versus these amounts recorded would have on the accounts receivable reported on the balance sheet and the results reported in the statements of operations could be material to our financial condition 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets a significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and definite life intangibles 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
long lived assets consisting of property  plant and equipment represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows long lived assets estimated useful life buildings and improvements to years network equipment and software to years non network internal use software  office equipment and other to years the accounting estimate related to the establishment of depreciable lives requires us to make assumptions about technology evolution and competitive uses of assets 
our assumptions about technology and its future development require significant judgment because the timing and impacts of technology advances are difficult to predict  and actual experience has varied from previous assumptions and could do so in the future 
the impact of changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
we continue to assess the estimated useful life of the iden network assets following our merger with nextel and our future plans for this network 
changes in our estimate of the useful life of the iden network assets could cause depreciation charges in future periods to change in amounts that could be material 
we perform annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for most categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies utilize models that take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  and in certain instances use actuarially determined probabilities to calculate the remaining life of our asset base 
if our studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of a triggering event that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  our views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
in  we recorded million in asset impairment charges primarily related to write downs of various software applications 
in  we determined that business conditions and events impacting our long distance operations constituted an indicator of possible impairment requiring an evaluation of the recoverability of the long distance long lived assets  which resulted in a non cash asset impairment charge of billion  reducing the net carrying value of long distance property  plant and equipment by about to billion at september  additionally  we recognized a non cash charge of million in to adjust the carrying value of our wholesale dial ip assets to fair value 
these impairments represented of long distance s property  plant and equipment  net and of the consolidated property  plant and equipment  net at december  in  we recorded million associated with the termination of our web hosting service and million associated with the terminated development of a new billing platform and a software development project 
valuation and recoverability of intangible assets intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  goodwill and indefinite life intangibles  which primarily consist of our spectrum licenses  are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the net book value of assets of each of our reporting units  identified as our operating segments  to estimates of its respective fair values 
we test indefinite life intangibles for impairment by comparing an asset s respective carrying value to estimates of fair value 
fair value is determined using the direct value method  which requires the use of estimates  judgments and projections 
we performed our annual impairment test of fcc spectrum licenses and goodwill in the fourth quarter and concluded that there was no impairment  as the estimates of fair value of these intangible assets exceeded their carrying values 
the accounting estimates related to goodwill and indefinite life intangibles require us to make assumptions about fair values 
the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions about fair values require significant judgment because economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations can result in variable and volatile fair values 
in addition  a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of a triggering event that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our goodwill or intangible assets 
in  we decided to end pursuit of a residential fixed wireless strategy using certain of our brs spectrum  which resulted in an impairment analysis in which we determined that there had been a decline in our estimate of the fair value of our brs spectrum 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of billion  which reduced the carrying value to million 
we continue to invest in additional ghz spectrum rights  test new technology that could be used to provide services using this spectrum  monitor industry developments and participate in fcc proceedings in an effort to obtain favorable regulatory rulings with respect to this spectrum 
valuation of acquired assets and liabilities in connection with the sprint nextel merger in the third quarter  as required by sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired  including goodwill and spectrum licenses  and liabilities assumed from nextel based on their respective fair values at the merger date 
the approach to the estimation of the fair values of the nextel goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach valuation technique 
we are in the process of finalizing internal studies of the assets acquired in the sprint nextel merger and the acquisitions of us unwired  gulf coast wireless  and iwo holdings  including investments  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  and certain liabilities relevant to the allocation of the purchase price 
the fair values recorded as of december   are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained 
such additional information includes  but may not be limited to  the following valuations and physical counts of property  plant and equipment  plans relative to the disposition of certain assets acquired  exit from certain contractual arrangements and the involuntary termination of employees 
when finalized  we may be required to make adjustments that could impact our results of operations and financial position  some of which could be material 
employee benefit plan assumptions retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business for us  yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of the future benefit costs over the employee s expected tenure with us based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
the accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the discount rate  return on assets  and future health care costs 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost incurred by us 
in determining pension obligations  we are required to develop assumptions for the discount rate and return on plan assets 
these assumptions are subject to market performance  which has fluctuated in the recent past and could have continued volatility in the future 
in selecting our discount rate  our third party actuaries construct a hypothetical portfolio of bonds rated aa or better that produces a cash flow matching the projected benefit payments of the plan 
for the december  measurement date  this exercise produced a range of  and our discount rate was set at  a basis point decrease from december  an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported projected benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate used in in determining the projected benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the projected benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in the benefit costs 
our return on asset assumption is and has not changed since late to determine our assumption for the return on assets  we consider forward looking estimates of the expected long term returns for a portfolio invested according to our target investment policy 
this assumption was initially developed from estimates provided by two investment consulting firms in late when we revised our target asset allocation policy  and is validated each year against estimates provided by our third party actuaries 
if the expected return on assets assumption was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in current year benefit costs 
this assumption is not used in the calculation of the pension projected benefit obligation 
in determining post retirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations  assumptions are made concerning the cost of health care  including medical inflation and discount rates 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed medical inflation rate would generate a million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in benefit costs 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the reported accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate used in in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the obligation as of december  and an immaterial impact on benefit costs 
tax valuation allowances we are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions could be challenged  and the positions may not be fully sustained 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  the expected spin off of embarq  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position 
the accounting estimate related to the tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
we carried an income tax valuation allowance of billion as of december  this amount includes a valuation allowance for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards  subject to utilization restrictions  acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to capital loss  state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
assumption changes that result in a reduction of expected benefits from realization of capital loss  state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards by would increase our valuation allowance by million 
significant new accounting pronouncements sfas no

r  share based payment 
this statement requires an entity to recognize the cost of employee services received in share based payment transactions  through the use of fair value based methods of recognizing cost 
this statement is effective for us as of january  we voluntarily adopted fair value accounting for share based payments effective january   under sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  using the prospective method 
upon adoption  we began expensing the fair value of stock based compensation for all grants  modifications or settlements made on or after january  in connection with the conversion of the pcs common stock into our common stock in the tracking stock recombination  as required by sfas no 
 we accounted for the conversion of options to purchase pcs stock into options to purchase our common stock as a modification and  accordingly  applied stock option expensing to the options to acquire our common stock resulting from the conversion of pcs stock options granted before january  further  in connection with the nextel merger  we accounted for the conversion of nextel stock options to our stock options as a modification and  accordingly  applied stock option expensing to the unvested stock options beginning on the merger date 
the revised standard will require us to begin to recognize compensation cost for unvested common stock options granted to our employees before january   which are outstanding as of january  the requirement to recognize expense on these unvested grants is expected to be immaterial to us 
sfas no

results of operations consolidated year ended december  in millions net operating revenues net income loss the discussion of our results of operations for the year ended december  includes the financial results of nextel for the last days of the year  consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the inclusion of these results renders direct comparisons with results for prior periods less meaningful 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses  where appropriate  trends we believe are significant  separate and apart from the impact of the merger with nextel 
net operating revenues increased in  reflecting growth in revenues of our wireless and local segments  partially offset by declining revenues of our long distance segment 
operating expenses increased in primarily due to increases in the operating expenses of our wireless segment  partially offset by a decrease in the operating expenses of our long distance segment 
in  we recorded merger and integration costs of million 
merger and integration costs are generally non recurring in nature and primarily include charges for costs to adopt and launch a new branding strategy and logos  including costs to re brand company owned stores and facilities  costs to train customer facing employees and prepare systems for the launch of the common customer interfacing systems  processes and other integration planning and execution costs  and costs related to employee retention and involuntary separations of employees 
these merger and integration costs were primarily related to our merger with nextel and the planned spin off of embarq 
merger and integration costs have primarily been reflected as unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative expenses and  therefore  are excluded from segment results 
in  we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
asset impairment charges primarily related to the write down of various software applications  including a million impairment charge related to the write off and removal from service of certain internal use software systems that are no longer utilized by our local segment 
we also incurred asset impairments arising from the hurricanes in the gulf coast region  but these asset impairments were substantially offset by insurance recoveries 
in  we also recorded hurricane related charges of million exclusive of the asset impairment charges 
approximately million  million and million of these charges were reflected on the wireless  long distance and local segments  respectively 
in  we recorded income of million related to activities associated with various equity method investments and marketable securities transactions 
this income is primarily the result of our recording million of equity in earnings associated with our ownership interest in nextel partners  the majority of which related to a release by nextel partners of a significant portion of its deferred tax valuation allowance in the third quarter in  we recorded net restructuring and asset impairment charges of billion primarily related to the impairment of our long distance property  plant and equipment and severance costs associated with our organizational realignment initiatives and the termination of the web hosting service 
in  we recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments of billion  which consisted of impairment charges associated with the decline in our estimates of fair value of certain of our brs spectrum  other asset impairments  facilities and severance charges associated with the termination of our web hosting service  impairment charges associated with the termination of development of a new billing platform  impairment charges associated with the termination of software development projects  and severance costs associated with our transformation to a customer focused organizational design  partially offset by the finalization of all and restructuring liabilities 
segmental results of operations certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
in  we determined that recategorization of certain costs from costs of services and products to selling  general and administrative would be more consistent with current industry practices  and accordingly reclassified billion of expenses in each of the years ended december  and these costs primarily consist of certain customer care and information technology costs for the wireless and long distance segments 
wireless through our wireless segment  we  together with the remaining pcs affiliates and nextel partners  offer digital wireless service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands and provide wireless coverage in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas  to more than million people 
combined with the pcs affiliates  nextel partners and our mvno wholesale resellers  we served more than million subscribers at the end of we provide a comprehensive suite of advanced wireless services  including digital wireless mobile telephone service  instant national and international walkie talkie capabilities and wireless data transmission services 
these services are provided using two networks  the cdma technology based network that was operated by us prior to the nextel merger and the iden technology based network that was operated by nextel prior to the merger 
we plan to develop handsets that are capable of operating on both of these networks  which is expected to enhance the services available to our customers 
we expect to take other actions to capture capital and operating efficiencies as the network operations are combined 
we offer wireless international voice roaming around the globe 
international roaming is available with a pcs tri mode cdma analog phone in areas of more than countries  including countries in the asia pacific  south american and caribbean regions  as well as canada and mexico 
international roaming is also available with a gsm capable phone in over countries in europe  the middle east  africa and the south pacific rim 
we also have roaming or interoperability agreements with iden based wireless service providers that operate in latin america and canada 
we are continuing to execute our plans that will enable us to offer faster wireless data speeds by deploying ev do technology across the cdma network 
with peak rates of up to megabits per second for downloads  ev do will accelerate average mobile device data speeds up to times when compared to the prior generation technology 
this technology is expected to deliver superior application and service performance on ev do capable handsets and laptops equipped with ev do enabled sprint pcs connection cards 
our first commercial rollout of ev do was in the second quarter and subsequent rollouts will continue to expand our footprint to provide coverage to more people and markets

wholesale  affiliate and other revenues consist primarily of net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in pcs affiliate territories and revenues from the sale of wireless services to companies that resell those services to their subscribers 
service revenues increased  million or from to primarily due to the merger with nextel and the increase in the number of our direct subscribers  while our average monthly service revenue per user remained flat 
we had million direct net subscriber additions in  excluding nextel or pcs affiliate subscriber additions that occurred prior to the sprint nextel merger and the acquisitions of us unwired  gulf coast wireless and iwo holdings  and ended the year with million direct subscribers 
we believe that the growth in direct subscribers  separate from the growth attributable to subscribers gained as part of the sprint nextel merger and pcs affiliate acquisitions  is the result of a number of factors  principally our differentiating products and services  particularly data related services such as nationwide walkie talkie services  sprint powervision  instant messaging and emails  sending and receiving pictures  playing games with full color graphics and polyphonic sounds and browsing the internet wirelessly  the introduction of more competitive service pricing plans which are targeted at meeting more of our customers needs  selected handset pricing promotions and improved handset choices  increased brand name recognition as a result of increased advertising and marketing campaigns  including advertising and marketing related to our sponsorship of nascar and our agreement with the nfl that began in  increased market penetration as a result of opening additional retail stores and selling efforts targeted at specific vertical markets  and the improvement in subscriber retention  which we believe is attributable to the impact of competitive rate plans  as well as our focus on delivering high quality and differentiated service 
our average monthly service revenue per user remained stable at in and as we integrated nextel subscribers  who have a higher average monthly service revenue  in the third quarter  we saw an increase in revenues from data services  as subscribers used more short message service  or sms  text messaging and took advantage of our wider array of premium services  and we experienced a full year of increased equipment protection plan rates that were restructured in  these increases were offset as we continued to offer more competitive service pricing plans  including lower priced plans  plans with a higher number of bundled minutes included in the fixed monthly charge for the plan  plans that offer the ability to share minutes among a group of related customers  or a combination of these features 
we expect that service revenues will increase in absolute terms in the future as a result of an increasing subscriber base 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we and our competitors have decreased prices while the average per subscriber utilization of wireless voice services has increased  resulting in both declining average monthly revenue per subscriber in the wireless industry overall and in declining average revenue per minute of use for voice services  and we expect these trends will continue

we continued to lower our handset retail prices in as costs of handsets declined  and we also changed our third party compensation plan in from one that was based on discounted handsets to one that is commissions based 
additionally  we continued offering rebates on handsets as new promotional programs were rolled out 
consistent with industry practice  our marketing plans assume that handsets  net of rebates  will continue to be sold at prices below cost in most instances 
our retention efforts  which often include providing incentives in the form of new handsets  may cause our handset subsidies to increase as our customer base continues to grow

financing activities for also include million in proceeds from common stock issuances  primarily resulting from exercises of employee stock options 
proceeds from common stock issuances of billion in were mainly from the settlement of equity unit forward contracts 
we paid cash dividends of million in compared with million in the decrease in cash dividends paid is due to a decrease in the dividend rate in the third quarter to cents per share from cents per share in prior quarters 
this was partially offset by an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding in  primarily as a result of the nextel merger  compared to capital requirements  contractual obligations and funding sources capital requirements we currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will principally relate to operating expenses relating to our networks  capital expenditures  particularly with respect to the expansion of the coverage and capacity of our wireless networks and the deployment of new technologies in those networks  interest and scheduled principal payments related to our debt and any purchases or redemptions of our debt or other securities  dividend payments as declared by our board of directors  which we plan to continue following the spin off of embarq  amounts required to fund pending acquisition transactions  including the purchase of all outstanding shares of common stock of nextel partners that we do not own for about billion  amounts required to be expended in connection with the fcc s report and order  and other potential investments in new business opportunities and spectrum purchases  potential costs of compliance with regulatory mandates  including e  and other general corporate expenditures 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under gaap currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
future contractual obligations total and thereafter in millions long term debt redeemable preferred stock capital leases operating leases acquisitions purchase obligations and other total includes principal maturities and estimated interest payments for the bank credit facility based on management s expectation as to future interest rates  assume the current payment schedule and exclude any additional drawdown under the revolving loan commitment 
includes the effect of our fourth quarter decision to defease and redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
amounts do not reflect the impact of our february  notice to redeem our seventh series preferred stock  which we expect to take place on march  includes amounts that we are required to pay to purchase the remaining equity interest in nextel partners that we do not currently own  including amounts payable upon conversion of debt securities and upon settlement of options  as of december   we held approximately of the common stock equity interest in nextel partners 
amounts do not include any debt to be assumed as part of this transaction 
includes obligations related to our acquisitions of alamosa  enterprise communications and velocita that we announced in the fourth quarter amounts associated with our alamosa acquisition do not include any debt assumed as part of the transaction 
the table above does not include the costs to be paid in connection with the report and order over the next approximately two and one half years 
the total minimum cash obligation is approximately billion 
costs incurred under the report and order associated with the reconfiguration of the mhz band may be applied against the billion obligation  subject to approval by the transition administrator under the report and order 
in addition  costs associated with the reconfiguration of the ghz spectrum are not fully approved for credit until the completion of the entire reconfiguration process 
because the final reconciliation and audit of the entire reconfiguration obligation outlined in the report and order will not take place until after the completion of all aspects of the reconfiguration process  there can be no assurance that we will be given full credit for the expenditures that we have incurred under the report and order 
additionally  since we  the transition administrator and the fcc have not yet reached an agreement on our methodology for calculating certain amounts of property  plant and equipment to be submitted for credit  we cannot provide assurance that we will be granted full credit for certain of these network costs 
as of december   we had incurred  on a cash basis  approximately million of costs under the report and order 
the above table excludes amounts that may be paid or will be paid in connection with spectrum acquisitions 
we have committed  subject to certain conditions  which may not be met  to pay up to about million for pending spectrum acquisitions 
in addition  we had about billion of open purchase orders for goods or services as of december  that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  but were not recorded as liabilities as of december  or included in the table above 
we expect substantially all of these commitments to become due in the next twelve months 
included in the purchase obligations and other caption are minimum amounts due under some of our service contracts  including agreements for telecommunications and customer billing services  advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include items such as hours contracted  subscribers  and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
expected pension contributions are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k and have not been included in unconditional purchase obligations 
funding sources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion 
we have two credit agreements  each with a syndicate of banks 
the first  a billion unsecured credit agreement entered into in december  is comprised of a year billion revolving credit facility and a day billion term loan 
the full billion term loan was borrowed at closing and used to refinance an existing nextel credit facility 
as of december   about billion of letters of credit are outstanding under the new billion revolving credit facility 
as a result  approximately billion is available under the new facility 
the second credit agreement is a billion unsecured facility  structured as a day revolving credit facility expiring in june  with a subsequent one year  billion term out option  none of which has been drawn 
the credit agreements described above provide for interest rates equal to the libor or the prime rate plus a spread that varies depending on the applicable borrower s or guarantor s credit ratings 
none of these facilities includes rating triggers that would allow the lenders involved to terminate the facilities in the event of a credit rating downgrade 
we had letters of credit of million as of december   in addition to the billion letter of credit related to the report and order 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants  including all financial ratio tests  associated with our borrowings 
our ability to fund our capital needs is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms of the bank and securities markets 
given the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable capital structure cost 
off balance sheet financing we do not participate in  or secure  financings for any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
we do have bankruptcy remote entities that are included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
future outlook we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next months by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities on hand  cash expected to be received by us in connection with the spin off of embarq  and or cash available under our existing credit facilities 
in making this assessment  we have considered anticipated levels of capital expenditures  obligations related to pending acquisition transactions  including the outstanding shares of common stock of nextel partners that we do not own for about billion  anticipated payments under the fcc s report and order  declared and anticipated dividend payments and scheduled debt service requirements  costs associated with the sprint nextel merger and spin off of embarq  and other future contractual obligations 
if there are material changes in our business plans  or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability  anticipated cash needs could change significantly 
the conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next months as described above does not take into account any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum other than those currently being pursued by us  potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt and equity securities for cash  and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates  including regulations related to e service 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources  including existing cash on hand  borrowings available under existing credit facilities and funding anticipated to be received in connection with the spin off of the local telecommunications business 
if existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs  it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that cannot currently be predicted with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  the market prices of our securities  and tax law restrictions related to the spin off of embarq that may limit our ability to raise capital from the sale of our equity securities 
we have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing arrangements that have been consummated or are described in this report  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital 
the entirety of the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and part i  item a 
risk factors 
financial strategies general risk management policies we use derivative instruments only for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activity may be done for purposes of mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  the selection of only the most creditworthy counterparties  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
we also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 
our board of directors has authorized us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with our risk management policies 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instrument for speculative purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk include the risk of increasing interest rates on short term debt  the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings  and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancing using long term fixed rate debt 
cash flow hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were designated as fair value hedges 
approximately of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
as of december   we held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of billion 
these swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes 
these interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from to on a semiannual basis  we pay a floating rate of interest equal to the six month libor plus a fixed spread and receive an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes 
on december   the rate we would pay averaged and the rate we would receive was 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve  the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by million 
these interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules as all of the critical terms of the swaps perfectly matched the corresponding terms of the hedged debt  therefore  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt including interest rate swaps 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our statements of operations and cash flows as of december  while our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair values 
we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in fair market value of our debt to billion 
this analysis includes the hedged debt 
we have entered into a series of interest rate collars associated with the anticipated issuance of debt by embarq at the time of its expected spin off in these collars have been designated as cash flow hedges in embarq s financial statements against the variability in interest payments that would result from a change in interest rates before the debt is issued at the time of spin off 
however  because the forecasted interest payments of debt will occur after the subsidiary is spun off  the derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in our consolidated financial statements  and so any changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
based on market prices on december   a one percentage point change in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of these instruments by approximately million 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be less than million 
equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  include equity method investments  investments in private securities  available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments 
we entered into a series of option contracts associated with our investment in nii holdings in order to hedge the price risk associated with this security 
the first of these contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
based on these contracts and market prices on december   a increase or decrease in nii holdings market price would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million 
changes in the market price will also affect the fair value of our holdings in nii holdings  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses unless the investment is sold 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k for further detail of these derivative instruments 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments 
during and  we entered into variable prepaid forward contracts to monetize equity securities held as available for sale 
the derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in expected cash flows related to the forecasted sale of the underlying equity securities 
these prepaid contracts were settled between the fourth quarter and fourth quarter
