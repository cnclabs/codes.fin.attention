item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this annual report of form k 
we are an independent oil and gas enterprise with interests primarily in the maverick basin in southwest texas  and the marfa basin of west texas  with a consistent record of long term growth in proved oil and gas reserves  leasehold acreage position  production and cash flow through our established exploration and development programs 
our business strategy is to build shareholder value by acquiring undeveloped mineral interests and internally developing a multi year drilling inventory through the use of advanced technologies  such as d seismic and horizontal drilling 
we account for our oil and gas operations under the successful efforts method of accounting and trade our common stock on the nasdaq capital market sm under the symbol txco 
we currently have three drilling rigs under operation on our extensive  acre position in the maverick basin 
we expect to begin exploration activities in the marfa basin in the third quarter of completions in included oil and six gas wells  which included three re entries  while wells spud during the year remained in progress at year end 
eight of the completions were later transferred in the asset sale 
current emphasis is on the glen rose  georgetown and san miguel formations 
the capital expenditures budget includes funds for wells in the glen rose  in the georgetown  in the san miguel  eight in the pearsall  as well as funds for seismic and lease acquisitions 
due to the number of promising prospects on our maverick basin acreage  as well as higher oil and gas prices  drilling activity remained high during for further discussion of this activity  see the 
principal areas of activity and 
drilling activity sections of this form k 
the increased expenditures should translate into continued increases to reserves as adequate production history is established 
revenues and credit capacity for future activity should continue to grow as the result of the increased drilling activity 
recognition of additional reserves for newly drilled wells requires a period of sustained production  causing a delay between the expenditures and the recording of reserves 
we reported net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for the prior year 
the primary contributor to this improvement was the million pre tax gain on the sale of selected interests in the maverick basin to encana oil gas usa inc higher average sales prices also contributed to the improvement  partially offset by decreased margin on gas gathering activities  slightly lower production on an equivalent unit basis  and increases in lease operating expenses  depreciation and depletion 
these factors are discussed in the 
results of operations section 
we continued our ongoing trend of annual reserve growth in by recording net proved reserve additions of bcfe 
combined with annual production of bcfe and reserves sold of bcfe  our gross reserve additions for the year were bcfe 
estimated year end proved oil and gas reserves were a record bcfe  above the at year end we achieved a all source reserve replacement rate in positive cash flow provided from operations totaled million  a decrease from the prior year primarily due to losses on the termination of hedges of natural gas and increased income taxes after the asset sale

the reserve replacement ratio is calculated by dividing proved reserve additions  which includes extensions and discoveries  revisions to previous estimates and reserves purchased  as the numerator  by the sales volumes for the year as the denominator 
for the drill bit only ratio  any purchased reserves are excluded from the numerator 
see discussion regarding risk factors included in 
part i  item a of this form k 
see the discussion below regarding how management uses this information and potential time horizons for realization of these reserves 
asset sale in  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with encana oil gas usa inc encana to sell selected interests in our maverick basin interest effective september   for million 
encana acquired interests in approximately  gross acres across the southern portion of our maverick basin acreage  excluding the glen rose formation under the entire block and the san miguel formation in the pena creek field 
encana also received of our interest in approximately  gross acres across the northern portion of our maverick basin acreage below the glen rose formation  including the pearsall and jurassic formations 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves at june   and of our existing production at september   were transferred in this sale 
at closing  our future working interest wi in the oil and gas rights attributable to the glen rose formation increased to across the acreage block acquired in the asset exchange with arrow river energy lp and cmr energy lp in february  and to on the comanche ranch leaseblock 
we retained our wi in the san miguel formation on pena creek field  as well as our extensive gas gathering and transmission pipeline assets 
a pre tax gain of million was recognized on this transaction in the third quarter 
proceeds from the transaction were used to redeem the preferred stock for million and pay down million on the credit facility effective september  additionally  funds were used to terminate derivative contracts on natural gas for november through april  requiring a cash payment of approxim ately million that substantially offset the accrued derivative obligations recorded in the first three quarters of funds were also used to acquire leasehold interests in the marfa basin of west texas 
subsequent acquisition on march   we closed on the purchase of a drilling rig and other personal property and equipment from ada energy services  llc 
the consideration for the purchase was million 
reserve replacement historically  we add proved reserves through both drilling and acquisition activities 
we believe we will continue to add reserves each year  however  external factors beyond our control  such as governmental regulations and commodity market factors  could limit our ability to drill wells and acquire proved properties in the future 
we calculate and analyze reserve replacement ratios to use as benchmarks against our competitors 
oil and gas companies are judged by their management and the investing public by their effectiveness in replacing annual production  hence the need for these ratios 
the ratios are limited in use by the inherent uncertainties in the reserve estimation process and other factors 
our reserve additions for each year are estimates 
reserve volumes can change over time  and therefore cannot be absolutely known or verified until all volumes have been produced and a cumulative production total for a well or field can be calculated 
many factors will impact the ability to access these reserves  such as availability of capital  new and existing government regulations  competition within the industry  the requirement of new or upgraded infrastructure at the production site  and technological advances 
see 
risk factors part i  item a for further discussion of risks and uncertainties related to reserves 
the reserve report prepared by independent reservoir engineers and used for both the pv value and the standardized measure  indicates the last year of production is estimated as however  as shown in the 
table in item of this form k  we expect to realize approximately of that production by year end capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measure of ability to access cash 
our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties  repayment of contractual obligations and working capital funding 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit  sale of non strategic assets  and more recently through the 
credit facility 
the prices for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  the refore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that projected operating cash flows  cash on hand  and borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the requirements of our business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
no assurances can be made that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain our planned levels of capital expenditures or that we will not increase capital expenditures 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to drilling results  product pricing and future acquisition and divestitures of properties 
bank credit facility we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility with guaranty bank the facility or credit facility 
the facility was entered into in and expires in june it replaced our prior million credit facility with hibernia national bank  which was scheduled to mature in the credit facility is collateralized by all of our proven oil and gas properties  had an initial borrowing base of million  based on then current levels of our oil and gas reserves  and features semi annual redeterminations 
the borrowing base was subsequently increased based on reserves  and amendments were made during that modified the covenant terms and extended the termination date through june at december   the borrowing base  inclusive of traunche a and traunche b  stood at million 
the unused borrowing base at march   was million  with million outstanding at an average interest rate of 
interest under the facility is based on  at our option  a the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to or b prime plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the facility provides the lender a commitment fee equal to  per annum on the unused borrowing base 
the facility contains additional terms and conditions consistent with similarly positioned companies 
these conditions include various restrictive covenants such as minimum levels of interest coverage  tangible net worth and current ratio  a maximum debt to ebitdax ratio  restricting the payment of dividends other than the dividends payable under the redeemable preferred stock  and prohibiting a change of control or incurring additional debt 
the facility s requirement for hedging a percentage of production  when borrowing under the facility exceeded of the borrowing base was removed during at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
capital requirements outlook overall we believe the facility  along with our positive cash flow from existing production and anticipated production increases from new drilling  will provide adequate capital to fund operating cash requirements and complete our scheduled exploration and development goals for we expect to further increase our borrowing base commensurate with the expected growth of our proved oil and gas reserves throughout the base term of the facility 
should product prices weaken  or expected new oil and gas production levels not be attained  the resulting reduction in projected revenues would cause us to re evaluate our working capital options and would adversely affect our ability to carry out our current operating plans 
the major components of our plans  and the requirements for additional capital for  include the following maverick basin activity initial capital expenditures for are planned to be in the range of million to million and target our maverick basin core properties  primarily for drilling wells 
million is earmarked for seismic and leasehold enhancements and other infrastructure expansion activities 
our budgeted capital expenditures are intended to be flexible 
the budget may expand or contract based on drilling results  operational developments  drilling rig availability  unanticipated transaction opportunities  market conditions  commodity price fluctuations and working capital availability 
we plan to drill or re enter wells  including glen rose wells including porosity zone oil wells  georgetown wells  san miguel oil wells and eight pearsall wells 
the porosity wells include new wells and four re entries 
other companies will operate some of these wells and  therefore  we do not have direct control over when they will be drilled or what final costs will actually be incurred

we are seeking a partner and expect to begin exploration activities in the third quarter of no funds were included in the initial capex budget for this area 
however  we expect to increase the capex budget to include one or two wells once our partner is determined 
williston basin activity we plan to maintain our existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected undeveloped leases  with scheduled delay rentals of  we will continue to offer remaining acreage  seismic data  and identified prospects to other industry operators 
we participated in the drilling of one well in the williston basin during and anticipate additional activity during no funds are included in our capex budget for this area 
sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for  down from million for the decline is largely due to a one time cash outlay in excess of million for the termination of derivative contracts 
this is coupled with increased federal and state income taxes resulting from the asset sale of million

total revenues for increased by million compared to natural gas sales volumes decreased by mmcf while oil sales volumes increased by  barrels of oil bo  mmcfe  as compared with the prior year 
gas gathering revenues increased by million over levels 
the decrease in natural gas sales volumes was primarily due to the sale of interests in certain georgetown wells as part of the encana sale  as well as normal declines experienced in maturing gas wells 
the increase in oil sales volumes compared to the prior year reflects the increase in our interests on most glen rose wells drilled following the encana transaction  as well as the resumption of drilling in the glen rose porosity play after delays in the prior year due to a partner s restructuring 
on an equivalent unit basis  prices averaged higher in as compared to crude oil prices averaged higher while natural gas prices were up 
average higher prices for  as compared to  had a million positive impact on revenues in commodity prices have been  and continue to be  volatile

average daily net gas sales in were mmcf  a decrease from the prior year  as the result of producing wells sold and normal production declines on maturing wells 
average daily net oil production rates in were  bbls  a increase from the prior year  primarily as a result of our increased working interest in new glen rose formation wells 
lease operating expense for increased million  from million in to million in  an increase 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of new oil wells during the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including the usual costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges 
operating expense per mcfe increased from in to in typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is  an increase of from the prior year 
also  included in operating costs is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs totaled  in and  in the cbm wells are in the dewatering phase and therefore have little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in we s old a interest in most of our cbm properties in february and the remaining of the same properties in september pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  we periodically assess our producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments decreased by primarily due to higher expected cash flows 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  over consistent with the number of newly drilled producing wells being depleted 
the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including computer  pipeline and well service equipment additions 
the increase in amortization primarily reflects the acquisition of d seismic and additional loan fees 
gas gathering operations revenues increased in as compared to related operating expenses increased from these increases are consistent with the increased number of gas wells connected to the gathering system compared to the prior period  as well as higher average commodity prices 
see the table on the previous page 
while general and administrative costs increased when compared to levels  they declined to of revenues 
this compares favorably to when general and administrative expenses were of revenues 
the higher level of absolute dollar costs reflects our higher sustained level of operations 
the increase also reflects higher salaries  benefits  and office related expenses for a full year related to three employees hired across the organization during  along with a partial year for two new employees hired during also contributing to the increase were higher costs for sarbanes oxley compliance and franchise taxes 
the prior year also included a  non cash compensation charge relating to one year extensions of the expiration date for a non qualified option and warrant 
increases in general and administrative costs are consistent with the expanded compliance burden mandated by the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act in mid  see sarbanes oxley section implementation for additional discussion 
these particular costs are likely to continue to increase as the compliance burden expands 
the increase in interest income reflects higher average cash levels in interest bearing accounts  primarily after the asset sale 
interest expense was essentially flat in as compared to due to higher average debt levels in the first nine months of the year  prior to the asset sale 
proceeds from that sale essentially eliminated our debt 
the derivative mark to market loss of million represents the million unrealized fair value loss at year end on oil hedges and the reversal of a million unrealized fair value gain at december   while the million derivative settlements loss reflects the termination of gas hedges during october and cash settlements for closed periods 
both are for hedges accounted for as investments 
compared to we reported a net income of million  per basic share and per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net income of million or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
total revenues for increased by million compared to natural gas sales volumes increased by mmcf while oil sales volumes declined by  bo as compared with the prior year 
gas gathering revenues increased by million over levels 
the increase in natural gas sales volumes was primarily due to pena creek  georgetown and chittim glen rose horizontal wells placed on production in the decline in oil sales volumes compared to the prior year reflects the delay in drilling in the glen rose porosity play due to a partner s restructuring

average daily net gas sales rates in increased to mmcf  a increase from the prior year  as production from new wells greatly exceeded the normal decline in aging gas well production 
average daily net oil sales rates in decreased to bbls  a decline from the prior year  primarily as a result of the delay in drilling mentioned above 
lease operating expense for increased million  from million in to million in  a increase 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of new oil wells and new natural gas wells during the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including the usual costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges 
operating expense per mcfe increased from in to in typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is  an increase of from the prior year 
also  included in operating costs is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs totaled approximately million in both and the cbm wells were in the dewatering phase and therefore had little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  we periodically assess our producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments decreased by primarily due to lower impairment rates 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted for wells added through the drill bit 
the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including computer  pipeline and well service equipment additions 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the acquisition of d seismic and additional loan fees 
gas gathering operations revenues increased in as compared to related operating expenses increased from these increases were consistent with the increased number of gas wells connected to the gathering system compared to the prior period  as well as higher average sales prices 
while general and administrative costs increased when compared to levels  they represented only of revenues

also contributing to the increase were higher costs for public company and investor relations related expenses  and professional services 
increases in general and administrative costs are consistent with the expanded compliance burden mandated by the adoption of the sarbanes oxley ac t in mid  see sarbanes oxley section implementation for additional discussion 
these particular costs are likely to continue to increase as the compliance burden expands 
the increase in interest income reflects slightly higher average cash levels in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense increased by million in from due to higher average debt levels  reflecting a full year of interest on the 
redeemable preferred stock issued in august and slightly higher average interest rates on the credit facility 
a portion of the interest expense is a non cash accrual reflecting the accretion of the liability on the preferred stock to its full redemption value  which is classified as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the derivative fair value loss of  represents the net of the unrealized fair value gain at december  of million and the million in cash settlements for closed periods 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of our future payments on obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in 
note a to the audited consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to reserves  depletion and impairment of oil and gas properties  and the ultimate utilization of the deferred tax asset  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other as sumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements successful efforts method of accounting we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells  costs to acquire mineral interests and d seismic costs are capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses including d seismic costs and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense  net of salvage value  if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
when an entire interest in an unproved property is sold  a gain or loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the property and the sales price 
if a partial interest in an unproved property is sold  the amount received is treated as a reduction of the cost of the interest retained 
on the sale of an entire or partial interest in a proved property  the asset is relieved along with the corresponding accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
when compared with the sales price a resulting gain or loss is recognized in income 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and ultimately deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment or recompletion of the wells at later dates 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with referen ce to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and gas field that will be the focus of future development 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
these factors and assumptions include historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future o perating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures  with respect to our reserves  will likely vary from estimates and such variances may be material 
we contract with independent engineering firms to provide reserve estimates for reporting purposes 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review our oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties 
we have recognized impairments in both the current and prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future 
income taxes we are subject to income and other similar taxes on our operations 
estimates are required when recording income tax expense or benefit 
these estimates are necessary because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of the year  b tax returns are subject to audits that can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing for recognition of income tax expenses or benefits 
during  we utilized the federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences available from prior years to reduce our current taxes 
we routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized  or if likely realization may be many years in the future 
a valuation allowance was not required at december  commodity hedging contracts all of our price risk management transactions are considered derivative instruments and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these derivative instruments are intended to hedge our price risk and may be considered hedges for economic purposes  but certain of these transactions may or may not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
all derivative instrument contracts are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we have elected to account for certain of our derivative contracts as investments as set out under sfas no 
therefore  the changes in fair value in those contracts are recorded immediately as unrealized gains or losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
the change in fair value for the effective portion of contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recognized as other comprehensive income loss as a component in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement r  share based payment  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the sec further delayed the effective date of this fasb statement 
we adopted the statement effective january  we expect to record compensation expense of approximately million during for options currently granted 
there are no currently outstanding options or warrants for which compensation expense will be recorded after however  we granted restricted stock in january to directors and employees that will result in compensation expense of approximately million in  million in  and million in in april  the fasb issued fsp fas to amend sfas  financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the amendment allows continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year from the completion of drilling under certain circumstances 
circumstances for continued capitalization require that the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
fsp fas also amended sfas to require enhanced disclosures of suspended exploratory well costs in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted the new requirements during the second quarter of the adoption of fsp fas did not impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sarbanes oxley section implementation presented in item a of this annual report is the second management report on internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires this report 
in anticipation of the extensive work involved with complying with these requirements for the first time  in late our board of directors authorized management to engage an outside consulting firm to assist management in this project 
in january  after interviewing several firms  management and the board selected grant thornton llp to assist with the project 
grant thornton assisted management with the review and update of existing documentation of internal controls  and facilitated the necessary steps to complete the evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of these controls for management and the board have a long standing commitment to excellence in compliance and controls 
this created an environment that fostered good control practices 
a number of improvements to process flo w were made during  primarily related to systems 
for  we completed the work with the help of contract labor and again found our system of internal controls adequate and effective 
no material changes to internal controls over financial reporting were necessary during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices have fluctuated significantly over the last five years and such volatility is expected to continue  and the range of such price movement is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
while we have been party to forward sale contracts from time to time in the past  no such forward sale agreements were in place for or however  we had in place ratio swap agreements that hedged approximately of our monthly production as of the inception of the hedge on october  these swap agreements expired in october in march and june of  we entered into additional financial price hedges  extending coverage for the similar monthly volumes through april of we had natural gas derivatives covering november through april in place for a portion of these gas hedges were terminated in october with a total cash payment of approximately million 
the remaining hedges are described in the table below 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on our annual revenues based on sales volumes 
derivative contracts at year end price volumes per transaction date transaction type beginning ending per unit per month crude oil fixed price swap  bbl fixed price swap  bbl the fair value of our outstanding transactions is presented on the balance sheet by counterparty 
the balance is shown as current or long term based on management s estimate of the amounts that will be due in the relevant time periods at currently predicted price levels 
we entered into monthly basis swaps mbs  for two months in  to cover price exposure for certain new physical purchase contracts that used an average daily gas price rather than the first of the month index prices 
the mbs agreements were established at the beginning of each month for the purchase volume expected at the daily gas price for the month 
no receivable or payable for the settlement of those contracts remains on the consolidated balance sheets 
the net gain on the contract reduced gas gathering operations expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
effective october   we amended the contracts to use first of the month index prices  therefore we no longer use mbs contracts 
the consolidated balance sheet at december   includes a total liability for derivative mark to market losses of million divided between the accrued derivative obligation current and accrued derivative obligation long term line items  as well as a million liability for derivative settlements payable in the current liabilities section 
a derivative mark to market loss of million was recognized on the consolidated statement of operations in at the end of february  the valuation of the remaining hedges is an unrealized liability of approximately million 
interest rate risk we have borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility with guaranty bank  with interest based on libor rates plus an applicable margin 
at march   we had million in total borrowings under the facility  with an average interest rate of 
at our current borrowing level  an annualized fluctuation in interest charged on the floating rate balance at march   would have negligible impact on our annual net income 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents are cash investment funds that are placed with a major financial institution 
substantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil and gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
historically  we have not experienced any significant credit losses on such receivables
