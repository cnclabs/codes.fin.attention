item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the m f worldwide consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company has two business lines  which are operated by mafco worldwide and clarke american 
mafco worldwide s business is the production of licorice products for sale to the tobacco  food  pharmaceutical and confectionery industries which is the company s licorice products segment 
clarke american s business is providing checks  check related products and services  and direct marketing services 
clarke american s business consists of two divisions the financial institution division  which is focused on financial institution clients and their customers the company s financial institution segment  and the direct to consumer division  which is focused on individual customers the company s direct to consumer segment 
licorice products mafco worldwide is the world s largest producer of licorice products 
mafco worldwide produces a variety of licorice products from licorice root  intermediary licorice extracts produced by others and certain other ingredients at its facilities in the united states  france and the people s republic of china 
approximately of mafco worldwide s licorice sales are to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco 
while licorice represents a small percentage of the total cost of manufacturing american blend cigarettes and other tobacco products  the particular formulation and quality used by each brand is an important element in the brand s quality 
in addition  mafco worldwide manufactures and sells natural products for use in the tobacco industry 
over the last several years  the rate of consumption of tobacco products has declined in the united states 
although mafco worldwide has experienced recent sales declines to the domestic tobacco industry  mafco worldwide s increased sales to the international tobacco industry have been aided by stable to slightly growing consumption of tobacco products outside of the united states along with a shift of production to facilities overseas by several large customers 
mafco worldwide also sells licorice worldwide to confectioners  food processors  cosmetic companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers for use as flavoring and masking agents  including its magnasweet brand flavor enhancer  which is used in various brands of chewing gum  lip balm  energy bars  non carbonated beverages  chewable vitamins  aspirin and other products 
although mafco worldwide s licorice sales to its confectionary customers have experienced some decline in recent years  licorice sales to food  cosmetic and pharmaceutical customers  who use magnasweet as a flavoring or masking agent  have experienced some growth and added to mafco worldwide s overall sales stability for its licorice products 
one important facet of mafco worldwide s business strategy is to focus on growing its business through sales of licorice derived products for use in non tobacco related applications 
mafco worldwide is devoting a substantial portion of its research and development efforts to magnasweet and its potential food and beverage applications as well as to finding additional uses for components of licorice extract in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products 
mafco worldwide also sells licorice root residue as garden mulch under the name right dress 
other non licorice product sales have decreased due to mafco worldwide s decision to discontinue selling these products 
mafco worldwide considers revenue from international business to be that revenue which is generated outside the united states 
the clarke american acquisition on october   m f worldwide and honeywell entered into a stock purchase agreement in which m f worldwide agreed to purchase of the capital stock of novar  a wholly owned subsidiary of honeywell and the indirect parent of the business of clarke american  for a cash purchase price of million  subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
in connection with this acquisition  referred to as the acquisition  m f worldwide formed ca investment corp  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of m f worldwide 
the business of clarke american was owned by novar  which indirectly wholly owned the operating subsidiaries of the clarke american business 
in connection with the acquisition  novar and its subsidiaries completed a series of merger transactions to eliminate certain intermediate holding companies 
concurrent with the acquisition  novar and ca investment corp 
completed a series of merger transactions  with ca investment corp 
as the surviving entity 
on december   ca investment corp 
purchased of the capital stock of novar and was renamed clarke american corp 
in connection with the acquisition to fund the purchase price and approximately million of expenses for the acquisition and the related financings

clarke american issued million of senior notes due as a result of the higher leverage  the company s interest expense will be significantly higher in periods after the completion of the acquisition than in prior periods 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which resulted in valuations for clarke american s consolidated assets and liabilities based on fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
these valuations are preliminary and will be finalized within one year after the closing of the acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price in the acquisition will result in higher depreciation and amortization expense in the periods following the acquisition compared to prior periods 
in connection with the acquisition  honeywell agreed to indemnify the company for losses caused by breaches of honeywell s representations  warranties and covenants  pre closing taxes and other specified matters described in the stock purchase agreement 
claims for breaches of representations and warranties must be brought by the company by december  and are generally subject to a deductible basket of million and a cap of million  except that claims related to certain environmental matters  taxes and the capitalization of novar and its subsidiaries survive for longer periods of time and are not subject to any deductible basket or cap 
certain representations regarding corporate authorization of the transactions  capitalization  the sophistication of the parties and the nonreliance of the parties on the matters beyond those set forth in the stock purchase agreement survive indefinitely 
covenant breaches and other indemnification events in the stock purchase agreement are not subject to a deductible basket or a cap 
clarke american is one of the three largest providers of checks and check related products and services in the united states based on revenues  and clarke american is a leading provider of direct marketing services to financial institutions 
clarke american serves financial institutions through the clarke american and alcott routon brands and consumers and businesses directly through the checks in the mail and b direct brands 
clarke american has an industry leading reputation for quality and has won several third party and customer awards 
clarke american s two business segments are the financial institution division of its revenues for full fiscal year and the direct to consumer division of its revenues for full fiscal year 
customers ordering through the financial institution division order checks from clarke american s financial institution clients  and clarke american manages that check order process on their behalf 
the direct to consumer division serves customers who prefer to order checks directly from a check provider 
the reorganization on october   the company completed an internal reorganization the reorganization with certain of its subsidiaries to separate the assets and liabilities related to its licorice products business from the assets and liabilities not related to its licorice products business 
prior to the reorganization  pneumo abex corporation held all the assets and liabilities associated with the licorice products business  as well as other assets and liabilities unrelated to the licorice products business 
in connection with the reorganization  mafco worldwide was formed  and pneumo abex corporation transferred all of the assets and liabilities related to that licorice products business to mafco worldwide 
following the transfer of the licorice products business to mafco worldwide  pneumo abex corporation merged with pneumo abex llc  a newly formed  wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
mafco worldwide then transferred all of the membership interests in pneumo abex llc to another subsidiary of the company  which resulted in pneumo abex llc no longer being a subsidiary of mafco worldwide 
the reorganization had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
economic and other factors affecting the businesses of the company mafco worldwide developments and trends within the tobacco industry may have a material effect on the operations of mafco worldwide 
us cigarette consumption declined an estimated during and approximately to annually over the previous ten years due to significant price increases introduced by the cigarette manufacturers in part to recover costs related to the master settlement agreement with the state attorneys general  as well as greater awareness of health risks by consumers  continuing restrictions on smoking areas and sales tax increases on cigarettes 
sales of american blend cigarettes also declined in western europe during due to increased regulation  smoking restrictions and tax increases 
the rate of sales decline during far exceeded the average rate of decline experienced by this region over the past several years 
consumption of chewing tobacco and moist snuff is concentrated primarily in the us domestic consumption of chewing tobacco products has declined for more than a decade by approximately per year 
chewing tobacco appeals to a limited and declining customer base  primarily males living in rural areas 
moist snuff consumption has risen steadily since the mid s due at least in part to the shift away from cigarettes and other types of smoking tobacco 
consumption of moist snuff has increased approximately to per year over the past ten years 
producers of tobacco products are subject to regulation in the us at the federal  state and local levels  as well as in foreign countries 
together with changing public attitudes toward tobacco products  a constant expansion of tobacco regulations in the us since the early s has been a major cause for the decline in consumption 
moreover  the trend is toward increasing regulation of the tobacco industry 
restrictive foreign tobacco legislation has been on the rise in recent years as well  including restrictions on where tobacco may be sold and used  warning labels and other graphic packaging images  product constituent limitations and a general increase in taxes 
over the years  there has been substantial litigation between tobacco product manufacturers and individuals  various governmental units and private health care providers regarding increased medical expenditures and losses allegedly caused by use of tobacco products 
in part as a result of settlements in certain of this litigation  the cigarette companies have significantly increased the wholesale price of cigarettes in order to recoup the cost of the settlements 
since  cigarette consumption in the us has decreased due to the higher prices of cigarettes  the increased emphasis on the health effects of cigarettes and the continuing restrictions on smoking areas 
the tobacco industry  including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco  has been subject to federal  state  local and foreign excise taxes for many years 
in recent years  federal  state  local and foreign governments have increased or proposed increases to such taxes as a means of both raising revenue and discouraging the consumption of tobacco products 
mafco worldwide is continuously fortifying its relationships with its customers as well as increasing its development of non tobacco related products in order to help offset declines in demand for tobacco products 
clarke american the largest factor impacting the check industry is the continuing decrease in the number of checks written per household 
clarke american believes the number of checks printed is driven by the number of checks written  the number of new checking accounts opened and reorders reflecting changes in consumers personal situations  such as name or address 
checks written remain the largest form of non cash payment in the us  representing more transactions than credit and debit transactions combined 
according to the federal reserve payments study  the total number of all non cash payments including checks and electronic payments in the us has increased from approximately billion in to approximately billion in according to global concepts  inc  an independent consulting firm hired by the federal reserve to analyze check writing patterns  the number of checks written has declined approximately annually from to  and is forecast to decline by approximately annually from to clarke american has also experienced significant pricing pressure as competitors seek to increase volumes through market share gains 
in the financial institution division  consolidation among financial institutions also contributes to pricing pressures as newly combined financial institutions often seek additional price concessions 
in addition  financial institution consolidation may result in the addition or loss of a client when the consolidation involves financial institutions served by our competitors 
in the direct to consumer division  softening customer response rates to direct mail advertisements have negatively impacted clarke american s volumes 
clarke american is responding to these challenges by seeking to gain market share  grow its long term relationships with financial institutions and expand its direct marketing services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company reviews its accounting policies on a regular basis 
the company makes estimates and judgments as part of its financial reporting that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from the assumed outcomes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates 
inventory the majority of the company s inventories consists of licorice raw materials 
licorice raw materials have an infinite life as long as they are kept dry  therefore the company has not been required to establish an obsolescence reserve for licorice 
a reserve for the value of the products has not been necessary based on the company s lower of cost or market analysis 
the company also ensures that storage facilities where the raw materials are inventoried are properly safeguarded and maintained to preserve its characteristics 
prepaid rebates clarke american has contracts with certain financial institution clients that require prepayment of rebates 
the prepaid rebates are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective contracts as a reduction of sales revenue 
this accounting method conforms with the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force item no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product 
whenever material events or changes occur that impact the related contract  including significant declines in the anticipated profitability  the company evaluates the carrying value of the prepaid rebates to determine if impairment has occurred 
the contracts allow clarke american to recoup  at a minimum  the unamortized prepayments in the event that a contract is terminated early 
the unamortized prepaid rebates balance is included in other assets 
advertising direct response advertising is capitalized and amortized over its expected period of future benefits 
direct response advertising consists primarily of inserts that include order coupons for checks in the mail citm products 
these capitalized costs are amortized up to months following their distribution 
amortization is charged to match the advertising expense with the related revenue streams 
other advertising activities include product catalogs and price sheets  which are expensed when issued to clarke american s financial institution clients for use 
income taxes the company estimates actual current tax liability together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must assess the likelihood that it will recover deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
the balance of the valuation allowance at december   was million 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to calculate the amount of income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
on a regular basis  the amount of taxable income is reviewed by various federal  state and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  the company routinely provides reserves for items that it believes could be challenged by these taxing authorities 
in addition  the company routinely provides valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that it believes may not be realized  eg  capital losses 
long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of property  plant and equipment  amortizable intangible assets and investments in joint ventures whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following

significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
spacer

spacer 
gif 
significant changes in the manner of use of these assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer

spacer 
gif 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  it measures the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired 
goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted cash flow models using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values of the company s reporting units  which include the goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the company s implied fair value requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value 
the company measures impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of product formulations and certain tradenames and trademarks  based on projected discounted cash flows 
the company also reevaluates the useful life of these assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets involve significant estimates made by management in determining the fair value of the company s reporting units and its indefinite lived intangible assets 
there is inherent subjectivity involved in estimated future cash flows 
these estimates are susceptible to change from period to period because management must make assumptions about future cash flows  profitability  terminal values and other items 
changes in estimates could have a material impact in the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods 
intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are evaluated for impairment as discussed above in long lived assets 
contingencies and indemnification agreements the company records the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are contingencies  and the accounting for such events follows sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment by management 
the company uses internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers and tax specialists  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that the company has incurred a loss and the amount or range of the loss 
when evaluating the need for an accrual or a change in an existing accrual  the company considers whether it is reasonably probable to estimate an outcome for the contingency based on its experience  any experience of others facing similar contingencies of which the company is aware and the particulars of the circumstances creating the contingency 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery related to those liabilities  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by indemnification is remote 
see item business the tobacco industry and non operating contingent liability  indemnification and insurance matters  item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
pensions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans  which cover certain current and former employees of the company who meet eligibility requirements 
the company s actuarial consultants use several statistical and other factors that attempt to estimate future events to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant difference with the amount of pension expense liability that the company recorded 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any or participate in any off balance sheet arrangements 
consolidated operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  on december  the company acquired clarke american 
accordingly the results of clarke american are included in the company s results of operations from that date 
since december   the company has operated in three business segments a the licorice products segment  through which mafco worldwide produces a variety of licorice products from licorice root  intermediary licorice extracts produced by others and certain other ingredients  which products are sold primarily to the worldwide tobacco industry for use as tobacco flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of american blend cigarettes  moist snuff  chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco  b the financial institution segment  through which clarke american provides checks  check related products and services and direct marketing services to financial institutions and to the account holders of such financial institutions  and c the direct to consumer segment  through which clarke american provides checks  check related products and services and treasury management supplies directly to consumers and businesses

cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the licorice products segment was in the period as compared to in the period 
cost of revenues for the financial institution and direct to consumer segments included in the period were million and million  respectively 
the cost of revenues for clarke american s segments includes a non recurring charge of million related to amortizing a fair value adjustment of million to inventories in connection with the acquisition  the balance of which the company expects to charge to cost of revenues in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses were million in the period and million in the period  an increase of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses from the licorice products segment were million in and million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in the licorice products segment was due primarily to lower professional fees in the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the financial institution and direct to consumer segments included in the period were million and million  respectively 
non segment expenses decreased to million in  from million in due to lower professional fees in interest income was million in the period and million in the period 
the increase was due mainly to higher interest rates and increased cash balances available for investment in cash equivalents and marketable securities in the period

liquidity assessment m f worldwide is a holding company whose only material assets are the stock of its subsidiaries and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  accordingly  m f worldwide conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries  mafco worldwide and clarke american 
m f worldwide s ability to pay its expenses and dividends on its common stock depends on the balance of its own cash and cash equivalents and the payment of dividends to it by mafco worldwide and clarke american 
payments to m f worldwide by those subsidiaries  in turn  depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows and whether they meet the criteria to make dividend payments under the instruments governing their indebtedness 
see risk factors m f worldwide s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay its expenses and dividends on its common stock 
because mafco worldwide and clarke american each have separate debt facilities  m f worldwide evaluates each company s liquidity and capital resources separately 
in addition  m f worldwide is considering various alternatives for the application of its cash and cash equivalents 
mafco worldwide in addition to mafco worldwide s normal operating cash and working capital requirements and service of its indebtedness  it also requires cash to fund capital expenditures  periodically build raw materials inventories and fund administrative and other expenses regarding indemnified liabilities 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
while expenditures for future years are expected to be within this general range  future changes in governmental regulations could require the company to substantially increase capital expenditures in order to comply with these regulations 
inventories 
mafco worldwide s licorice raw materials are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
additionally  most of the licorice root mafco worldwide purchases originates in countries and regions that have  from time to time  been subject to political instability 
accordingly  mafco worldwide must periodically build its raw materials supply in order avoid material shortages or significant raw material price increases 
shortages of licorice raw materials could have a material adverse effect on mafco worldwide s business  results of operations and financial condition 
mafco worldwide believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  will be adequate to make required payments on its indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
clarke american in addition to clarke american s normal operating cash and working capital requirements and service of its indebtedness  it also requires cash to fund capital expenditures  enable cost reductions through restructuring projects and make contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients 
capital expenditures 
clarke american s total capital expenditures which includes capitalized leases of million for the full fiscal year were million 
these expenditures primarily related to maintenance of existing assets  cost reduction initiatives and other projects which support future revenue growth 
prepaid rebates 
during the full fiscal year  clarke american made approximately million of contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients 
clarke american believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  will be adequate to make required payments on its indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and to satisfy its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
cash flow risks each of clarke american s and mafco worldwide s ability to meet their respective debt service obligations and reduce their total debt will depend upon their respective ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond each s respective control 
each of clarke american and mafco worldwide may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to it under its credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its debt or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay each s respective obligations as they mature or to fund its liquidity needs  clarke american or mafco worldwide  as the case may be  may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity 
mafco worldwide or clarke american  as the case may be  may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of their respective existing and future indebtedness may limit their ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
risks that could adversely affect clarke american s ability to meet its debt service obligations include  but are not limited to  decreases in check usage  increases in competitive activity and pricing pressures  additional adverse legislative changes  or adverse changes among clarke american s highly concentrated clients 
in  clarke american s top clients accounted for approximately of clarke american s full fiscal year net revenues 
if bank of america  which is clarke american s largest customer  were to terminate its contract with clarke american  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of clarke american and the company  which would also create severe liquidity problems for clarke american and the company 
in addition  the maturity of the principal industry in which clarke american operates and trends in the paper check industry  including a faster than anticipated decline in check usage due to increasing use of alternative payment methods and other factors  could materially and adversely affect clarke american s and the company s liquidity position 
mafco worldwide may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice root raw material 
mafco worldwide tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for three years 
at december   mafco worldwide had on hand a supply of licorice root raw material approaching three years 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although mafco worldwide has been able to obtain licorice root raw materials without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root raw materials are obtained  mafco worldwide may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root raw materials due to these or other instabilities 
if mafco worldwide is unable to obtain licorice root raw materials  or is unable to obtain them in a cost effective manner  mafco worldwide s business will be severely hampered and mafco worldwide will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
in  mafco worldwide s ten largest customers  eight of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues and of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
one customer  altria group inc  accounted for approximately of mafco worldwide s net revenues 
if altria group inc were to stop purchasing licorice from mafco worldwide  it would have a material adverse effect on the financial results of mafco worldwide and the company  which would also create severe liquidity problems for mafco worldwide and the company

as of december   the company incurred or expected to incur approximately  of unindemnified costs  as to which it either has received or expects to receive approximately  in insurance reimbursements for matters pending or settled through december  management does not expect these unindemnified matters to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  but the company is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that the subsidiary of mcg will indemnify pneumo abex with respect to all environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than the operations relating to pneumo abex s aerospace business  which pneumo abex sold to parker hannifin corporation in april accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to pneumo abex s former aerospace facilities are company s responsibility 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any environmental site due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the aggregate cost of cleanup and related expenses with respect to matters for which pneumo abex  together with numerous other third parties  have been named potentially responsible parties should be substantially less than million 
on february   the company  through pneumo abex  entered into a reimbursement agreement with chemical bank and mcg the reimbursement agreement 
the reimbursement agreement provided for letters of credit covering certain environmental issues relating to a former pneumo abex site 
during  the environmental protection agency reduced the letter of credit requirements to million 
during  the original indemnitor assumed this obligation and mafco worldwide was released from these letters of credit 
the company has not recognized a liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements from the original indemnitor or the indemnity guarantor 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remote 
pneumo abex s former aerospace business sold certain of its aerospace products to the us government or to private contractors for the us government 
pneumo abex retained in the aerospace sale certain claims for allegedly defective pricing that the us government made with respect to certain of these products 
in the remaining unindemnified matter  pneumo abex contests the government s allegations and has been attempting to resolve the matter without litigation 
in addition  various other legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against the company  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  environmental  safety and health matters and other matters 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
in the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

you should read carefully the factors described in the section entitled risk factors of this annual report on form k for a description of certain risks that could  among other things  cause actual results to differ from these forward looking statements 
the company assumes no responsibility to update the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
as of december  and  the company s net foreign currency market exposures of million and million  respectively  are primarily the euro 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as the us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
since the exposures are not material  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would result in a million increase to the related net unrealized gain for december  and a million increase for december  conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would result in a million decrease to the related net unrealized gain for december  and december  at december   mafco worldwide had million of term loans outstanding under the mafco worldwide credit agreement and million outstanding under the mafco worldwide revolving credit facility  including letters of credit 
at december   clarke american had million of term loans outstanding under the clarke american credit agreement and million outstanding under the clarke american revolving credit facility  including letters of credit 
all of these outstanding loans are either abr loans or may be converted into eurodollar loans but in either case  bear interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company is subject to risk due to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to its floating rate debt outstanding as of december  would result in an increase or decrease in its annual interest expense of approximately million per year 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries had any interest rate derivative agreements in effect at december  during february  mafco worldwide and clarke american each entered into interest rate derivative transactions 
mafco worldwide entered into a two year interest rate collar with a notional amount of million 
clarke american entered into a three year interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
the purpose of these derivative transactions was to limit the respective company s risk on a portion of the variable rate senior secured credit facilities and each transaction will be accounted for as a cash flow hedge
