financial condition general 
assets at june  totaled billion compared with billion at june   an increase of million or 
the majority of the asset growth was due to the acquisition of northern on june  that acquisition added million in assets or of the growth 
the remaining asset growth of million or resulted from internal growth 
the following table indicates what part of the change in asset and liability categories was due to the acquisition and what part was due to internal growth 
fair value adjustments and purchase accounting entries that have been pushed down to northern are included in the northern acquisition column 
analysis of change in assets and liability categories june  northern acquisition other internal activity june  assets cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits in other banks securities available for sale loans held for sale loans mortgage and construction commercial consumer total allowance for loan losses net loans federal home loan bank stock premises and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets other assets total assets june  northern acquisition other internal activity june  liabilities deposits noninterest bearing checking interest bearing checking savings and money market certificates of deposit total deposits securities sold under agreement to repurchase borrowings junior subordinated debentures other liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity internal asset growth was driven by loan growth during the fiscal year 
this growth was funded by borrowings and junior subordinated debentures along with deposit growth and a decrease in securities 
we anticipate that future growth will come from a combination of increasing market share in existing markets  the addition of new retail branches  the conversion of loan production offices to business financial centers and acquisitions 
growth by acquisition will be subject to the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition partners 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale increased million or during fiscal that increase included million acquired with northern and a net reduction of million due to other activity 
the million was composed of sales of million  maturities of million and purchases of million 
the excess of sales and maturities over purchases represented a shift of assets from securities to loans 
loans generally carry higher yields than securities and this change in the asset mix to include relatively more loans and less securities had a positive effect on the earning asset yield and net interest income 
further significant reductions in securities are not likely as the company strives to maintain a reasonable level of securities to provide adequate liquidity and in order to have securities available to pledge to secure public funds and other types of transactions 
fluctuations in the market value of securities held by the company relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and management believes  at this time  that all impairment in the securities portfolio is temporary 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale totaled million at june   an increase of million or from million at june  the increase was composed of million of loans acquired with northern and a reduction of million over the course of the fiscal year 
the company was able to reduce its investment in loans held for sale during the year by reducing the time period between when a loan closes and when a loan is sold 
because the majority of the balance of loans held for sale at june  represented loans acquired with northern  management anticipates that the majority of these loans will be sold by september   and that the balance of loans held for sale during the last three quarters of fiscal will be significantly lower than the level at june  loans 
total loans increased million or to billion at june   from billion at june  this increase was composed of million of loans acquired with northern and a net increase of in loans retained in the portfolio 
the internal growth of million represented growth of 
loan growth due to the northern acquisition by loan type was million in mortgage and construction  million in commercial loans and million in consumer loans 
the remainder of the growth during the year and the related annual rates of growth were million or mortgage and construction loans  million or commercial loans and million or in consumer loans 
at june  the portfolio was mortgage and construction loans  commercial loans and consumer loans compared with mortgage and construction loans  commercial loans and consumer loans as of june  the increase in the percentage of mortgage and construction loans relative to commercial loans was due primarily to the northern acquisition 
management anticipates that internal growth during fiscal will result in an increase in commercial loans relative to mortgage and construction loans  resulting in greater diversity in the loan portfolio 
the company engages in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver loan products to customers 
as a result  the company sells most fixed rate residential loans and some adjustable rate residential loans 
during fiscal  the company originated billion in one to four family residential loans and sold billion compared to originations of billion and sales of billion in fiscal the company was able to maintain mortgage banking activity during fiscal at a similar level to fiscal despite significantly higher interest rates during fiscal compared with fiscal through the addition of a small number of highly effective commissioned mortgage loan officers 
nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets consist of loans past due greater than days  nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and repossessed assets 
there were no loans at june  or at june  past due greater than days and still accruing interest 
nonperforming assets totaled million or of total assets at june   compared with million or of total assets at june  at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans and million in repossessed assets 
at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans  and million of repossessed assets 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the performance of the loan portfolio considering economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on real estate values  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and trends in past due and nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio and the general economy 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that management believes warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate loan loss allowance 
in addition to the analysis and procedures just described  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent review of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the company uses the results of this review to help determine the effectiveness of the existing policies and procedures  and to provide an independent assessment of the allowance for loan losses allocated to these types of loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million at june   up million from million at june  first place bank activity accounted for million of the increase and northern accounted for the remaining million 
at the time of the merger northern had an existing allowance for loan losses of million 
immediately following the merger northern recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
this provision was recorded to reflect a change in the approach to managing credit issues at northern and to conform to the company s credit policies 
the primary change in the approach to problem assets is to resolve credit issues more rapidly 
this tends to result in larger initial losses but a decrease in the time an asset remains classified as nonperforming 
after recording this provision  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at northern at june   and at first place bank as of the same date 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans for the company was at june  compared with at june  the decrease in this ratio is consistent with the relatively low level of nonperforming loans and charge offs that northern has experienced over the past several years 
it is also consistent with the shift in the composition of the loan portfolio discussed above 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was at june   up slightly from at june  deposits 
total deposits were billion at june   an increase of million  compared with billion at june  the increase was composed of million acquired with northern  an million decrease in brokered deposits and million in retail deposit growth 
retail deposits grew during the fiscal year 
the largest deposit category was certificates of deposit  which represented of deposits at june  compared with as of june  the net change in certificates of deposit during the fiscal year was composed of million acquired with northern  a million decrease in brokered deposits and a million increase in retail certificates of deposit 
retail certificates of deposit grew during the fiscal year 
at june   the company had million in brokered deposits with original maturities ranging from nine to forty two months 
the company considers brokered deposits to be an element of a diversified funding strategy and an alternative to borrowings 
management regularly compares rates to determine the most economical source of funding 
the company anticipates that they will continue to consider brokered funds as a funding alternative in the future  but not as the primary source of funding to support growth 
borrowings 
borrowings increased million to million at june   compared with million at june  the growth in borrowings included million acquired with northern  a net increase of million in long term borrowings and a net increase of million in short term borrowings 
the company uses borrowings as part of its liquidity management  cash flow  and asset liability management and considers borrowings to be part of a diversified funding strategy 
borrowings are an alternative to raising cash through deposit growth and are used when they offer a favorable alternative to deposits in terms of rate  maturity or volume 
junior subordinated debentures 
these debt instruments increased million to million at june   compared with million at june  this was the result of a new issue of million of debentures issued in september these securities were issued to provide additional liquidity to first place financial corp  the holding company 
in june  a portion of these funds were used to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of northern 
capital resources 
total shareholders equity increased million to million at june   compared with million at june  this increase was primarily composed of million in stock issued as a part of the purchase price of northern  million in comprehensive income reduced by million of cash dividends and million for stock issued in connection with employee and director benefit plans 
the company s board of directors authorized stock repurchase programs in march and march for the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock over a month period in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares at an average price of 
during fiscal no shares were repurchased and as a result all  shares authorized remain available to be purchased at june  the current authorization to purchase treasury stock expires in march stock repurchase programs are a component of the company s strategy to invest excess capital after consideration of market and economic factors  the effect on shareholder dilution  adequacy of capital  effect on liquidity and an assessment of alternative investment returns 
shares repurchased by the company may be used to meet the company s requirements for common shares under its dividend reinvestment plan  stock option or other stock based plans and for general corporate purposes such as expansion and acquisitions or future capital requirements 
office of thrift supervision ots regulations require savings institutions to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
additionally  the regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
generally  an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a core tier capital ratio of at least based on adjusted total assets  a core tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at june   the bank s and northern s capital levels were above the levels required to be well capitalized 
see the liquidity section of this report for a discussion of dividends as a source of funding for the holding company and dividend restrictions imposed on the bank by the ots 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations 
the company uses a variety of funding sources to finance its earning assets and other activities 
these contractual obligations have various terms and maturities that may require the outlay of cash in the future 
the company also enters into contracts such as lease obligations or purchase obligations that commit the company to make future payments for the acquisition of goods or services needed for the normal conduct of its business 
the following table summarizes those obligations as of june  by type and by payment date 
the amounts represent the amounts contractually due and do not include any interest  premiums  discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments 
additional information on the terms of these obligations can be found in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
dollars are in thousands 
financial statement footnote reference less than one year one to three years over three to five years over five years total funding obligations deposits without a stated maturity certificates of deposit securities sold under agreement to repurchase borrowings junior subordinated debentures total funding obligations other obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total other obligation total contractual obligations purchase obligations listed above include commitments to purchase premises and equipment including computer hardware  computer software and retail office facilities and equipment along with long term commitments for licences and maintenance agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into arrangements that are not included in the statements of financial position 
they include commitments to make loans  commitments to sell loans  guarantees under letters of credit  interests in securities or derivatives used to hedge the value of loans held for sale and the use of wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entities that act as trusts to facilitate the sale of debt securities to the public 
as a lending institution  the company makes commitments to lend money before loans are disbursed in order to serve the needs of borrowers 
at june   the company had commitments to make loans totaling million and these loan commitments are similar in form and terms to loans already recorded on the books 
they are underwritten using the same policies and criteria the company uses to underwrite loans 
therefore  these commitments do not present credit risks that are different from the credit risks in the existing loan portfolio 
the company does have interest rate risk on loan commitments and loans held for sale between the time a rate commitment is made to the borrower and the time the company contracts for the sale of the loan 
this risk is minimized by issuing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities to offset this interest rate risk 
at june   the company had million in mortgage loan commitments that are in the form of obligations to sell mortgage backed securities of like maturity and coupon to the loan commitments 
in addition  at june  the company had a funding obligation represented by million in unused lines and letters of credit and million in construction loan funds approved that the borrower has not yet requested be advanced 
the company issues standby letters of credit for commercial customers to third parties to guarantee the performance of customers to those third parties 
if the customer fails to perform  the company performs in its place and treats the funds advanced as an interest bearing loan 
these letters of credit are underwritten using the same policies and criteria as commercial loans 
therefore  these standby letters of credit represent the same risk to the company as a loan to that commercial loan customer would 
at june   the company had million in standby letters of credit outstanding with an average remaining term of months 
while no liability has been recorded for the nominal amount of this obligation  the fair value of this obligation has been recorded in the form of unearned fees 
in december  the company formed two affiliated trusts that issued million of guaranteed capital trust securities 
in september the company formed an additional affiliated trust that issued an additional million of guaranteed capital trust certificates 
these affiliates used the equity capital from the company and the proceeds of the guaranteed capital trust securities to purchase junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures from the company 
the affiliates have no other operations 
based on the structure  nature and purpose of these affiliated trusts  the company has accounted for them using the equity method  and therefore they have not been included in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has guaranteed the securities issued by the affiliated trusts  however  this guarantee is recorded as a liability of the company in the form of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
for additional information on contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements  see the discussion of commitments  contingencies and guarantees in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
the company recorded net income for the year ended june   of million  an increase of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june   were  an increase of compared to for the year ended june  the increases in net income and diluted earnings per share were due primarily to increases in earning assets and improvements in earnings related to loan servicing 
the current year was negatively impacted by merger costs and the prior year was negatively impacted by other than temporary impairment of securities 
the northern savings loan company was acquired on june   and was accounted for using the purchase method 
since it was only included in the consolidated earnings of the company for three days during the fiscal year it did not have any significant impact on net income in the current fiscal year 
for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rates over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories 
the chart below indicates the quarterly change in long term and short term interest rates represented by changes in the us year treasury bond rate  the target federal funds rate and the difference between the two rates which is an indicator of the steepness of the interest rate curve 
date us year treasury bond rate target federal funds rate difference while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have risen basis points over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  rose dramatically faster increasing basis points during the same period 
as a result  the yield curve  which had a significant positive slope at june   became progressively flatter during fiscal and fiscal and ended up slightly inverted at june  net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statement of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june   totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans supplemented by an increase in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the yield on loans increased as loans originated in prior years were paid off and were replaced by loans with higher current market rates 
interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june   compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on securities was due to a million decrease in the average balance of securities  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield 
interest expense for the year ended june   was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased by million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  primarily due to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june   compared with billion for the year ended june  the average cost of deposits increased basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that increase was due to the dramatic increase in short term interest rates which impacted both the cost of certificates of deposit and nonmaturity deposit accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million to million from million for the prior year almost entirely due to increases in short term interest rates during fiscal interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   up from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average cost of long term borrowings 
the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decline in the interest rate swap amortization accounted for basis points of the basis point decline in the cost of long term borrowings 
scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
additional information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june   totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was driven by loan growth 
both asset yields and liability costs increased during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at higher interest rates 
the net result was a basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal both spread and net interest margin decreased due to the flattening of the yield curve during fiscal as the yield curve becomes flatter there is less opportunity to increase net interest income by taking on interest rate risk as the differential between short term and long term interest rates decreases 
average balances  interest rates and yields 
the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of fully taxable equivalent interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed in both dollars and rates

the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase or decrease related to changes in balances and or changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which was an increase of million from million for fiscal the provision for loan losses for fiscal was composed of million related to first place bank loans and million recorded for northern loans after the merger was completed 
the million provision was recorded to reflect a change in the approach to managing credit issues at northern and to conform to the company s credit policies 
the primary change in the approach to problem assets is to resolve credit issues more rapidly 
this tends to result in larger initial losses but a decrease in the time an asset remains as nonperforming 
net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal nonperforming loans increased million or to million at june   compared with million at june  the increase in the provision for loan losses in fiscal compared with fiscal was consistent with the increases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans declined to at june   from a year earlier 
this decline was primarily due to the addition of the northern loans which were primarily one to four family loans and which historically had low levels of charge offs 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year ended june  the increase was due primarily to a significant increase in income related to loan servicing in the current year and a charge for other than temporary impairment of securities in the prior year 
loan servicing income was million for fiscal compared with  for fiscal loan servicing income is sensitive to changes in interest rates and can change dramatically from year to year as it has in the current fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
interest rates were at extremely low levels three years ago on june   with many rates at or near the lowest level they had been in years 
during the past three years  both short term and long term interest rates have varied significantly and have not moved in tandem resulting in significant shifts in the shape and slope of the yield curve 
the level and variability in interest rates over that period has resulted in significant variations in loan servicing income  including changes in the level of impairment of msrs 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs has impacted loan servicing income over the past two years 
year ended june  loan servicing income loss loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss the increase in loan servicing revenue net of amortization in the current year compared to the prior year was due to a slowdown in amortization of servicing rights due to loan payoffs 
the change in impairment was due to long term interest rates being significantly higher at june   than they were at june  the remaining allowance for impairment of msrs at june  was million 
over the past several years  the volume and dollar value of loan servicing rights has been growing more rapidly than total assets on a percentage basis 
as a result  the company s exposure to volatility in mortgage banking revenue has also increased 
in order to reduce exposure to volatility due to rapid payoffs or impairment  the company sold msrs with a cost basis of million or approximately of its loan servicing rights during march this resulted in a gain of million contrasted with no gain in the prior year 
historically the company has sold loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
however  this was the company s first sale of servicing rights 
management plans to consider additional sales of msrs in the future depending on size of the servicing asset relative to total assets and based on the current market for the sale of msrs 
net losses on sale of securities were million for fiscal contrasted with a gain of million for fiscal management made a strategic decision to sell million of low yielding securities in march at a loss in order to reinvest to take advantage of yields in the current market that were higher than they had been for the previous two years 
securities may be sold to generate changes in liquidity  interest rate risk or maximize total returns on securities or minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains or losses on the sale of securities are currently or will be a significant component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
no impairment of securities was recorded during fiscal compared with a charge of million during fiscal in december  the company recorded a million pretax charge for other than temporary impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
when the market value of a security remains significantly below amortized cost impairment for an extended period of time  generally accepted accounting principles require a company to make a determination whether that impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
all of the securities currently on the books of the company are classified as available for sale 
therefore  all securities are recorded in the statement of condition at market value 
this is accomplished by a credit or charge to other comprehensive income  and those market value changes are not reflected in the income statement 
if securities are impaired and the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by reversing the existing charge to other comprehensive income and recording a charge to the income statement 
the freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks owned by the company had been impaired for approximately three years 
our research into the reasons for the impairment revealed the following information about relevant events between september  and december  in december  the securities and exchange commission recommended that fannie mae restate their financial statements to comply with statements of financial accounting standards nos 
and  in december  the office of federal housing enterprise oversight indicated that fannie mae was significantly undercapitalized as of september  as a result of accounting mistakes  fannie mae had accepted the retirement of its ceo  the resignation of its cfo and had changed auditors all between december  and december   between september  and december   the impaired securities declined million value in market value  which represented a decline in value even though the rates the securities are indexed to went up  and in december  senators sununu  hagel and dole called for changes in the regulatory oversight of fannie mae and freddie mac based on fannie mae s recent problems with their financial statements and based on freddie mac s financial reporting problems in based on this and other information the company chose to take a conservative position in projecting the timing of recovery of impairment 
therefore  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to record a write down to recognize other than temporary impairment on all freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks in the company s securities portfolio that were impaired as of december  these stocks had a cost basis of million and were written down to their market value at december  of million 
this write down did not have any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been recorded at market value as available for sale securities 
net gains on the sale of loans were stable between years  remaining at million for fiscal and fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on million in sales compared with basis points on million of loan sales in fiscal the level of loan originations  sales and gains on the sale of loans are all results that tend to vary inversely with interest rates 
loan activity tends to increase as interest rates decrease and loan activity tends to decrease as interest rates increase 
in spite of rising interest rates during fiscal  the company was able to maintain mortgage banking activity levels by selectively adding experienced  successful loan officers and by concentrating on servicing customers purchasing homes over customers seeking refinances of their existing homes 
management anticipates increased variability in mortgage banking in future periods 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal other income bank increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal primarily due to a million gain from recognizing an equity interest in a credit card servicer resulting from a conversion to the stock form of ownership 
other income nonbank subsidiaries increased or million to million primarily due to an increase in the level of commissions earned from insurance  real estate and wealth management affiliates 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the most prominent reason for the increase was million in expenses for merger  integration and restructuring related to the northern acquisition 
there were no expenses of this type in fiscal salaries and employee benefits increased or million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase was due to additions and replacement of executive and other nonretail personnel along with increases to stock based retirement and incentive plans 
loan expenses increased million or to million due to increased loan production  primarily in the commercial loan area 
marketing expense decreased million or due to a conscious effort by management to control expenses in this area and concentrate on only the most effective delivery methods 
franchise tax expense increased million or to million 
the company anticipates that the franchise tax will be at or below the levels experienced in fiscal from july through december amortization of intangible assets decreased million or due to a decline in the amortization of the core deposit intangible asset from the franklin acquisition in may amortization of intangibles will increase significantly beginning in july due to the northern acquisition 
other noninterest expenses increased million or to million for the current fiscal year compared to the prior year 
this increase was due to increases in atm  real estate owned and other expenses related to growth in the balance sheet and business volumes 
provision for income taxes 
income tax for the current fiscal year was million  an increase of million from the prior year expense of million 
the increase in the income tax expense was due to the increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the million receipt of life insurance proceeds in the prior year which was not subject to income tax 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
the company recorded net income for the year ended june  of million  an increase of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june  were  an increase of compared to for the year ended june  the increases in net income and diluted earnings per share were due primarily to increased assets and earnings related to the may  acquisition of franklin bancorp  inc for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rate over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories 
the chart below indicates the quarterly change in long term and short term interest rates represented by changes in the us year treasury bond rate and the target federal funds rate 
date us year treasury bond rate target federal funds rate while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have fluctuated primarily between and over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  were stable during fiscal and rose steadily during fiscal  increasing basis points over the course of the year 
as a result the yield curve  which was relatively stable during fiscal  became progressively flatter throughout fiscal net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statement of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june  totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans partially offset by a reduction in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in average loan balances was primarily due to including a full year of the loans of the franklin division of first place bank in fiscal compared to one month in fiscal the yield on loans declined as we continued to experience the payoff of older high rate mortgage loans 
that decline was partially offset by increases in the yields on commercial and consumer loans due to increases on the prime lending rate during fiscal interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in interest income on mortgage backed and other securities was due to a basis point increase in the average rate  partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance 
interest expense for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased by million to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  primarily due to the increase in average balances net of a small benefit from a decrease in the average cost of deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june  compared to  million for the year ended june  the increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to including a full year of the deposits of the franklin division of first place bank in fiscal compared to one month in fiscal the average cost of deposits declined basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that decline was due to the maturity of older high rate certificates of deposit partially offset by increases in the cost of checking  savings and money market accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million to million from million for the prior year primarily due to increases in short term interest rates during fiscal and to a lesser extent due to increases in the average balance of short term borrowings 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average cost of long term borrowings 
the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decline in the interest rate swap amortization accounted for basis points of the basis point decline in the cost of long term borrowings 
scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
additional information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was primarily due to the addition of assets from the franklin acquisition 
both asset yields and liability costs declined slightly during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the net result was a basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal the increase in the margin was primarily due to the increase in noninterest bearing checking accounts of million to an average balance of for fiscal compared with for fiscal which was also primarily due to the franklin acquisition 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which was a decrease of million from million for fiscal net charge offs declined million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans decreased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal taken together the provision and net charge offs for fiscal resulted in an increase of million or in the allowance for loan losses to million at june  compared with million at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans declined to at june  from a year earlier 
this was consistent with the change in nonperforming loans which increased on an absolute basis  but declined as a percent of loans 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased to million in the year ended june  from million for the prior year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a charge for other than temporary impairment of securities and a decline in the gain on the sale of loans partially offset by increases in service charges and other income generated by the bank 
in december the company recorded a million pretax charge for other than temporary impairment of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
when the market value of a security remains significantly below amortized cost impairment for an extended period of time  generally accepted accounting principles require a company to make a determination whether that impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
all of the securities currently on the books of the company are classified as available for sale 
therefore  all securities are recorded in the statement of condition at market value 
this is accomplished by a credit or charge to other comprehensive income  and those market value changes are not reflected in the income statement 
if securities are impaired and the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by reversing the existing charge to other comprehensive income and recording a charge to the income statement 
the freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks owned by the company had been impaired for approximately three years 
in order to determine the nature of that impairment the following factors were considered the likelihood that changes in interest rates would result in a recovery of impairment  the company s expectation for the direction and the magnitude of changes in interest rates  the level of confidence associated with the company s expectation of future interest rates  current ratings of fannie mae and freddie mac securities outstanding  alternative competing investments current available in the market  public knowledge about current operations at freddie mac and fannie mae  the political climate in which these agencies operate  and the length of time these securities have already been impaired 
our investigation of these issues revealed the following information about relevant events between september  and december  in december the securities and exchange commission recommended that fannie mae restate their financial statements to comply with statements of financial accounting standards nos 
and  in december the office of federal housing enterprise oversight indicated that fannie mae was significantly undercapitalized as of september  as a result of accounting mistakes  fannie mae had accepted the retirement of its ceo  the resignation of its cfo and had changed auditors all between december  and december   between september  and december   the impaired securities declined million value in market value  which represented a decline in value even though the rates the securities are indexed to went up  and in december senators sununu  hagel and dole called for changes in the regulatory oversight of fannie mae and freddie mac based on fannie mae s recent problems with their financial statements and based on freddie mac s financial reporting problems in based on this and other information the company chose to take a conservative position in projecting the timing of recovery of impairment 
therefore  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million to record a write down to recognize other than temporary impairment on all freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stocks in the company s securities portfolio that were impaired as of december  these stocks had a cost basis of million and were written down to their market value at december  of million 
this write down did not have any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been recorded at market value as available for sale securities 
noninterest income also declined due to a decline in the net gains on sale of loans 
net gains on the sale of loans were million in fiscal  a decrease of from million in fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on million in sales compared with basis points on million of loan sales in fiscal the most significant difference between fiscal and was that the first quarter of fiscal was a very favorable market to originate and sell residential mortgage loans 
interest rates were at year lows and refinance activity was at record high levels 
during that quarter  the company realized gains on the sale of loans of million on sales of million of loans or an average of basis points 
during the remaining nine months of fiscal  the company realized gains of million on sales of million or an average gain of basis points 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal this increase was due to increases in checking account and atm fees that grew primarily due to the increase in checking accounts from the franklin acquisition 
other income bank increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal a portion of the increase was a payment of million  which represented the tax free proceeds of a life insurance policy on a former company executive 
the remainder was related to new banking services or an expansion in the level of existing services primarily due to the franklin acquisition 
loan servicing income was  for fiscal which represented a  increase over fiscal while these amounts were not significant when compared to net income in fiscal or fiscal the loan servicing operation is significant because it is sensitive to changes in interest rates and has the potential to have a significant impact on net income in fiscal and future years 
loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
historically low interest rates over the past three years and volatility in rates recently have resulted in the increased variability of loan servicing income on a quarterly basis in spite of the lack of change between the current and prior fiscal years 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs impacts loan servicing income 
year ended june  loan servicing income loss loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss the reduction of the loss in loan servicing revenue net of amortization in the current year compared to the prior year was due to a slowdown in amortization of servicing rights due to loan payoffs 
the change in impairment was due to long term interest rates being significantly lower at june  than they were at june  whereas they were significantly higher at june  than they were at june  the remaining allowance for impairment of msrs at june  was million 
net gains on sale of securities were million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal securities may be sold to generate changes in liquidity  interest rate risk or maximize total returns on securities or minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains on the sale of securities are currently or will be a significant component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
the company has undertaken a number of expansion initiatives over the past two years which have resulted in increases in noninterest expense 
these initiatives have also resulted in significant increases in net interest income  service charge income and commercial loan originations 
the most significant initiative was the acquisition of franklin bancorp inc on may  the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
therefore  the operating expenses of franklin are included in the consolidated financial statements beginning with the date of acquisition 
other initiatives during fiscal include expansion of the north olmsted  ohio loan production office to a business financial center  and the addition of loan production offices in carmel  indiana and in northville  jackson and holland  michigan 
these initiatives particularly impacted salaries and benefits and occupancy expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared with million for the prior year 
occupancy and equipment expenses were million for the year ended june   an increase of million over expense of million for the prior fiscal year 
professional fees were million for fiscal which was an increase of or million over fiscal the increase was due to additional independent audit costs and consulting costs to comply with sarbanes oxley act section  which relates to management s assessment of internal controls  outsourcing of the internal audit function for the first time in fiscal and from increased legal costs for delinquent loans as the company has grown due to the franklin acquisition 
marketing expense increased million or due to the franklin acquisition and due to increased advertising in ohio to increase market awareness of the first place name 
franchise tax expense decreased million or to million due to the impact of the franklin acquisition 
amortization of intangible assets increased million or due to amortization of the core deposit intangible asset from the franklin acquisition 
merger  integration and restructuring expense related to the franklin acquisition was million in fiscal compared to no expense in the current year 
other noninterest expenses increased million to million for the current fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was also primarily due to the increase in the size of the company as a result of the franklin acquisition and other expansion initiatives 
provision for income taxes 
income tax for the current fiscal year was million  an increase of million from the prior year expense of million 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the income tax expense was due to the increase in pretax income 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the million receipt of life insurance proceeds in the current year which was not subject to income tax 
liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the company to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  the issuance of debt or equity securities and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 
at june   the company had million of cash and unpledged securities available to meet cash needs 
unpledged securities can be sold or pledged to secure additional borrowings 
in addition  the company had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank based on loans currently pledged under blanket pledge agreements 
this compared to million of cash and unpledged securities and federal home loan bank availability of million at june  potential cash available as measured by liquid assets and borrowing capacity has increased during fiscal primarily due to the addition of pledgable assets with the northern acquisition 
in addition to the sources of funds listed above  the company has the ability to raise additional funds by increasing deposit rates relative to competition locally or in national markets  or to sell additional loans 
management believes that the current and potential resources mentioned are adequate to meet liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
first place financial corp  as a holding company  has more limited sources of liquidity 
in addition to its existing liquid assets it can raise funds in the securities markets through debt or equity offerings or it can receive dividends from the bank 
cash can be used by the holding company to make acquisitions  pay the quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures  pay dividends to common shareholders and fund operating expenses 
at june   the holding company had cash and unpledged securities of million available to meet cash needs 
annual debt service on the junior subordinated debentures is approximately million 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company without prior approval of the ots 
generally the bank may pay dividends without prior approval as long as the dividend is not more than the total of the current calendar year to date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends  and as long as the bank would remain well capitalized 
the bank has not paid any dividends to the holding company during fiscal and northern paid a dividend of million to the holding company in june as of june   the bank would be able to pay approximately million and northern would not be able to pay any additional dividend without the approval of the ots 
future dividend payments by the bank beyond the million will be based upon future earnings or the approval of the ots 
impact of inflation consolidated financial data included herein has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
presently  gaap requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or deflation are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the company to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not move concurrently 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in a volatile economic environment 
in an effort to protect itself from the effects of interest rate volatility  the company reviews its interest rate risk position frequently  monitoring its exposure and taking necessary steps to minimize any detrimental effects on the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies the company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
some of these accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain 
application of assumptions different than those used by management could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
these policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
these policies include the policies to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights 
these policies  current assumptions and estimates utilized and the related disclosure of this process are determined by management and reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
details of the policies  the nature of the estimates  and the sensitivity of the estimates follow 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors 
loans are reviewed individually  or in the case of small homogeneous loans  in the aggregate 
this review includes historical data  the ability of the borrower to meet the terms of the loan  an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan  various collection strategies and other factors relevant to the loan or loans 
external factors considered include economic conditions  current interest rates  trends in the borrower s industry and the market for various types of collateral 
in addition  overall information about the loan portfolio or segments of the portfolio is considered  including industry concentrations  delinquency statistics and workout experience based on factors such as historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions 
as a result  determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses involves not only evaluating the current financial situation of individual borrowers or groups of borrowers but also current predictions about future cash flows that could change before an actual loss is determined 
based on the variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 
one of the tools utilized by management to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses is the grading of individual loans according to the severity of credit issue 
an illustration of the sensitivity of this system to changes in conditions or changes in estimates follows 
the most serious grading a loan can receive is to be classified as a loss 
a loan classified in the loss grade would be reserved and would be subject to charge off 
the next most serious grade is identified as doubtful 
at june   the company had million of loans classified as doubtful 
if all of these loans were to deteriorate and become classified as a loss the allowance for loan losses would need to increase by approximately million 
mortgage servicing rights 
when the company sells a mortgage loan and retains the rights to service that loan  the amortized cost of the loan is allocated between the loan sold and the mortgage servicing right retained 
the basis assigned to the mortgage servicing right is amortized in proportion to and over the life of the net revenue anticipated to be received from servicing the loan 
mortgage servicing rights are valued at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
fair value is measured by stratifying the portfolio of loan servicing rights into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
when the amortized cost of a group of loans exceeds the fair value  an allowance for impairment is recorded to reduce the value of the mortgage servicing rights to fair value 
fair value for each group of loans is determined quarterly by obtaining an appraisal from an independent third party 
that appraisal is based on a modeling process in conjunction with information on recent sales of mortgage servicing rights 
some of the assumptions used in the modeling process are prepayment speeds  delinquency rates  servicing costs  periods to hold idle cash  returns currently available on idle cash  and a discount rate  which takes into account the current rate of return anticipated by holders of servicing rights 
the process of determining the fair value of servicing rights involves a number of judgments and estimates including the way loans are grouped  the estimation of the various assumptions used by recent buyers and a projection of how those assumptions may change in the future 
the most important variable in valuing servicing rights is the level of interest rates 
long term interest rates are the primary determinant of prepayment speeds while short term interest rates determine the return available on idle cash 
the process of estimating the value of loan servicing rights is further complicated by the fact that short term and long term interest rates may change in a similar magnitude and direction or may change independent of each other 
the following table indicates how changes in assumptions about the prepayment speeds in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio would affect the fair value of the portfolio  as of the date of the most recent outside quarterly evaluation date  may  fair value of mortgage servicing rights fair value of mortgage servicing rights assuming increase in prepayment speeds increase in prepayment speeds loan prepayment speeds have varied significantly over the past three years and could continue to vary in the future 
in addition  any of the other variables mentioned above could change over time 
therefore  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is  and is expected to continue to be  a critical accounting policy where the results are based on estimates that are subject to change over time and can have a significant financial impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the type of risk that occurs when a company suffers economic loss due to changes in the market value of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  the company makes a profit by accepting and managing various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk 
it is the risk that occurs when changes in market interest rates will result in a reduction in net interest income or net interest margin because interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
asset liability management is the measurement and analysis of the company s exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the objective of the company s asset liability management function is to balance the goal of maximizing net interest income with the control of risks in the areas of liquidity  safety  capital adequacy and earnings volatility 
in general  the company s customers seek loans with long term fixed rates and deposit products with shorter maturities which creates a mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
the company s primary strategy to counteract this mismatch is to sell the majority of long term fixed rate loans within days after they are closed 
the company manages this risk and other aspects of interest rate risk on a continuing basis through a number of functions including review of monthly financial results  rate setting  cash forecasting and planning  budgeting and an asset liability committee 
on a quarterly basis  the asset liability committee reviews the results of an interest rate risk model that forecasts changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv  based on one or more interest rate scenarios 
npv is the market value of financial assets less the market value of financial liabilities 
npv is performed as of a single point in time and does not include estimates of future business volumes 
the model combines detailed information on existing assets and liabilities with an interest rate forecast  loan prepayment speed assumptions and assumptions about how those assets and liabilities will react to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  customer product and term selection  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as differences in how interest rates change at various points along the yield curve 
the results below indicate how npv would change based on various changes in interest rates 
the projections are as of june   and a year earlier and are based on an instantaneous change in interest rates and assume that short term and long term rates change by the same magnitude and in the same direction 
net portfolio value basis point change in rates june  net portfolio value ratio june  net portfolio value ratio base the change in the npv ratio is a long term measure of what might happen to the market value of financial assets and liabilities over time if interest rates changed instantaneously and the company did not change existing strategies 
the actual results could be better or worse based on changes in interest rate risk strategies 
the above results indicate the company is exposed to a decline in npv if rates rise and would realize an increase in npv from falling rates 
in addition the company is in a position to gain more from falling rates and to lose more from rising rates than it was a year earlier 
the results of the projections are within parameters established by the board of directors 
in addition to the risk of changes in net interest income  the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to loans held for sale and loan commitments 
this is the risk that occurs when changes in interest rates will reduce gains or result in losses on the sale of residential mortgage loans that the company has committed to originate but has not yet contracted to sell 
the company hedges this risk by executing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities based on the volume of committed loans that are likely to close 
additionally  msrs act as a hedge against rising rates  as they becomes more valuable in a rising rate environment  offsetting the decline in the value of loan commitments or loans held for sale in a rising rate environment
