table of contents executive summary we are an owner and operator of television stations in mid sized markets in the united states and puerto rico 
our operating revenues are derived from the sale of advertising time to local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from the networks for the broadcast of their programming and from other broadcast related activities 
we recorded a net loss of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  compared to net income of million in the following are some of our operating highlights for compared to we acquired the following television stations in dma rank market call letters network indianapolis  indiana wndy tv upn columbus  ohio wwho tv upn albuquerque  new mexico krqe tv cbs mobile  alabama pensacola  florida wala tv fox wbpg tv wb green bay  wisconsin wluk tv fox terre haute  indiana wthi tv cbs we operate this station through a local marketing agreement and we have a purchase agreement to acquire this station for million subject to fcc regulatory approvals 
we increased our debt by million primarily related to our acquisitions of stations as follows we entered into a new six year credit facility with total borrowings of up to million 
we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due for gross proceeds of million 
we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due class b for gross proceeds of million 
we repurchased or redeemed million principal amount of our senior notes due we invested million in usdtv  a video program subscription service that uses a portion of the local broadcast television spectrum to broadcast a multi channel program service to viewers 
we started a share repurchase program of up to million of our class a common stock and purchased million or  shares as of december  we implemented sfas r on october  and recorded stock based compensation expense of million for year ended december  compared to million in we recorded an impairment of million in the carrying value of goodwill for year ended december  industry trends the broadcast television industry is reliant primarily on advertising revenues and faces increased competition largely from new technologies 
the following summarizes certain of the competitive forces and risks that may impact our future operating results 
for a discussion of other factors that may affect our business  see risk factors 

table of contents on february   the president signed into law a measure requiring the fcc to auction off the remaining analog broadcasting spectrum by january  and requiring all analog broadcast transmissions to cease by february  the measure also provided for a subsidy to provide free digital converters to consumers with analog receivers who depend on over the air service and do not subscribe to cable or satellite service 
networks are basing the negotiation of affiliation agreements renewals or extensions contingent upon a reduction or eventual elimination of network compensation payments and in certain contract extensions are requiring broadcast stations to pay compensation to the network 
in addition  the upn and wb networks announced that they would cease operating as a network and would no longer provide programming after september  we believe that we have three options for these stations i affiliate with the newly created cw television network  ii affiliate with the newly created my network tv or iii operate as an independent station  unaffiliated with any network 
the number of national program services has increased the competition for national advertising dollars resulting in our advertising revenues shifting from national advertisers to local advertisers 
we received of our revenues from local advertisers in compared to in we expect this trend to continue 
we no longer have exclusive rights to off network programs for time periods where we do not air our local news or network programs 
many of these programs now air on national cable channels or can be purchased on dvds or via downloads to computers and mobile video devices by our television audience 
this causes a further fragmentation of our television audience making it more difficult to maintain or increase the rates we charge our advertisers 
political revenues from elections and revenues from olympic games  which generally occur on the even years  continue to create fluctuations in our operating results on a year to year comparison 
according to the television bureau of advertising  i us television advertising decreased in due largely to the loss of political advertising  ii us television advertising increased in due largely to political advertising and the olympic games  and iii us television advertising decreased in due to the impact of the war in iraq and the loss of political revenue 
we depend on automotive related advertising that represented approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant change in these advertising revenues could materially affect our future results of operations 
business transactions we have developed our business through a combination of acquisitions  dispositions and organic growth 
we have acquired the following businesses during emmis station acquisitions on november   we acquired four network affiliated television stations and a local marketing agreement to operate another network affiliated station from emmis communications for million in cash 
the four acquired stations included krqe tv  the cbs affiliate serving albuquerque  new mexico  plus regional satellite stations  wala tv  the fox affiliate serving mobile  alabama pensacola  florida  wluk tv  the fox affiliate serving green bay  wisconsin and wthi tv  the cbs affiliate serving terre haute  indiana 
we have a local marketing agreement to operate wbpg tv  the wb affiliate serving mobile  alabama pensacola  florida and a purchase option for million to acquire the station from emmis upon fcc approval 
viacom station acquisitions on march   we acquired wndy tv  the upn affiliate serving indianapolis  indiana  and wwho tv  the upn affiliate serving columbus  ohio  from viacom  inc for million in cash 

table of contents during and  we acquired  exchanged or disposed of the following businesses and assets type of transaction price acquisition date station business transaction in millions weyi tv disposition million wtin tv acquisition million wirs tv acquisition million krbc tv and kacb tv disposition million mhz spectrum channel in various markets acquisition million in  we began operations of wapa america  a new spanish language programming service for satellite and cable distribution in the united states 
wapa america receives its programming from our station in puerto rico and is distributed by our springfield  massachusetts television hub 
wapa america broadcasts current puerto rican news and entertainment shows as well as classic programming from wapa s prime time library 
also in  we began broadcasting mtv puerto rico on our second station in puerto rico 
this program service is a joint program venture with mtv and targets a younger viewing audience that we believe is under served by other television stations in the puerto rico market 
subsequent developments upn and wb television networks 
on january   the upn and wb networks announced they would cease operating as a network and would no longer provide programming after september  seven of our stations are either upn or wb network affiliates 
these stations currently receive an average of two to three hours of daily programming from these networks and the revenue associated with these network programmed time periods is less than of the our consolidated net revenues 
we believe that we have three options for these stations affiliate with the newly created cw television network  affiliate with the newly created my network tv or operate as an independent station  unaffiliated with any network 
we also believe that the dissolution of the wb and upn networks will not have a material impact on our net revenues or operating income 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  program rights  income taxes  pensions  contingencies  share based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we are required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a 
table of contents comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario that excludes network compensation payments 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing values in the markets for broadcasting properties 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the station s fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill and broadcast licenses as of december   and as a result of these tests no additional impairment was required as of december  and an impairment of million and million was recorded as of december  and  respectively 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our business plans and overall expectations as to market and economic considerations 
approximately billion  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of unamortized intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires  among other things  the impairment testing of goodwill 
if at any point in the future the value of these intangible assets decreased  we could be required to incur an impairment charge that could significantly and adversely impact our reported results of operations and stockholders equity 
our class a common stock currently trades at a price that results in a market capitalization less than total stockholder s equity as of december  and has done so since april if we were required to write down intangible assets in future periods  we would incur an impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and the trading price of our class a common stock 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following basic assumptions for year ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to if we were to decrease the market growth by one percent and by half of the projected growth rate  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  if we were to decrease the operating margins by and of the projected operating margins  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  if we were to increase the discount rate used in our valuation by and  we would incur an impairment of our broadcast licenses of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  
table of contents we based the valuation of goodwill on the following basic assumptions for year ended december market revenue growth to to operating profit margins to to discount rate tax rate to to capitalization rate to to if we were to decrease the market growth by one percent and by half of the projected growth rate  the carrying amount of our stations would exceed their fair value by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  if we were to decrease the operating margins by and of the projected operating margins  the carrying amount of our stations would exceed their fair value by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  if we were to increase the discount rate that it used in our valuation by and  the carrying amount of our stations would exceed their fair value by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in addition  we would be required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill million at december  
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by a notional reperformance of the purchase price allocation using the station s fair value as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
network affiliations different broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of different valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets between broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market 
the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s  generally channels two to thirteen  are viewed more often than newer television stations 
vhf stations  generally channels two to thirteen are typically viewed more often than uhf stations generally channels fourteen to sixty nine because these stations have been broadcasting longer than uhf stations and because of the inferior uhf signal in the early years of uhf stations 
the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city within a tri city market 
the audience acceptance of the broadcast licensee s local news programming and community involvement 
a local television station s news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming 

table of contents the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station s syndication programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the number one station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  fox  nbc  and cbs each have multiple affiliations with local television stations that have the largest prime time audience in the local market in which the station operates 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to assign higher values to our acquired network affiliation agreements and  therefore  less value to our broadcast licenses  it would have a significant impact on our operating results 
the following chart reflects the hypothetical impact of the hypothetical reassignment of value from broadcast licenses to network affiliations and the resulting increase in amortization expense assuming a year amortization period for the year ended december  in thousands percentage of total value reassigned to network affiliation agreements as reported balance sheet as of december  broadcast licenses other intangible assets  net including network affiliation agreements statement of operations for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets operating income loss loss from continuing operations net loss net loss per diluted share we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses acquired and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets it would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to the television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets we operate in beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 
other broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are an important component of the value of a station 
these companies believe that vhf stations are popular because they have been affiliating with networks from the inception of network broadcasts  stations with network affiliations 
table of contents have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
if we were to adopt this alternative method for valuing these network affiliations  the value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill as reported on our balance sheet would be reduced and the value of our other intangibles assets would be proportionately increased 
as a result  our expenses relating to the depreciation and amortization of intangible assets could increase significantly as more value would be assigned to an amortizing asset and this increase could materially reduce our operating income and materially increase our net loss 
in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different attributes of each station and the market in which it operates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed our tax valuation allowance related to federal income taxes which resulted in a million increase in our benefit from income taxes 
we made the determination that it was more than likely that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future based on the positive evidence of our historical performance over the last three years and on our projections of future results of operations 
lower interest rates compared to prior years and increased operating results from our acquisition of the stations acquired from viacom and emmis were key factors in our determination 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcast revenue during the financial statement period in which advertising is aired 
barter revenue is accounted for at the fair value of the assets or services received  or the advertising time surrendered  whichever is more clearly evident 
barter revenue is recorded at the time the advertising is broadcast  and barter expense is recorded at the time the assets or services are used 
we recognized barter revenue in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred barter expense in the amounts of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation on october   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment and its related implementation guidance in accounting for stock based employee compensation arrangements 
this statement requires us to estimate the fair value of stock based awards exchanged for employee services and recognize compensation cost based on this fair value over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock awards using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
and prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings  including stock based compensation as determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock 
table of contents based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the our historical exercise patterns 
price volatility is based on historical volatilities of our common stock and its expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience and of the common stock of peer group companies engaged in the broadcasting business 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and its results of operations could be materially impacted 
the following table presents the stock compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income and recognized in accordance with sfas r for the three month period ended december  and the stock compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income and recognized in accordance with apb for the nine month period ended september  and for the years ended december  and based on the accounting rules under sfas r apb for the for the for year three month nine month for year ended ended period ended period ended december  december  december  september  direct operating selling  general and administrative corporate share based compensation expense before tax income tax benefit net stock based compensation expense during  we evaluated our method of compensating our employees and decreased the number of share option awards compared to prior years and increased the number of restricted stock awards granted to employees 
we expect stock based compensation expense to increase significantly over the next two years and we have not yet recognized compensation expense relating to the unvested employee stock options and stock awards of million in the aggregate that will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years

program rights are analyzed by management on an ongoing basis through a review of ratings  program schedules and revenue projections  among other factors 
if the projected future net revenues are less than the current carrying value of the program rights  we write down the program rights to equal the amount of projected future net revenues 
our total program rights were million and million at december  and  respectively 
retirement plan actuarial assumptions our retirement benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 

two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increase 
we have a number of noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our employees in the united states and puerto rico 
contributions are based on period actuarial valuations and are charged to operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees 
the net pension expense is assessed in accordance 
table of contents with the advice of professionally qualified actuaries 
the benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and compensation 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
our long term return on asset roa and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
to develop the long term roa assumption  we considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which we invested pension plan assets  and the expectations for future returns of each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within our policy allocation ranges to develop the long term roa assumption 
the policy asset allocation ranges are between and equities and between and debt securities 
the long term roa assumption for our pension plans in is  unchanged from and the actual roa was and for and  respectively 
the discount rate assumption was determined by selecting a rate that would reflect the weighted rate on a theoretical high quality bond portfolio that would closely match the various durations of our pension liability duration 
our plan has an average duration consistent with a typical  ongoing pension plan 
accordingly  we look to the moody s aa rate as an appropriate benchmark 
the discount rate assumption for our pension plans in is  compared to the discount rate of and for and  respectively 
our pension expense is expected to be approximately million in for every that the actual pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term roa assumption for  our pension expense for would change by approximately million 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would increase or decrease our pension expense for by approximately million 
we do not currently have minimum funding requirements  as set forth in erisa and federal tax laws 
we contributed million and million to the retirement plans in and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to the retirement plans in in addition  we have million of pension deferred actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates  differences between actual and assumed asset returns and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience actual earnings  rates of turnover and retirement 
these losses are amortized and included in future pension and retiree medical expense over the average employee service period of approximately five years 
although they are included in the liabilities disclosed in note retirement plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  they have not yet been reflected on our balance sheet 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after june  in april  the fasb announced that the effective date of sfas no 
r  had been delayed until the first quarter of sfas no

prior to october   in accordance with apb opinion  we recorded the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as expense
