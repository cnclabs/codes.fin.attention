item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing our consolidated financial position and our results of operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the summary of selected financial data  consolidated financial statements and related notes found under part ii  item and item contained herein 
in addition  you should read our discussion of critical accounting policies beginning on page for an explanation of those accounting estimates that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
overview we are a holding company incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands with our principal executive office in bermuda 
we are a reinsurer of life insurance  annuities and annuity type products 
these products are written by life insurance companies and other financial institutions located principally in the united states 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance north america 
we also specialize in niche markets in developed countries and broader life insurance markets in the developing world 
more recently  we have become actively engaged in the reinsurance of united kingdom and ireland traditional solutions business and annuity products 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance international 
life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international are each a reporting operating segment 
we directly issue variable life insurance and variable annuities and similar products to high net worth individuals and families for insurance  investment and estate planning purposes 
in prior years  we referred to this portion of our business as wealth management  which was another reportable operating segment 
as this business is no longer a material contributor to our results and we are no longer actively marketing this business  we have combined it with the corporate and other segment for all periods presented 
other revenues and expenses not related to life reinsurance are reported in the corporate and other segment 
the segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
we measure segment performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes 
on december   we completed the acquisition of the individual life reinsurance business of ing 
we reinsured the liabilities of all of ing s individual life reinsurance business through a coinsurance transaction 
ing transferred to us assets of approximately billion 
certain of these assets are held in trust to secure the reserve obligations of the business 
additionally  ing transferred to us certain operating assets associated with the business 
during  we fully integrated the ing acquisition with our existing us traditional business and migrated our charlotte based policy administration operations to denver 
we now administer our combined business with an enhanced version of the ing policy administration system  known as sage 
with the acquisition of the ing life reinsurance business  we have grown to be one of the three largest life reinsurers serving the united states 
on december   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of erc life corporation renamed scottish re life reinsurance corporation  for million in cash 
scottish re life corporation s business consists primarily of a closed block of traditional life reinsurance 
in  we established scottish re capital markets  inc  which is a registered broker dealer  formed to leverage the experience and expertise we have gained through our own efforts to deal with regulation xxx and other reserve requirements 
we believe scottish re capital markets can successfully assist our clients  both large and small  to effectively and efficiently access the capital markets to meet their reserving needs 
the most important factors we monitor to evaluate our financial condition and performance include o operations premiums  changes in the number of treaties and life insurance in force  investment results  claim frequency and severity trends  claims and benefit ratio and acquisition and expense ratios and operating earnings per share  o investments credit quality experience  stability of long term returns  cash flows and asset and liability duration  and o financial condition our financial strength ratings  financial leverage and growth in return on equity and book value per share 
highlights o net income was million in compared to million in net income available to ordinary shareholders per diluted share was in compared to in  an increase of  o total revenues reached a record billion  an increase of compared to last year  o on january   we completed a private offering of million collateral facility securities through stingray pass through trust 
this transaction allows us to use eligible assets as collateral in our reinsurance business and it will guarantee our ability and capacity to issue million of funding agreements in the future  without any capital market or execution risk at the time of issuance  o on february   we completed our first securitization of excess reserves arising from regulation xxx through an offering by orkney holdings  llc of million aggregate principal amount of year maturity securities  o in july  we completed a public offering of  non cumulative perpetual preferred shares with net proceeds of million  o during the fourth quarter of  we fully completed the integration of the ing acquisition with our existing united states traditional business and migrated our charlotte based policy administration operations to denver  o on december   we completed our second securitization of excess reserves arising from regulation xxx through an offering by an orphaned irish special purpose reinsurance company of million aggregate principal amount of year maturity securities  o in december  we completed a public offering of  ordinary shares which included an over allotment option of  shares in which we raised aggregate net proceeds of million 
in connection with the offering  we entered into variable share forward sales agreements whereby the forward purchasers agree to pay us an aggregate of approximately million on september  and an aggregate of approximately million on december   and o in december  we completed two transactions that together provided approximately billion in collateral to fund regulation xxx reserve requirements that were assumed in connection with the acquisition of ing s individual life reinsurance business 
revenues  expenses and other factors affecting profitability revenues we derive revenue primarily from premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business from existing treaties and from premiums on new treaties  investment income  realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio and fees from our financial solutions and wealth management businesses 
our primary business is life reinsurance  which involves reinsuring life insurance policies  with premiums earned typically over a period of to years 
each year  however  a portion of the business under existing treaties terminates due to  among other things  lapses or surrenders of underlying policies  deaths of policyholders and the exercise of recapture options by ceding companies 
premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business are included in revenues over the premium paying period of the underlying policies 
when we acquire blocks of in force business  we account for these transactions as purchases  and our results of operations include the net income from these blocks as of their respective dates of acquisition 
reinsurance assumed on annuity business does not generate premium income but generates investment income over time on the assets we receive from the ceding company 
we also earn revenues on funding agreements 
a deposit received on a funding agreement also does not generate premium income but does create income to the extent we earn an investment return in excess of our interest payment obligations thereon 
our investment income includes interest earned on our fixed income investments and income from funds withheld at interest under modified coinsurance agreements or coinsurance funds withheld agreements 
under gaap  because our fixed income investments are held as available for sale  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized appreciation depreciation on these securities is not included in investment income on our statements of income  but is included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities that we sell during a period  write downs of securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
expenses we have six principal types of expenses claims and policy benefits under our reinsurance contracts  interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities  acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  operating expenses  collateral finance facilities expense  and interest expense 
when we issue a life reinsurance contract  we establish reserves for claims and future policy benefits 
these reserves are our estimates of what we expect to pay in claims and policy benefits and related expenses under the contract or policy 
from time to time  we may change the reserves if our experience leads us to believe that benefit claims and expenses will ultimately be greater than the existing reserve 
we report the change in these reserves as an expense during the period when the reserve or additional reserve is established 
in connection with reinsurance of annuity and annuity type products  we record a liability for interest sensitive contract liabilities  which represents the amount ultimately due to the policyholder 
we credit interest to these contracts each period at the rates determined in the underlying contract  and the amount is reported as interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities on our consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the costs of acquiring new business  such as commissions  certain internal expenses related to our policy issuance and underwriting departments and other variable selling expenses are capitalized 
the resulting deferred acquisition costs asset is amortized over future periods based on our expectations as to the emergence of future gross profits from the underlying contracts 
these costs are dependent on the structure  size and type of business written 
for certain products  we may retrospectively adjust our amortization when we revise our estimate of current or future gross profits to be realized 
the effects of this adjustment are reflected in earnings in the period in which we revise our estimate 
acquisition costs also include letter of credit costs 
operating expenses consist of salary and salary related expenses  legal and professional fees  rent and office expenses  travel and entertainment expenses  directors expenses  insurance and other similar expenses  except to the extent capitalized in deferred acquisition costs 
collateral finance facilities expense includes costs incurred on our regulation xxx funding arrangements and other collateral finance facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest expense consists of interest charges on our long term debt and hycu instruments 
other factors affecting profitability we seek to generate profits from two principal sources 
first  in our life reinsurance business  we seek to receive reinsurance premiums and financial reinsurance fees that  together with income from the assets in which those premiums are invested  exceed the amounts we ultimately pay as claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
second  within our investment guidelines  we seek to maximize the return on our unallocated capital 
the following factors affect our profitability o the volume of business we write  o volume and amount of death claims incurred  o our ability to assess and price adequately for the risks we assume  o the mix of different types of business that we reinsure  because profits on some lines of business emerge later than on other lines  o our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to manage investment and liquidity risk  and o our ability to control expenses 
in addition  our profits can be affected by a number of factors that are not within our control 
for example  movements in interest rates can affect the volume of business that we write  the income earned from our investments  the interest we credit on interest sensitive contracts  the level of surrender activity on contracts that we reinsure and the rate at which we amortize deferred acquisition costs 
other external factors that can affect profitability include mortality experience that varies from our assumed mortality 
in addition  while death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years claims become less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to significant fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year 
other factors include changes in regulation or tax laws which may affect the attractiveness of our products or the costs of doing business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies given the nature of our business  our accounting policies require the use of judgments relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions and estimates underlying these accounting policies under different conditions or assumptions  the amounts reported in our financial statements could be materially different 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits  the capitalization and amortization of deferred acquisition costs  the valuation of present value of in force business  the valuation of investment impairments  the valuation of embedded derivatives  estimates of premiums  the valuation of tax balances and the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises applies to our traditional life policies with continuing premiums 
for these policies  reserves for future policy benefits are computed based upon expected mortality rates  lapse rates  investment yields  expenses and other assumptions established at policy issue  including a margin for adverse deviation 
once these assumptions are made for a given treaty or group of treaties  they will not be changed over the life of the treaty 
we periodically review actual historical experience and relative anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits 
further  we determine whether actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy reserves together with the present value of future gross premiums are sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits  settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs 
significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected losses on a group of treaties by establishing additional net reserves 
because of the many assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves and the long term nature of the reinsurance contracts  the reserving process  while based on actuarial science  is inherently uncertain 
we primarily rely on our own valuation and administration systems to establish reserves for future policy benefits 
the reserves for future policy benefits may differ from those established by ceding companies due to the use of different assumptions  based principally on actual and anticipated experience  including industry experience and standards 
we rely on our ceding companies  however  to provide accurate policy level data  including face amount  age  duration and other characteristics as well as underlying premiums and claims 
this data constitutes the primary information used to establish reserves for essentially all of our future policy benefits 
the use of reinsurance intermediaries in our transactions with ceding companies has been infrequent 
in the few instances in which intermediaries are involved  we receive data from the intermediary in a similar timeframe and fashion as if received directly from the ceding company 
claims payable for incurred but not reported losses are determined using case basis estimates and lag studies of past experience 
the time lag from the date of the claim or death to when the ceding company reports the claim to us can vary significantly by ceding company  but generally averages around months 
we update our analysis of incurred but not reported losses  including lag studies  on a quarterly basis and adjust our claim liabilities accordingly 
the adjustments in a given period have generally not been significant relative to the overall reserves for future policy benefits or our results of operations 
in the underwriting process  we perform procedures to evaluate the ceding company s process for compiling and reporting data 
after entering into a reinsurance contract  we work closely with our ceding companies to help ensure information submitted by them is in accordance with the underlying reinsurance contracts 
additionally  we have a dedicated compliance team that performs extensive audits  including on site audits and desk reviews  of the information provided by ceding companies 
in addition to ceding company audits  we routinely perform analysis  at a treaty level  to compare the actual results of ceding companies against initial pricing and expected results 
generally  there have been few disputes or disagreements with ceding companies and most are resolved through normal administration procedures 
occasionally  we experience processing backlogs and establish reserves for processing backlogs with a goal of clearing all backlogs as quickly as possible 
there were no significant processing backlogs at december  sfas no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments applies to investment contracts  limited premium contracts  and universal life type contracts 
for investment and universal life type contracts  future benefit liabilities are held using the retrospective deposit method  increased for amounts representing unearned revenue or refundable policy charges 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as a constant percentage of gross margins using assumptions as to mortality  persistency  and expense established at policy issue without provision for adverse deviation and are revised periodically to reflect emerging actual experience and any material changes in expected future experience 
liabilities and the deferral of acquisition costs are established for limited premium policies under the same practices as used for traditional life policies with the exception that any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into income as a constant percentage of insurance in force 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency  maintenance expense and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
reinsurance premiums from traditional life policies and annuity policies with life contingencies are generally recognized as revenue when due from policyholders and are reported net of amounts retroceded 
traditional life policies include those contracts with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  and consist principally of whole life and term insurance policies 
for our traditional life reinsurance business  we estimate assumed premiums using actuarial model projections at the treaty level 
consistent with reinsurance industry practices  these models use the most recent policy level data available from our ceding companies and our estimate of new business for treaties still open to new business 
the estimated premiums from the models are then compared to historical trends in reported assumed premiums by treaty and other information and adjusted if appropriate 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the adjustments in a given period have generally not been significant to the overall premiums or results of operations 
based on historical experience  the creditworthiness of ceding companies and our contractual right of offset  uncollectible assumed premium amounts have been infrequent and not material 
any provision for doubtful accounts would be recorded on a specific case by case basis 
the development of policy reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our products requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse  expense and investment experience 
such estimates are primarily based on historical experience and information provided by ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its assumptions and the related reserve estimates 
present value of in force business is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary and is amortized over the expected life of the business at the time of acquisition 
the amortization each year will be a function of the gross profits or revenues each year in relation to the total gross profits or revenues expected over the life of the business  discounted at the assumed net credit rate 
the determination of the initial value and the subsequent amortization require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future business results that could differ materially from actual results 
estimates and assumptions involved in the present value of in force business and subsequent amortization are similar to those necessary in the establishment of reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
our primary investments are in fixed maturity securities  including corporate and government bonds  asset and mortgage backed securities 
all our fixed maturity and preferred stock are classified as available for sale as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the difference from amortized cost included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the difference is net of related deferred acquisition costs and taxes 
fair values for fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
for fixed maturity securities that are not actively traded  fair values are estimated using values obtained from independent pricing services 
determining whether a decline in current fair values is other than a temporary decline in value for securities classified as available for sale can frequently involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded on established markets 
for instance  assessing the value of some investments requires an analysis of expected future cash flows 
management reviews securities with material unrealized losses and tests for other than temporary impairments on a quarterly basis 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to cost  length of time the value has been below cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
when a decline is considered to be other than temporary the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value and a corresponding realized investment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the actual value at which such financial instruments could actually be sold or settled with a willing buyer may differ from such estimated fair values 
as the discussion above indicates  there are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
these include subsequent significant changes in general overall economic conditions  as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers  future financial market effects such as interest rate spreads  future rating agency actions and significant accounting  fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments 
in addition  there are often significant estimates and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair values of securities  including projections of expected future cash flows and pricing of private securities 
we continually monitor developments and update underlying assumptions and financial models based upon new information 
see accounting pronouncements fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments for a discussion of potential changes to the requirements for other than temporary impairments in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our funds withheld at interest arise on modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance transactions 
derivatives implementation group issue no 
b embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate and credit rate risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument dig b indicates that these transactions contain embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivative feature in our funds withheld treaties is similar to a fixed rate total return swap on the assets held by the ceding companies 
the swap consists of two parts 
the first is the market value of the underlying asset portfolio and the second is a hypothetical loan to the ceding company 
the hypothetical loan is based on the expected cash flows of the underlying reinsurance liability 
we have developed models to systematically estimate the value of the total return swap 
the fair value of the embedded derivative is affected by changes in expected cash flows  credit spreads of the assets and changes in risk free interest rates 
the change in fair value is included in our calculation of estimated gross profits and  therefore  also affects the amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
in addition to our quota share indemnity funds withheld contracts  we have entered into various financial reinsurance treaties that  although considered funds withheld  do not transfer significant insurance risk and are recorded on a deposit method of accounting 
as a result of the experience refund provisions of these treaties the value of the embedded derivative is currently considered immaterial 
changes in our expectations of future cash flows could result in material changes to the financial statements 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
at december   we have net operating tax losses of million against which a valuation allowance of million has been established 
the deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon management s estimates of the future profitability of our taxable entities based on current forecasts and the period for which losses may be carried forward 
a valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized 
should the future income of these entities fall below expectations  a further valuation allowance would have to be established  which could be significant 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
and r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin and fin r which was originally issued in january fin r addresses whether certain types of entities  referred to as variable interest entities vies  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
a company must consolidate a vie in which it has an ownership  contractual or other financial interest if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary 
a primary beneficiary has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both 
we are the primary beneficiary of the collateral finance facilities discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  except for the stingray investor trust  and have consolidated the variable interest entities in accordance with fin r 
the stingray investor trust  discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  is a variable interest entity but we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of the investor trust 
accordingly  it is not consolidated in accordance with fin r 
consolidated results of operations our results of operations for the years ended december  and do not include the results of the acquisition of the ing individual life reinsurance business  which was completed on december  the results for the year ended december  include net income of million in respect of the results of scottish re life corporation for the period from december  to december  all amounts are reported in thousands of united states dollars  except per share amounts

the key drivers of the increase in investment income were the growth in our invested assets which arises from business growth and the ing acquisition  net proceeds of million from our offering of  non cumulative perpetual preferred shares in july and investment income earned on the invested assets from our regulation xxx initiatives completed during the year 
when analyzing the impact of net investment income on the results of the segment  it is important to understand that a portion of the investment income earned is credited to the policyholders of our fixed annuity products 
the interest credited to policyholders is included in the segment s expenses 
annuity product interest rate margins represent the excess of the yield on earning assets over the average crediting rate 
net realized gains were million higher in than improvements in the credit markets in resulted in less write downs for other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities million in as compared to million in we also realized a gain of million in compared to a loss of million for the same period in  resulting from the mark to market of an interest rate swap 
this derivative has not been designated as a hedge and  accordingly  changes in fair value are recorded in the determination of net income 
the change in value of the embedded derivatives arises from the application of dig b during the year ended december   we implemented the requirements of dig b which addresses whether sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
under dig b modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld reinsurance agreements where interest is determined by reference to a pool of fixed maturity assets  are arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
in addition  reinsurance contacts with experience refunds are also considered to be arrangements containing embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation 
dig b was effective for fiscal quarters beginning october  the change in the value of embedded derivatives decreased revenues by million in compared to an increase of million in this change in value arose principally because of the asset liability mismatch on modified coinsurance contracts assumed in the ing acquisition  coupled with a decrease in risk free interest rates and widening of credit spreads 
expenses total benefits and expenses in increased significantly compared to from million to billion or an increase of 
the increase in claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the ing business on december  and continued growth in our life reinsurance north america segment 
growth in interest credited reflects an increase in account balances and crediting rates on these balances 
additional operating costs in resulted from increased resources to support the growth in our business and million of additional costs necessary to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of collateral finance facilities expense in is impacted by the increased regulation xxx financing transactions completed during the year 
interest expense increased in due to full year of interest on the trust preferred offerings  interest on the cypress notes and increases in libor rates during when analyzing the impact of collateral finance facilities on the consolidated results  it is important to understand that this expense is offset by the investment income earned on the fixed maturity investments from the collateral finance facility transactions 
the net margin represents the excess of the yield on earning assets over the interest rate costs associated with the collateral finance facility 
our effective tax rate in each reporting period is determined by dividing the net tax benefit expense by our pre tax income or loss 
the change in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the amount in any reporting period of pre tax earnings attributable to different subsidiaries which changes from time to time  each of which may have different tax rates 
the change in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the relationship of pre tax income or losses in different jurisdictions 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
included in the tax benefit is a million expense related to a write off of a deferred tax asset related to state income taxes 
the income tax benefit is in respect of certain of our us taxable entities and our us entities  offset by income tax expenses arising on our irish entity and other us entities 
at december   we believe that it is more likely than not that all gross deferred tax assets will reduce taxes payable in future years except for a valuation allowance of million 
net income increased by  or million in compared to due to the reasons outlined above 
comparison of to revenues total revenues increased by in compared to the increase in premiums earned is primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of scottish re life corporation on december  and growth in the traditional solutions line of business in our life reinsurance north america segment

in the quarter ended december   the change in value of this derivative amounted to a gain of million

death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years  but are less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
during the second quarter of  we experienced higher than expected mortality which resulted in higher claims of approximately million 
this was due principally to a higher than expected number of large claims being incurred 
mortality was within expectations for the remainder of and thus overall mortality in was slightly higher than expected 
conversely  in  mortality experience in this business was slightly better than anticipated 
in  interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities increased by to million from million in the increase is due to interest credited on new reinsurance treaties and increases in interest credited on existing treaties due to increasing average liability balances

operating revenues are defined as total revenues excluding realized gains losses and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives 
excluding the impact of the million rebate received from ing related to fees paid on regulation xxx reserves  acquisition costs and other insurance expenses as a percentage of operating revenues were in overall  these percentages will fluctuate due to varying allowance levels within coinsurance type arrangements  the timing of amounts due to and from ceding companies  as well as the amortization pattern of previously capitalized amounts  which are based on the form of the reinsurance agreement and the underlying insurance policies 
additionally  the mix of first year coinsurance versus yearly renewable term can cause the percentage to fluctuate from period to period

when we originate each new reinsurance transaction  the price and terms are based on results of simulation models in which projected investment cash flows will match liability cash flows within reasonable tolerances 
the investment portfolio characteristics found to be most suitable for the liability are used to design the investment guidelines and target duration for the portfolio 
we currently manage our asset liability processes for over eighty individual portfolios 
liquidity expectations and requirements vary with the type of liability 
for liabilities with potentially greater liquidity demands  we select assets to make the corresponding portfolios more liquid and run more frequent simulations reflecting updated experience 
we periodically perform analyses  update guidelines and take other corrective action to keep the assets at the portfolio and enterprise level suitable for the relevant liabilities 
techniques include simulation of in force assets and liabilities in various interest rate scenarios  adjustment of duration targets for each portfolio  monitoring the gap between actual and target duration at the portfolio  legal entity and enterprise levels 
historically  variations between the maturity of our investment portfolio and our liabilities have been small 
funds withheld at interest funds withheld at interest arise on contracts written under modified coinsurance agreements and funds withheld coinsurance agreements 
in substance  these agreements are identical to coinsurance treaties except that the ceding company retains control of and title to the assets 
the deposits paid to the ceding company by the underlying policyholders are held in a segregated portfolio and managed by the ceding company or by investment managers appointed by the ceding company 
these treaties transfer a quota share of the risks 
the funds withheld at interest represent our share of the ceding companies statutory reserves 
the cash flows exchanged with each monthly settlement are netted and include  among other items  our quota share of investment income on our proportionate share of the portfolio  realized losses  realized gains amortized to reflect the statutory rules relating to interest maintenance reserve  interest credited and expense allowances 
at december   the funds withheld at interest totaled billion with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of as compared to billion with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of at december  these are fixed income investments and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the market value of the funds withheld amounted to billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
at december   funds withheld at interest were in respect of seven contracts with five ceding companies 
at december   funds withheld at interest were in respect of seven contracts with four ceding companies 
at december   we had three contracts with lincoln national life insurance company that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
additionally we had one contract with security life of denver international limited that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances and one contract with fidelity guaranty life that accounted for billion or of the funds withheld balances 
the remaining contracts were with illinois mutual insurance company and american founders life insurance company 
lincoln national life insurance company has financial strength ratings of a from am best  aa from standard poor s  aa from moody s and aa from fitch 
in the event of insolvency of the ceding companies on these arrangements we would need to exert a claim on the assets supporting the contract liabilities 
however  the risk of loss is mitigated by our ability to offset amounts owed to the ceding company with the amounts owed to us by the ceding company 
reserves for future policy benefits and interest sensitive contract liabilities relating to these contracts amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the investment objectives for these arrangements are included in the modified coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance agreements 
the primary objective is to maximize current income  consistent with the long term preservation of capital 
the overall investment strategy is executed within the context of prudent asset liability management 
the investment guidelines permit investments in fixed maturity securities  and include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash 
the maximum percentage of below investment grade securities is and other guidelines limit risk  ensure issuer and industry diversification  as well as  maintain liquidity and overall portfolio credit quality

in periods of growth of new business our operating cash flow may decrease due to first year commissions paid on new business generated 
for income recognition purposes these commissions are deferred and amortized over the life of the business 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities is principally due to the ing acquisition 
in  the decrease in operating cash flow in comparison with is partly attributable to settlement of a tax liability of approximately million 
this liability resulted from actions taken by the former owner of scottish re life corporation immediately prior to its acquisition in december when adjusted for this payment  cash inflows from operations in were million compared to inflows of million in this decrease is due to the timing of receipt of reinsurance receivables and settlement of reinsurance payables 
we believe cash flows from operations will be positive over time 
however  they may be positive or negative in any one period depending on the amount of new life reinsurance business written  the level of ceding commissions paid in connection with writing that business  the level of renewal premiums earned in the period and the timing of receipt of reinsurance receivables and settlement of reinsurance payables 
to address the risk that operating cash flows may not be sufficient in any given period we maintain a high quality  fixed maturity portfolio with positive liquidity characteristics 
these securities are available for sale and can be sold to meet obligations if necessary 
net cash used in investing activities was billion and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities and  in particular  the purchases of fixed maturity securities  are primarily related to the investment of the proceeds of the ing acquisition  the collateral finance facilities and the excess cash generated by operating and financing activities 
in we received million in cash on the completion of the ing acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion in and million in the increase was principally due to the receipt of proceeds on our collateral finance facilities and the issuance of ordinary shares and non cumulative perpetual preferred shares during the holding company we are a holding company whose primary uses of liquidity include  but are not limited to  the immediate capital needs of our operating companies  dividends paid to our shareholders and interest payments on our indebtedness 
see note  debt obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary sources of our liquidity include proceeds from our capital raising efforts  interest income on corporate investments and dividends from operating subsidiaries 
as we continue our expansion efforts  we will continue to be dependent upon these sources of liquidity 
historically  we have generated positive net cash flows from operations 
however  in the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond normal liquidity  we have multiple liquidity alternatives available based on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include borrowings under committed credit facilities  the ability to issue long term debt  capital securities or common equity and  if necessary  the sale of invested assets subject to market conditions 
capital total capitalization is analyzed as follows december  december  december  shareholders equity    mezzanine equity    long term debt    convertible junior subordinated notes  the increase in capitalization at december  compared to december  is principally due to net proceeds of million on the issuance of  ordinary shares including an over allotment option of  shares  net proceeds of million on the issuance of  non cumulative perpetual preferred shares  the conversion of the convertible junior subordinated note to ordinary shares and net income for the year ended december  of million 
these increases were partially offset by the net costs of the variable equity sale forward contracts of million  decrease in other comprehensive income of million and increase in dividends declared of million 
other comprehensive income consists of the unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments and the cumulative translation adjustment arising from the translation of scottish re holdings limited s balance sheet at exchange rates as of december  the increase in capitalization at december  compared to december  is due to the net income for the year ended december  of million  the issuance of ordinary shares and warrants and notes to the cypress entities  totaling million  the issuance of trust preferred debt of million  the issuance of share capital to employees on the exercise of options of million and an increase in other comprehensive income of million partially offset by an increase in dividends declared of million

the amount of dividends that we can pay will depend in part on the operations of our reinsurance subsidiaries 
collateral we must have sufficient assets available for use as collateral to support borrowings  letters of credit and certain reinsurance transactions 
with these reinsurance transactions  the need for collateral or letters of credit arises in five ways o when scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd  scottish re dublin limited or scottish re limited enters into a reinsurance treaty with a us customer  we must contribute assets into a reserve credit trust with a us bank or issue a letter of credit in order that the ceding company may obtain reserve credit for the reinsurance transaction  o when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction  it typically incurs a need for additional statutory capital 
this need can be met by its own capital surplus  an infusion of cash or assets from us or an affiliate or by ceding a portion of the transaction to another company within the group or an unrelated reinsurance company  in which case that reinsurer must provide reserve credit by contributing assets in a reserve credit trust or a letter of credit  o scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states and the district of columbia 
when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction with a customer domiciled in a state in which it is not a licensed  accredited  authorized or approved reinsurer  it likewise must provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit  o scottish re life corporation is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states  the district of columbia  guam and the federated states of micronesia 
when scottish re life corporation enters into a reinsurance transaction with a customer domiciled in a state in which it is not a licensed  accredited  authorized or approved reinsurer  it likewise must provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit  and o even when scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in a state  it may agree with a customer to provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit voluntarily to mitigate the counter party risk from the customer s perspective  thereby doing transactions that would be otherwise unavailable or would be available only on significantly less attractive terms 
assets placed in trust continue to be owned by us  but their use is restricted based on terms of the trust agreements 
we have a number of facilities in place to provide the collateral required for our reinsurance business

such amounts generally relate to incurred and reported death claims and amounted to million at december  as of december   reserves for future policy benefits of approximately billion related primarily to reinsurance of traditional life insurance and related policies and approximately billion of interest sensitive contract liabilities  primarily deferred annuities  have been excluded from this table because these amounts are generally comprised of policies or contracts where i we are not currently making payments and will not make payments in the future until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or disability or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract 
the timing of payment on these liabilities is not reasonably fixed and determinable since the insurable event or payment triggering event has not yet occurred  and we have no control over the timing of such occurrence 
in addition to timing of payments  significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity and persistency

 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and investments accounted for under the cost method should be considered other than temporary and recognized in income 
eitf also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment but has issued in november  fsp fas  which nullifies the guidance in paragraphs of eitf  and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
fsp fas clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell the security has not been made  and also provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for an impaired debt security

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we measure and manage market risks and other risks as part of an enterprise wide risk management process 
the market risks described in this section relate to financial instruments  primarily in our investment portfolio  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  credit risk premiums or spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
our investments  which are primarily fixed income securities  are subject to market value  reinvestment  and liquidity risk 
our invested assets are funded not only by capital but also by the proceeds of reinsurance transactions  some of which entail substantial deposits of funds or assets 
the cash flows required to pay future benefits are subject to actuarial uncertainties and  in some cases  the policies that we reinsure contain provisions that tend to increase benefits to customers depending on movements in interest rates 
we analyze the potential results of a transaction  including the cash flows of the liabilities and of the related assets  and any risk mitigation measures  and we price transactions to cover our costs  including estimated credit losses  and earn a desirable risk adjusted return under various scenarios 
we use interest rate swaps as tools to mitigate these risks 
we may also retrocede some risks to other reinsurers 
interest rate risk interest rate risk consists of two components in a falling rate scenario  we have reinvestment risk  which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities  and in a rising rate scenario  we have the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will then be trading at depreciated values 
with some annuity liabilities  these risks are compounded by variability in liability cash flows arising from adverse experience in withdrawals  surrenders  mortality  and election of early retirement 
we mitigate both components of risk through asset liability management  including the technique of simulating future results under a variety of interest rate scenarios and modifying the investment and hedging strategy to mitigate downside risk to earnings 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed maturity bond investments  of which the majority is at fixed interest rates 
for fixed rate investments backing reinsurance liabilities  the maturity structure has been designed to have approximately the same exposure to changes in interest rates as the related liabilities 
floating rate liabilities  including borrowings  are backed primarily by floating rate assets 
in the capital account  however  we own investments that are also sensitive to interest rate changes and this sensitivity is not offset by liabilities 
our overall objective is to limit interest rate exposure 
credit risk credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
we measure and manage credit risk not only of bond issuers but also of counter parties in reinsurance  retrocession and hedging transactions 
in our investment portfolio  credit risk is manifested in three ways o actual and anticipated deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issue  as may be reflected in downgrades in its ratings  tend to reduce its market value  o our managers might react to the actual or expected deterioration and or downgrade of an issuer by selling some or all of our positions  realizing a loss or a profit smaller than would have been realized if the deterioration or downgrade had not occurred  and o the issuer may go into default  ultimately causing us to realize a loss 
one of our key objectives in managing credit risk is to keep actual credit losses below both the amounts that we have assumed and allowed for in pricing reinsurance transactions and the amounts we would have lost  given the general level of experience for comparably rated securities of the same type in the general market 
we seek to prevent credit risk  in the aggregate  from becoming the dominant source of risk in our overall book of retained risks as a reinsurer 
we mitigate credit risk by adopting an investment policy  approved by our board of directors  which limits overall exposure to credit risk and requires diversification by limiting exposure to any single issuer 
we also use outside professional money management firms and monitor their capabilities  performance and compliance with our investment and risk management policies 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  our uk subsidiaries  scottish re holdings limited and scottish re limited  maintain operating expense accounts in british pounds  parts of their investment portfolios in euros and british pounds  and receive other currencies in payment of premiums 
all of scottish re limited s original us business is settled in united states dollars  all canadian  latin american and certain asia and middle east business is converted and settled in united states dollars  and all other currencies are converted and settled in euros or british pounds 
the results of the business recorded in euros and in british pounds are then translated to united states dollars 
we attempt to limit substantial exposures to foreign currency risk  but do not actively manage currency risks 
to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  we may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may enter into investment  insurance and reinsurance transactions in the future in currencies other than united states dollars 
our objective is to avoid substantial exposures to foreign currency risk 
we will manage these risks using policy limits  asset liability management techniques and hedging transactions 
sensitivity analysis change in interest rates we regularly conduct analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition 
techniques include  but are not limited to  comparison of option adjusted duration of assets and liabilities and simulation of future asset and liability cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios 
financial simulations are also used to evaluate exposure to credit spreads and will be used as we consider investments and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
on a monthly basis  we measure the gap between the effective duration of the investments and the target duration 
for assets supporting liabilities  we set the target duration to minimize interest rate risk for each liability transaction 
our investment policy limits the duration gap to years 
for floating rate borrowings and liabilities  we target floating rate assets  which have a duration near zero 
for capital account assets  we target a duration of years 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following tables provide information as of december  about the interest rate sensitivity of the portion of our investment portfolio managed by external managers 
the tables do not include other cash balances of billion  or funds withheld at interest of billion 
the tables show the aggregate amount  by book value and fair value  of the securities that are expected to mature in each of the next five years and thereafter  as well as the weighted average book yield of those securities 
the expected maturity is the weighted average life of a security and takes into consideration par amortization for mortgage backed securities  call features and sinking fund features 
in addition to the maturity structure of our controlled asset portfolio illustrated below  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and a maturity of july this swap is used to manage a portion of the interest rate exposure on the balance sheet and has the effect of shortening the duration on our overall controlled portfolio by years or approximately equivalent to reducing our four year maturity exposure by million 
december  market interest rates were used as discounting rates in the estimation of fair value 
expected maturity date total fair total thereafter total value principal amount         book value        weighted average book yield expected maturity date total fair fixed rate only thereafter total value principal amount         book value        weighted average book yield expected maturity date total fair floating rate only thereafter total value principal amount         book value        weighted average book yield
