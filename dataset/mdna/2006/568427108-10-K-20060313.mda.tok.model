item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products corporation  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail customers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floorplan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail customers  providing to our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to maximize profitability and reduce risk in the event of a downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly in the event of an industry downturn  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  maximizing shareholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of its common stock on the open market  aligning the interests of our management and shareholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of its various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
industry trends during were highlighted by higher wholesale and retail powerboat sales  although unit sales declined slightly  due to continued low interest rates  an improving domestic economy  and the continuation of the shift in consumer preferences towards safe recreational activities that take place close to home 
we believe that these sales increases moderated late in the third quarter and during the fourth quarter 
the severe hurricanes in the gulf of mexico caused extensive damage to many geographical areas that are popular for boating  sharp increases in the price of gasoline  and impacted consumer confidence and discouraged consumers from boating 
the stronger industry conditions were reflected in marine products financial results during  although we reduced production during the fourth quarter in order to maintain dealer inventories and backlog at appropriate levels and reduce risk in the event of a continued demand uncertainty in the industry 
early in  we increased our production in response to attendance and sales at the winter boat show season that was stronger than we originally anticipated 
the results of our strategies and the improved industry conditions in early are reflected in our financial results and operating statistics 
we generated record net sales and profits in net sales of million increased percent compared to the prior year 
net sales increased due to a percent increase in the average gross selling price per boat  and an increase in parts and accessories sales partially offset by a decrease in the number of boats sold 
average selling price per boat increased in each of our four boat lines 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent  lower than in the prior year 
our gross profit margin declined in  unlike the improvements realized during several prior years 
although we continued to execute our strategies of building larger  more profitable models and managing our production for optimum efficiency  these improvements were offset primarily by increases in the costs of certain raw materials in and manufacturing inefficiencies that resulted from lower production volumes during the fourth quarter 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  a decline from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this decline was concentrated in the smaller to foot size boats in our market 
we believe this was the result of two factors the execution of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats  and the strategy of certain of our competitors  who have built and sold a large number of entry level smaller boats which are constructed in offshore manufacturing plants with lower cost labor 
although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that net sales and profits will not increase in at the same rate realized in prior years due to the sales decline in the fourth quarter of and the uncertain near term outlook at the beginning of this belief is based on  among other things  reports of attendance and sales during the winter retail boat show exhibition season  which began in december both media reports of attendance and our sales results from these shows have been approximately equal to  or slightly higher than  the prior year 
boat show attendance has historically been positively correlated with retail boat sales later in the selling season because consumers attend shows due to their interest in recreational boating and make initial purchasing decisions at a boat show exhibition 
however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in or subsequent years 
pleasure boating is a discretionary consumer activity  and can be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates  rising fuel costs  and declines in consumer confidence due to a weakening economy or other factors  therefore  an increase in interest rates or a decline in consumer confidence could have a serious and immediate negative impact on net sales and profits 
although the general economy remains strong  in early we believe that the hurricanes that occurred in late have negatively impacted consumer sentiment regarding pleasure boating  due to continued media coverage regarding the long term destruction in the gulf coast and predictions of a bad hurricane season in we believe that these factors make consumers uncertain about the infrastructure that supports recreational boating and the future availability and price of fuel although concerns about the price and availability of fuel are not as serious in early as they were in the fourth quarter of over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have been improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
management believes that these efforts may result in increased advertising and other selling  general and administrative expenses in the future 
our ability to maintain or improve our net sales and profits in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  fuel costs  consumer confidence  the continued acceptance of our products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials 
results of operations all share data have been retroactively adjusted for the stock split effective march  and the stock split effective march  s in thousands total number of boats sold average gross selling price per boat net sales percentage of cost of goods sold to net sales percentage of selling  general and administrative expense to net sales operating income warranty expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by million or percent in compared to the increase was due to a percent increase in the average gross selling price per boat  and an increase in parts and accessories sales offset by a slight decrease in the number of boats sold 
the increase in average gross selling price per boat was due to higher sales of larger boats  in addition to overall price increases that were implemented for the model year  which began in july  as well as a price increase of approximately one percent that took effect in january to offset the higher cost of materials 
the increase in parts and accessories sales was a result of high demand for accessories ordered on base model boats and the higher numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent in compared to  slightly higher than the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods increased slightly in compared to  primarily due to increases in the cost of certain materials and components 
also contributing to the increase was higher transportation costs  primarily fuel  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from costs that vary with increased sales and profitability  such as incentive compensation  sales commissions and warranty expense  in addition to increased costs associated with public company compliance 
also contributing to the increase were the costs associated with listing the company shares for trading on the new york stock exchange

interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in marine products generates interest income from investment of its available cash primarily in overnight and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher percentage yields  consistent with recent increases in short term interest rates  partially offset by lower investable cash balances 
income tax provision 
the lower effective tax rate in of percent compalred to percent in resulted from the benefit of the new manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of and a contingency adjustment 
the decrease was also attributable to certain reductions in the tax provision resulting from the effect of these strategies reflected on prior year returns filed during and a tax benefit from a reduction in certain state tax liabilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by million or percent in compared to the increase was due to a percent increase in the number of boats sold  an percent increase in the average gross selling price per boat  and an increase in parts and accessories sales 
the increase in the number of boats sold was realized in the chaparral sportboat and deckboat lines  but included increased boat sales in all product lines 
the increase in average gross selling price occurred among all product lines as well  but was highest in the chaparral sportboat line  which sold more large sportboats than in  in addition to the overall price increases implemented for the model year that began in july in addition  the company eliminated the lower priced ss sportboat in increased sales of larger robalo sport fishing boats and chaparral cruisers were also responsible for the average gross selling price increase during the increase in parts and accessories sales was a result of the increasing numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent in compared to  consistent with the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods decreased slightly from to  because of leverage gained from higher production volumes and an overall shift in model mix to larger boats which typically generate higher gross margins 
this was partially offset by a significant increase in selected raw material costs  including stainless steel and resin costs from to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from costs that vary with increased sales and profitability  such as incentive compensation  sales commissions and warranty expense  in addition to increased costs associated with public company compliance

the million decrease in capital expenditures was offset by million net purchases of marketable securities 
capital expenditures in included higher costs than in to expand manufacturing facilities

in  the largest capital expenditures related to the completion of construction of the administrative building at chaparral s nashville  georgia headquarters which was begun in  the purchase of operating equipment  and the purchase of additional buildings for warehouse storage space 
cash used for financing activities increased million in compared to the increase resulted from higher cash amounts used to purchase the company s common stock in the open market  and an increase in dividends resulting from the company s decision during the first quarter of to increase its quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million  and are projected to include investment towards enhancements to certain manufacturing plants and the addition of a parts warehouse 
we expect that additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of approximately million will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective

based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual dividends expected to be paid would be approximately million 
the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
the company has an agreement with two employees  which provides for a monthly payment to each of the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market and as of december   can purchase  additional shares under the programs 
refer to issuer purchases of equity securities on page for details regarding shares purchased in the fourth quarter of the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  overall capitalization and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payment is known 
these amounts include primarily known pension plan funding obligations 
these amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various dealers and selected third party lenders to guarantee varying amounts of qualifying dealers debt obligations 
the company s obligation under these guarantees may become effective in the case of default by one or more dealers 
the agreements provide for the lender to return all repossessed boats in like new condition to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the dealers unpaid debt obligation on those boats 
the maximum contractual obligation and the amount outstanding under these agreements  which expire in and  was million as of december  the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee  at december   this amount is immaterial and did not change from the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  a dealer defaulted on its debt obligation to a floor plan lender related to approximately million of boat inventory 
subsequent to year end  the company assisted the lender in coordinating the redistribution of these boats among existing and replacement dealers 
management estimates that the ultimate cost to the company for these transactions and the impact on sales will be immaterial 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party

the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
in accordance with the agreement  rpc transferred approximately  in to the company related to tax settlements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the retail incentive programs have historically been used during off peak selling seasons in addition to the winter boat exhibition shows 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and our enforcement of those terms  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent for and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales has decreased in compared to because of the benefit the company expects to realize from recent quality improvement initiatives coupled with a focus on claims management processes 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized  and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
we establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods available are the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective application 
under the modified retrospective application  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective application would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
sfas no 
r states that the requirement is to adopt the provisions in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a new rule that allows companies to implement statement no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s view regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fas r 
fas r provides for a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
companies may elect either the guidance in sfas no 
r or this alternative transition method up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to make this one time election 
the company will implement the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently uses apb s intrinsic value method and recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation 
had we adopted earlier  the impact of sfas r would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our audited financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future partly because the company cannot predict the stock prices when i the employees exercise non qualified options or ii the restricted stock vests 
also  under the provision of sfas r  unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards are not recorded 
accordingly  any remaining unearned compensation related to unvested restricted stock awards and the corresponding amount in paid in capital will no longer be included in stockholders equity beginning january  based on stock options and restricted stock granted to employees through december   the company expects that the adoption of sfas r on january   will reduce first quarter net income by approximately  see note for further information on the company s stock based compensation plans 
the cumulative amount of excess tax deductions related to share based payment awards to employees computed in accordance with the provisions of sfas r is approximately  as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
by focusing the exception on exchanges that lack commercial substance  sfas intends to produce financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of the transaction 
sfas is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after june  and the provisions are to be applied prospectively 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas resulting in no material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
fasb staff position fsp no 
 application of fas to tax deduction on qualified production activities  issued in december fsp  provides guidance on the application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fsp is intended to clarify that the domestic manufacturing deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction rather than a rate reduction under sfas a special deduction is recognized under sfas as it is earned 
during the fourth quarter  the company completed a study to quantify the methodology and determine the deduction amount 
the provisions of fsp generated an after tax benefit of approximately  during in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and has been adopted by the company in the fiscal year ended december  adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company 
in may  the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle or a change required by a new accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented based on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  the company plans to adopt the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company
