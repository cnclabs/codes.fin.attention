state taxes per barrel vary on a state by state basis 
the decrease in excise taxes as a percentage of gross beverage sales in is related to a greater portion of beverage sales to states with lower excise taxes and in which distributors pay the excise tax as well as contract brewing arrangements in which the company incurs lower costs

the company does not believe that its net deferred assets meet the more likely than not realization criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been established 
the company will continue to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance 
net loss 
the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million in the increase in net loss was the result of the increasing cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  as described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company had a  balance of cash and cash equivalents and a million accounts receivable balance at december   a combined improvement of million over the prior year balances of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
the company s working capital remained negative at  but had improved substantially over negative working capital of million at 
table of contents december   which resulted primarily from the company using available cash in toward the purchase of the portland brewing assets 
working capital continues to be impacted by seasonality  the portland brewing integration costs and underutilized brewing capabilities 
net cash provided in operating activities for the year ended december  remained essentially flat in comparison with  at million  primarily due to the million net loss for the year  which included a  gain on the sale of excess brewery equipment  compared to million net loss in the same period last year  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  for the comparative periods 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to million in the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was due to capital purchases of  primarily related to the consolidation of brewing activities to the portland brewery site and other brewery projects which approximated  the purchases of approximately  of new kegs  as well as alehouse projects of  offset by proceeds from the sale of excess brewery equipment of approximately  the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was primarily due to the million acquisition of certain portland brewing assets  and purchases of fixed assets approximating million which included purchases of brewery equipment and improvements totaling approximately  net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the decrease in net cash used in financing activities from  was primarily due to a  decrease in cash dividends paid  offset by an increase in cash paid on the line of credit of approximately  additionally  the company incurred a financing cash requirement of  related to the buyback of company stock from the former ceo in the year ended december  in march  the company renegotiated its line of credit agreement with first mutual bank which makes available through march   a million line of credit 
a portion of the line of credit   has been reserved to support the standby letter of credit for the keg lease agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
any borrowings are subject to an interest rate of prime plus  fully floating  with a commitment fee 
under the terms of the agreement  the company must limit capital expenditures to million and adhere to certain financial performance covenants with a restriction on the payment of future dividends 
although the company had a working capital deficit as of december   because the beverage segment operates with relatively short accounts receivable terms and the alehouse segment operates as a cash business  the company typically tends to collect within days of a sale or immediately upon sale 
therefore  the company generally does not require significant cash on hand to meet operating needs 
even considering a possible adverse outcome from the ttb audit  the company believes that its cash flow from operating activities  tighter management of capital spending and cash management in combination with various financing options  including the line of credit  capital asset leasing and payment plan alternative would provide adequate working capital to meet the company s needs 
further  management believes that the consolidation of the majority of the company s seattle brewery production into the portland brewery will reduce production costs and help to meet rising demand for pyramid branded products 
the company plans to continue its focus on initiatives to further improve operating results which include driving sales volume growth of its core brand families in order to deliver revenue growth  increasing capacity utilization while decreasing fixed production costs through capital investment  judicious use of sales and marketing investment in programs which deliver positive returns  and achieving further operating efficiencies in the breweries to reduce costs and improve margin delivery 
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities for continued improvements and financial performance 
however  management anticipates utilizing the funds under the company s line of credit during the seasonally slow winter months  and it is possible that some or all of the company s cash requirements may not be met by these activities  which would require the company to seek additional capital from other sources 
alternative sources of capital may not be available to the company on attractive terms or at all 

table of contents other measures taken to manage cash flows include the board of director s decision announced in february  to cease paying dividends in order to reinvest the company s positive cash flow back into the business 
any future declaration of dividends will depend  among other things  on the company s results of operations  capital requirements and financial condition  bank covenants and on such other factors as the company s board of directors may in its discretion consider relevant 
future capital requirements may vary depending on such factors as the cost of acquisition of businesses  brands and real estate costs in the markets selected for future expansion  whether such real estate is leased or purchased and the extent of improvements necessary 
while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review  the company believes that its cash from operations and  to the extent required and available  bank borrowings  will be sufficient for the company s working capital needs 
contractual obligations at december   the company s commitment to make future payments under contractual obligations was as follows in thousands less than after total year years years years operating leases note payable the amounts are principal only payments as stated in securitized financing arrangement for the berkeley facility purchase 
in conjunction with the portland brewing asset purchase  the company entered into a year earn out earn out agreement with portland brewing company which may result in additional payments to portland brewing based on sales of portland brewing brands during the earn out period 
for the years ended december  and  there were no amounts owed under the earn out 
the company has obligations in the form of revenue sharing provisions in certain alehouse lease agreements  based on the excess of the percentage of revenue over the minimum lease payment 
for the years ended december    and there were no amounts owed under revenue sharing agreements 
contingencies the federal alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau ttb  which adopts and administers federal excise tax rules  is currently auditing the company s federal excise tax returns and related operations for the period of may  to november  among other operational and compliance matters that are being audited  the ttb is reviewing the company s contract brewing arrangement with portland brewing 
because the ttb audit is still underway  the company is unable at this time to predict the outcome of the ttb s review of this arrangement 
the company believes the outcome of the ttb s audit is uncertain because of possible differences between the company s and the ttb s interpretive positions on federal excise tax laws that relate to contract brewing arrangements 
the ttb recently announced that beginning september  it will adopt a more restrictive application of the excise tax rules with respect to two or more small brewers operating alternatively at the same brewery  an arrangement known under federal regulations as alternating proprietorships 
although the contract brewing arrangement between the company and portland brewing is materially different from an alternating proprietorship arrangement  both may result in tax reductions relative to production by a single proprietor  and the ttb s announcement regarding alternating proprietorships may indicate an intent to apply a restrictive interpretation of the excise tax rules that apply to contract brewing relationships 
if the ttb were to conclude that the contract brewing arrangement with portland brewing did not  for some period  qualify under the applicable legal requirements for such arrangements  the company believes 
table of contents that the ttb would impute to the company the production and or removals from bond of beer produced at the brewery 
in that case  the ttb could assert a claim against the company for underpayment of federal excise taxes for prior periods  as well as interest and penalties 
in particular  if the ttb concluded that the arrangement with portland brewing during prior periods did not qualify as a contract brewing arrangement  the ttb may assess an amount equal to the standard per barrel excise tax on all production and removals from bond at the brewery  as well as interest and penalties 
including penalties  the company s aggregate exposure could amount to approximately million for the period from august   when the contract brewing arrangement went into effect  through december  an assessment of the magnitude of the high end of the range would materially adversely affect the company s liquidity 
moreover  an adverse determination by the ttb could deny the company the intended financial benefits of the arrangements in future periods  which could negatively impact the company s profitability in the future 
the company would consider appealing any adverse determination by the ttb 
if the company elected not to appeal the ttb s determination or was not successful on appeal  it would pursue a number of alternatives to minimize the impact on the company s liquidity 
first  the company would attempt to negotiate a deferred payment plan for any significant assessment 
the company believes that acceptance of installment payment of such an assessment would be consistent with past ttb practice 
second  the company has available its line of credit which could be used to satisfy a significant portion of any assessment by the ttb 
if necessary  the company would seek to arrange other financing to provide funds for the satisfaction of any significant ttb assessment 
the company can provide no assurance that a deferred payment plan could be worked out with the ttb  that it will be successful in renewing its existing line of credit  or that it will be able to arrange other financing 
in addition to the matter discussed above  the company is involved from time to time in claims  proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not believe that any such claim  proceeding or litigation  either alone or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

we evaluate our accounting estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies and estimates include the following inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market

long lived assets to be disposed of are evaluated in relation to the estimated fair value of such assets less the estimated costs to sell 
long lived assets are written down to their estimated net fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flow analysis in the event of an impairment 
if circumstances related to the company s long lived assets change  the company s valuation of the long lived assets could materially change 
goodwill impairment

the evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is based on existing deferred tax liabilities and an assessment of the company s ability to generate future us taxable income 
the company records a valuation allowance to the extent that recovery is not likely 
if circumstances related to the company s ability to generate future us taxable income change  the company s evaluation of its ability to realize its deferred tax assets could materially change 
promotional activities 
throughout the year  the company s sales force engages in promotional activities with the company s distributor and retail customers 
in connection with financial statement preparation and other financial reporting  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures resulting from these activities 
actual expenditures incurred could differ from management s estimates and assumptions 
if management s estimates and assumptions differ from the actual promotional activities incurred a timing difference could result either understating or overstating the actual promotional activity expense in a subsequent period 
because of the nature of promotional activities and the historical trends used in management analysis  management does not consider the potential timing differences to be a significant risk in the financial statement presentation 
allowance for keg deposits 
the company purchases kegs from vendors and records these assets in property  plant and equipment
