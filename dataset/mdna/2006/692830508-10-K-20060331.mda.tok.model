consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million to million 
revenues increased approximately million  or  at countrywide  which includes revenues at woodmark and nationwide

also important is the value of the dollar in relation to the japanese yen and the twd  as the company spends approximately million in these currencies annually 
additionally  the company purchases approximately million of products from china 
these purchases are made in us dollars 
however  if the chinese currency  the renminbi rmb  were to be revalued against the dollar  there could be a significant negative impact on the cost of the company s products 
key elements for the demand for the company s products include retail sales and housing starts 
during  the value of the us dollar increased in relation to the japanese yen and decreased in relation to the twd 
when comparing the change in the weighted average value of the company s foreign currency purchases in compared to  the increase in the value of the dollar was approximately in relation to the japanese yen and the decrease in the value of the twd was approximately in relation to the us dollar 
based on our purchases from these countries  the net weakening of the us dollar in taiwan  offset by the net strengthening of the us dollar in japan  resulted in an increase in the cost of imported product in of approximately  although there can be no certainty  the company does not expect these rates to vary significantly in the next year 
in  retail sales improved over  and strong housing starts continued in the northeast and south 
housing starts for the year were up over the prior year 
housing starts are a strong driver of demand for both woodmark and nationwide

to the extent that these measures are relevant  they are discussed in the detailed sections for each operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of these accounting policies require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets and warranty reserves 
the company bases its estimates on historical data and experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
other than standard product warranty provisions  the company s sales arrangements provide for no other  or insignificant  post shipment obligations 
the company does offer rebates and other sales incentives  promotional allowances or discounts  from time to time and for certain customers  typically related to customer purchase volume  all of which are fixed or determinable and are classified as a reduction of revenue and recorded at the time of sale 
the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced little  if any  sales returns 
if the company believes there are potential sales returns  the company would provide any necessary provision against sales 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts senior management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
analysis of customer history  financial data and the overall economic environment is performed 
in addition  balances outstanding for more than days are evaluated for possible inclusion in the accounts receivable reserve 
collection agencies are also utilized 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible 
the company also records as an additional allowance a certain percentage of aged accounts receivable  based on historical experience and the company s assessment of the general financial conditions affecting its customer base 
if actual collection experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
the company has a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in the creditworthiness of any of these customers could have a material affect on the company s results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect an account receivable have failed  the amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available  the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the inventory balance  which includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
such allowance is based upon both historical experience and management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
in addition  items in inventory in excess of one year s usage are compared to the allowance for adequacy 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net earnings would be significantly affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is carried at cost 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual test for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using the expected present value of future cash flows  giving consideration to the market valuation approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of the respective assets  generally five to fifteen years 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset
