information systems our information system  which is based upon licensed software  has been  and continues to be  customized specifically by our management to meet the specific needs of our business 
the system allows management to access and have total control over information related to all aspects of our business  including customer relationship management  intelligent purchasing  inventory control  inventory flow  back orders  line item margin control for every order  and weighted average cost and statistical data for every product  customer and supplier 
management believes that our information systems have allowed us to provide better service to customers  which we believe leads to increased customer satisfaction and resulting customer retention and future sales 
vendors we have established key relationships with many of the leading manufacturers of wireless telecommunications equipment 
in  we purchased inventory from more than wireless mobile device and accessory manufacturers and other suppliers 
certain of our suppliers  depending on any number of factors including manufacturer promotion  product introduction  and sales volume  among others  may provide favorable purchasing terms to us  including price protection  cooperative advertising  volume incentive rebates  stock balancing and marketing allowances 
some of these terms are provided for in our contracts  whereas others are offered from time to time when the manufacturer desires to do so 
product manufacturers typically provide limited warranties directly to the end user 
in  samsung electronica da amazonia ltda  samsung telecommunications america and samsung electronics latinoamerica columbia sa accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total cost of sales 
we have distribution agreements with each of these three vendors 
loss of one of our individual contracts with a samsung affiliate or another of our suppliers  or failure by the manufacturers to supply competitive products on a timely basis  at competitive market prices and on favorable terms  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and operating margins and our ability to obtain and deliver products to market on a timely and competitive basis 
as of march   we have written agreements with seven of our supplier manufacturers for distribution in the united states and latin america  including the three samsung affiliates mentioned in the previous paragraph 
these agreements are subject to certain conditions and exceptions  primarily concerning the retention by these suppliers of certain direct accounts  and restrictions of territory regarding our resale of products 
in addition  we purchase products from other manufacturers and suppliers pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business for products to be sold in the united states  latin america and specific countries or geographic areas outside the americas 
all our agreements with suppliers are non exclusive  with the exception of one manufacturer in which we have exclusive product distribution rights in the united states  canada  latin america and the caribbean region 
although we do not have written agreements with all of our manufacturers and suppliers  we believe we will have adequate product flows in the future to fulfill our reasonably foreseeable product requirements 
sales and marketing we believe that direct selling and one on one relationships  as well as in depth product and competitive landscape knowledge  are important factors in the marketing of the products that we sell 
accordingly  we promote relationship building and maintenance through personal contact and advertising in industry publications  both print and on line  and attending the major national and regional carrier shows 
we also operate a co branded on line store to sell wireless products directly to consumers  providing them the flexibility to place orders at any time of day 
our suppliers and customers use a variety of methods to promote their products and services directly to consumers  including print and media advertising 
as of december   we employed seven experienced sales and marketing professionals who are involved in distribution and who market to existing and potential customers in their respective assigned territories through in person meetings  telephone  and e mail interaction and notification of special promotions 
potential new customers are located primarily through our database  as well as industry publications and journals 
each sales person is compensated based on handset sales  customer acquisition and retention and profitability

see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for additional information regarding geographic revenue 
as of december   all of our long lived assets were in the united states 
seasonality our business historically has experienced increased sales during the third and the fourth quarters of the calendar year due to holiday gift buying 
in addition  if unanticipated events occur  including delays in securing adequate inventories of competitive products at times of peak sales or significant decreases in sales during these periods  it could result in a material decrease in our revenues and losses or lower profits 
our operations may be influenced by a number of seasonal factors in the countries and markets in which we operate 
other factors that may also cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and include  without limitation promotions and subsidies by mobile operators  timing of the introduction of new products by our suppliers and competitors  purchasing patterns of customers in different markets  general economic conditions  and product availability and pricing 
competition the industry and markets where we operate are highly competitive and such competition may increase in the future 
wireless handsets are subject to price competition and price erosion over the lives of the products 
we compete on a number of factors including product pricing  level of services offered  market and product knowledge  customer service  product availability and overall value provided to the customers 
our competitors could possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  which could enable them to withstand substantial price competition  launch new products and implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns 
historically  the barriers to entry have been relatively low for the distribution of wireless handsets 
our ability to continue to compete successfully will be largely dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive and other factors affecting the industry  including new or changing outsourcing requirements  new information technology requirements  new product introductions  inconsistent or inadequate supply of product  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  regional and local economic conditions  and discount pricing strategies and promotional activities by competitors 
we compete for sales of wireless telecommunications equipment and accessories  and anticipate that we will continue to compete  with well established carriers and distributors 
manufacturers  including our own suppliers  also sell their products directly to some large carriers  and as these carriers grow in size  they may pose more of a competitive threat to our business by circumventing our distribution system in favor of doing business directly with manufacturers 
our competitors in the united states and latin america include wireless equipment manufacturers  carriers and other dedicated wireless distributors such as brightpoint  inc  brightstar corporation and cellstar corporation 
see item a risk factors risks relating to our business the wireless telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete against well established competitors with greater financial and other resources 
employees as of december   we had employees 
of these employees  five were in executive positions  seven were engaged in sales and marketing not including six sales contractors  nine were in service operations  and seven were in finance and administration including information technology employees 
from time to time  we utilize temporary employees to perform warehouse functions 
our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
recent developments subsequent to fiscal year end on january   we sold an aggregate  shares of our common stock at per share  for total gross proceeds of  the purchasers were also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share during the period beginning six months after the date of the purchase agreement and ending four years later 
we also issued three year term warrants to purchase a total of  shares to the placement agents in the offering 
of the total number of placement agent warrants  warrants to purchase  shares have an exercise price of per share and  have an exercise price of per share 
the placement agents also received cash compensation equal to of the gross proceeds raised in the offering plus incidental expenses 
item a 
risk factors risks relating to our business our operating results may vary significantly  which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  which may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate greatly 
these factors include product availability and pricing  the addition or loss of supplier or customer relationships  the timing of introduction of new products by our suppliers and competitors  purchasing patterns of customers in different markets  general economic conditions  and promotions and subsidies by carriers we buy a significant amount of our products from a limited number of suppliers  who may not provide us with competitive products at reasonable prices when we need them in the future 
we purchase wireless handsets and accessories principally from wireless communications equipment manufacturers and distributors 
we depend on these suppliers to provide us with adequate inventories of currently popular brand name products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing and other terms 
in  three vendors accounted for  and respectively of our total cost of sales 
we currently have one exclusive and several non exclusive agreements with our principal suppliers  which can be terminated on short notice and provide for certain territorial restrictions 
our suppliers may not offer us competitive products on favorable terms or with timely delivery 
in addition new products from other manufacturers could impact the demand for products from manufacturers we represent 
from time to time  we have been unable to obtain sufficient product supplies 
any failure or delay by our suppliers  particularly our three primary vendors  in supplying us with products on favorable terms may severely diminish our ability to obtain and deliver products to our customers on a timely and competitive basis 
if we lose any of our principal suppliers  or if these suppliers are unable to fulfill our product needs  or if any principal supplier imposes substantial price increases and alternative sources of supply are not readily available  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our continuing liabilities on leases from our former mall based retail kiosk locations could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flow 
although we have assigned our five remaining retail leases to a third party and we have received indemnification from the third party  we remain liable to the lessor for the respective remaining lease terms of one or two years  if the third party does not fulfill its obligations under the leases 
as of december  the total potential liability under these leases was  exclusive of a  escrow deposit held for our benefit to the extent that the third party should default on any of the assigned leases 
this escrow is not reflected on our financial statements 
this lease liability is included in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
the loss or reduction in orders from principal customers or a reduction in prices we are able to charge these customers will have a negative impact upon our revenues and could cause our stock price to decline 
our four largest customers in fiscal represented   and of our net sales 
all four of these customers are carriers in latin america and the united states 
the markets we serve are subject to severe price competition 
additionally  our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase product from us 
for these and other reasons such as competitive pricing and competitive pressures  customers may seek to obtain products or services from us at lower prices than we have been able to obtain from these customers in the past 
this could occur  for example  in the case of a customer purchasing large quantities of a product from us  who then terminates this relationship because the customer can obtain a lower price by buying directly from the manufacturer 
the loss of any of our principal customers  a reduction in the amount of product or services our principal customers order from us or the inability to maintain current terms  including price  with these or other customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we have experienced losses of certain customers through industry consolidation and ordinary course of business and there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase products or services from us or that their purchases will be at the same or greater levels than in prior periods 
our future profitability depends on our ability to maintain existing margins and our ability to increase our sales  which we may not be able to do 
the gross margins that we realize on sales of wireless handsets could be reduced due to increased competition or a growing industry emphasis on cost containment 
therefore  our future profitability will depend on our ability to maintain our margins or to increase our sales to help offset potential future declines in margins 
we may not be able to maintain existing margins for products or services offered by us or increase our sales 
our ability to generate sales is based upon demand for wireless telecommunications products and our having an adequate supply of these products 
even if our sales rates do increase  the gross margins that we receive from our sales may not be sufficient to make our future operations profitable or as profitable 
our business depends on the continued tendency of wireless equipment manufacturers and carriers to outsource aspects of their business to us 
our business depends in large part on wireless equipment manufacturers and carriers outsourcing some of their business functions to us 
we provide functions such as product approval and testing  inventory management  product fulfillment  preparation of product kits  and customized packaging  light assembly and end user support services 
certain wireless equipment manufacturers and carriers have elected  and others may elect  to undertake these services internally 
additionally  our customer service levels  industry consolidation  competition  deregulation  technological changes or other factors could reduce the degree to which members of the wireless telecommunications industry rely on outsourced services such as the services we provide 
any significant change in the market for these services could have a material adverse effect on our current and planned business 
we may not be able to effectively compete in our industry if consolidation of carriers continues 
the past several years have witnessed a consolidation within the carrier community 
if this trend continues  it could result in a reduction or elimination of promotional activities by the remaining carriers as they seek to reduce their expenditures which could  in turn  result in decreased demand for our products or services 
moreover  consolidation of carriers reduces the number of potential contracts available to us 
we could also lose business if carriers  which currently are our customers  are acquired by other carriers which are not our customers 
wireless operators may also change their policy regarding sales to their agents by independent distributors  such as requiring those agents to purchase products from the carrier or manufacturer  rather than from distributors such as us 
this type of requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our sales and inventory risk may be materially affected by fluctuations in regional demand patterns and economic factors for which we cannot plan 
the demand for our products and services has fluctuated and may continue to vary substantially within the regions served by us 
we believe the roll out of third generation  or g  cellular telephone systems and other new technologies  which have been delayed and could further be delayed  have had and will continue to have an effect on overall subscriber growth and handset replacement demand 
economic slow downs in regions served by us or changes in promotional programs offered by carriers may lower consumer demand for our products and create higher levels of inventories which could decrease our gross and operating margins 
we could face a substantial inventory risk due to depreciation and equipment price erosion if our products are not sold in a timely manner 
we may not be able to adequately respond to rapid technological changes in the wireless telecommunications industry  which could cause us to lose customers 
the technology relating to wireless telecommunications equipment changes rapidly resulting in product obsolescence or short product life cycles 
we are required to anticipate future technological changes in our industry and to continually identify  obtain and market new products in order to satisfy evolving industry and customer requirements 
while our top three vendors have historically kept their products competitive in terms of technological changes  there is no guarantee they will continue to do so  which could materially effect our business 
competitors or manufacturers of wireless equipment may market products which have perceived or actual advantages over products that we handle or which otherwise render those products obsolete or less marketable 
we have made and continue to make significant capital investments in accordance with evolving industry and customer requirements including maintaining levels of inventories of currently popular products that we believe are necessary based on current market conditions 
this utilization of capital for inventory buildup of this nature increases our risk of loss due to product obsolescence 
furthermore  if we do not adequately anticipate future technological changes  we may not have established adequate relationships with suppliers 
substantial defaults by our customers on accounts receivables could have a significant negative impact on our cash flow and financial condition 
we currently offer and intend to offer open account terms to certain of our customers  both large and small  which may subject us to credit risks  particularly to the extent that our receivables represent sales to a limited number of customers or are concentrated in particular geographic markets 
although we have an accounts receivable insurance policy  this policy carries a substantial deductible and may not cover us in all instances 
we also have an accounts receivable based credit facility in order to reduce our working capital requirements 
the extent of our ability to use our accounts receivable based credit facility is dependent on the amount of and collection cycle of our accounts receivable 
adverse changes in our ability to use accounts receivable financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we rely on our suppliers to provide favorable terms  including payment terms  in order for us to make appropriate product purchases  and without such terms  our ability to procure products could be reduced 
our business is dependent on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of currently popular products on favorable pricing and other terms 
our ability to fund our product purchases is dependent on our principal suppliers providing favorable payment terms that allow us to maximize the efficiency of our capital usage 
the payment terms we receive from our suppliers are dependent on several factors  including  but not limited to  our payment history with the supplier  the suppliers credit granting policies  contractual provisions  our overall credit rating as determined by various credit rating agencies  industry conditions  our recent operating results  financial position and cash flows and each supplier s ability to obtain credit insurance on amounts that we owe them 
adverse changes in any of these factors  certain of which may not be wholly in our control  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
approximately of our revenues during the fiscal year ended december  were generated outside of the united states in countries that may have volatile currencies or other risks 
we engage in significant sales activities in territories and countries outside of the united states  particularly latin american countries  including argentina in the fact that we distribute products into a number of countries exposes us to increased credit risks  customs duties  import quotas and other trade restrictions  potentially greater and more unpredictable inflationary pressures  and shipping delays 
changes may occur in social  political  regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment in the territories and countries where we currently distribute products 
united states laws and regulations relating to investment and trade in foreign countries could also change to our detriment 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
although we purchase and sell products and services in united states dollars and do not engage in exchange swaps  futures or options contracts or other hedging techniques  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could reduce demand for products sold in united states dollars 
we cannot predict the effect that future exchange rate fluctuations will have on our operating results 
we may in the future engage in currency hedging transactions  which could result in our incurring significant additional losses 
we rely on our information technology system to function efficiently  without interruptions  and if it does not  customer relationships could be harmed 
we have focused on the application of our information technology system to provide customized services to wireless communications equipment manufacturers and carriers 
our ability to meet our customers technical and performance requirements is highly dependent on the effective functioning of our information technology systems  which may experience interruptions  including aspects provided by third party providers 
these business interruptions could cause us to fall below acceptable performance levels pursuant to our customers requirements and could result in the loss of the related business relationship 
some of our information technology systems are managed and operated by third party providers 
all information technology systems  both internal and external  are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including  without limitation  computer viruses  security breaches  energy blackouts  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication failures and third party provider failures 
we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions  but a systems failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
we have outstanding indebtedness  which is secured by substantially all our assets and which could prevent us from borrowing additional funds  if needed 
we had outstanding debt in the amount of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  in the form of a bank line of credit of up to million at december   the borrowing base of which is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable 
if we violate our loan covenants  default on our obligations or become subject to a change of control  our indebtedness would become immediately due and payable 
any significant decrease in our level of eligible accounts receivable will reduce our ability to borrow additional funds to adequately finance our operations and expansion strategies 
the terms of our credit facility could substantially prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness  which could limit our ability to expand our operations 
we are also subject to negative covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to sell certain assets and make certain payments  including but not limited to  dividends  repurchases of common stock and other payments outside the normal course of business  as well as prohibiting us from merging or consolidating with another corporation or selling all or substantially all of our assets 
we depend on third parties to manufacture products that we distribute and  accordingly  rely on their quality control procedures 
product manufacturers typically provide limited warranties directly to the end consumer or to us  which we generally pass through to our customers 
if a product we distribute for a manufacturer has quality or performance problems  our ability to provide adequate products to our customers could be disrupted and our reputation could be negatively affected  thereby adversely impacting our business 
the wireless telecommunications industry is intensely competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete against well established competitors with greater financial and other resources 
we compete for sales of wireless telecommunications equipment and accessories  and expect that we will continue to compete  with numerous well established carriers  distributors and manufacturers  including our own suppliers 
many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources than we do and may market similar products or services directly to our customers 
distribution of wireless telecommunications equipment and accessories has generally had low barriers to entry 
as a result  additional competitors may choose to enter our industry in the future 
the markets for wireless handsets and accessories are characterized by intense price competition and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
many of our competitors have the financial resources to withstand substantial price competition and to implement extensive advertising and promotional programs  both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors to enter into new markets or introduce new products 
our ability to continue to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to maintain our current industry relationships  both manufacturers and carrier customers 
we may not be successful in anticipating and responding to competitive factors affecting our industry  including new or changing outsourcing requirements  the entry of additional well capitalized competitors  new products which may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  international  national  regional and local economic conditions and competitors discount pricing and promotion strategies 
as wireless telecommunications markets mature and as we seek to enter into new markets in the latin american region and offer new products in the future  the competition that we face may change and grow more intense 
our continued growth depends on retaining our current key employees and attracting additional qualified personnel  and we may not be able to continue to do so 
our success depends in large part on the abilities and continued service of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly joseph ram  our chief executive officer 
although we have entered into employment agreements with several of our officers and employees  including mr 
ram  we may not be able to retain their services under applicable law 
the loss of executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  in order to support our continued growth  we will be required to effectively recruit  develop and retain additional qualified management 
if we are unable to attract and retain additional necessary personnel  it could delay or hinder our plans for growth 
we rely on trade secret laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights  and there is no assurance that these laws or agreements adequately protect our rights 
we rely on trade secret laws to protect our proprietary knowledge  particularly our database of customers and suppliers and business terms such as pricing 
in general  we also have non disclosure agreements with our key employees and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these measures may prove difficult to enforce and may not prove adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
we may become subject to suits alleging medical risks associated with our wireless handsets  and the cost of these suits could be substantial  and divert funds from our business 
lawsuits or claims have been filed or made against manufacturers of wireless handsets over the past years alleging possible medical risks  including brain cancer  associated with the electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless communications handsets 
there has been only limited relevant research in this area  and this research has not been conclusive as to what effects  if any  exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless handsets has on human cells 
substantially all of our revenues are derived  either directly or indirectly  from sales of wireless handsets 
we may become subject to lawsuits filed by plaintiffs alleging various health risks from our products 
if any future studies find possible health risks associated with the use of wireless handsets or if any damages claim against us is successful  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even an unsubstantiated perception that health risks exist could adversely affect our ability or the ability of our customers to market wireless handsets 
risks related to our common stock stockholders may be diluted as a result of future offerings or other financings 
we may need to raise additional capital through one or more future public offerings  private placements or other financings involving our securities 
as a result of these financings  ownership interests in our company may be greatly diluted 
see our discussion of our recent sale of common stock and warrants described in item company business recent developments subsequent to fiscal year end in this form k 
our common stock  and our stock price could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial loss on your investment 
prior to our initial public offering in june  there was not a public market for our common stock 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained  which could affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares and could depress the market price of their shares 
the stock market in general and the market for telecommunications related stocks in particular  has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risk factors section 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
shares of common stock that are issuable pursuant to our stock option plans and our outstanding warrants  when issued  could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we have reserved shares of common stock that may be issuable pursuant to our stock option plans and to our outstanding options and warrants outside those plans 
these securities  when issued and outstanding  may reduce earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  to the extent that they are exercised and shares of common stock are issued  dilute percentage ownership to existing stockholders which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies or effect a change in control of our company is limited  which may not be in our stockholders best interests 
some provisions of our charter and bylaws and the general corporation law of maryland  where we are incorporated  may delay or prevent a change in control of our company or other transactions that could provide our common stockholders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock or that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
these include the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which preferred stock may have voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions can occur 
these provisions of maryland law may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us even if the acquisition would be advantageous to our stockholders 
our largest stockholder may have strategic interests that differ from those of our other stockholders  and he may be able to significantly influence important corporate matters 
as of march   joseph ram  our chief executive officer beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
ram may be able to significantly influence corporate actions relating to control the composition of our board of directors  control our management and policies  determine the outcome of significant corporate transactions  including changes in control that may be beneficial to stockholders  and act in their mutual interests  which may conflict with  or be different from  the interests of other stockholders

industry trends  challenges  risks and growth opportunities according to a february report by jp morgan chase co  in  overall worldwide wireless handset sales increased by approximately  and are forecasted to increase in a rapid decline in wireless handset sales growth could negatively impact our net sales 
excess supply conditions can reduce the market prices of the products we sell and therefore affect our ability to generate net sales and gross profit at historical levels and could affect the value of our inventory 
conversely  should manufacturers be unable to respond to an unanticipated increase in demand on a timely basis  we  along with others in our industry  could experience supply constraints that would affect our ability to deliver products 
we are unable to quantify these effects  as it is difficult to predict future supply conditions and demand patterns which affect our ability to meet customer demand or sell handsets at an acceptable gross profit 
see item description of business market trends and factors and item a risk factors 
company specific trends  challenges risks and growth opportunities in  our net sales increased by  and handset units sold increased by 
although we have incorporated growth into our strategy  there can be no assurances that these trends will continue 
similarly  although we have experienced high levels of growth in operating income from continuing operations increase over the prior year  we cannot anticipate future growth to be at the same levels 
our strategy incorporates overall growth elements for each aspect of our business  which we hope will result in continued earnings growth  however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue

in january  we raised million gross proceeds from sales of our common stock 
we believe our cash balance is adequate for the next twelve months 
credit facility we previously had a line of credit with comerica bank that was replaced on october  by our current line of credit 
we have a fully collateralized line of credit with wells fargo hsbc trade bank na that allows us to borrow up to a maximum of million with a maturity date of october  although we cannot assure that this line of credit will be extended or renewed  we believe that we can obtain an extension or renewal on reasonable terms 
our advances cannot exceed of eligible domestic accounts receivable and of eligible foreign insured accounts 
outstanding balance under the line of credit bears interest on a monthly basis at either wells fargo s prime rate at march  or at the london inter bank offering rate libor plus libor was at march   the interest rate is either floating at wells fargo prime rate or is at libor plus for a fixed amount drawn down 
our outstanding balance at march  was approximately million 
in addition to reporting and other non financial covenants  the line of credit contains certain financial covenants which  among other items  require us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million a quick ratio of not less than to  a debt to tangible net worth ratio of not greater than to  a pre tax profit of not less than on a rolling four quarter basis  and net income after taxes of not less than on an annual basis 
we believe that we complied with these covenants at march  our bank line of credit is based upon eligible accounts receivable 
for the years ended december   and amounts advanced against our then existing line of credit were approximately   and  million  respectively 
our credit lines have been important parts of growing our business  and market changes affecting accounts receivable could diminish the borrowing base of available funds 
for the years ended december   and  advances were  and  respectively  of the available borrowing base 
this current credit facility expires october year ended december  in the year ended december   cash from our lines of credit provided the capital needed to support our growth 
we borrowed million during the year ended december  and repaid million during the same period 
cash used in continuing operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million used for the year ended december  the increase in the use of cash from operations was primarily due to the increase in cash used for our increased levels of accounts receivable million which was partially offset by the increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
in addition  there was an increase in our inventory and prepaid inventory million which also contributed to the increase in cash used by continuing operations 
our discontinued operations used cash of  for the year ended december   as compared with cash provided of  for the year ended december  the combined effect of continued and discontinued operations resulted in an increase of cash used in operations to million from million in the prior year 
net cash used for investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared with  for the year ended december  the cash used for investing activities related to our increased warehouse and operational facilities expansion in florida  completed during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the difference is related to the million of proceeds received from the exercise of previously issued stock options and warrants 
in addition we increased the amount drawn down on our revolving line of credit to million at december  as compared with million at december  the increased borrowing was necessary to finance our growth and resulted in an increase of our interest expense to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  year ended december  and in the year ended december   net proceeds of million from our initial public offering provided working capital for our growth and enabled profitability from continuing operations

cash provided under this line of credit was  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million  and for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million 
the decrease in the use of cash in operations for the year ended december  is primarily due to the increase in cash provided from accounts receivable of million  compared with cash used of million during in addition  inventory increased by million from december  to december   as a result of increased sales 
inventory reserves decreased from of inventory on hand at december  to of inventory on hand at december  this decrease was a result of our continued efforts to better manage our inventory and monitor any items which could have costs reduced to create selling opportunities 
operating cash flows were also driven by our accounts payable which increased  at december  from the prior year 
the amount outstanding on our line of credit decreased million at december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in our line of credit was a direct result of the net proceeds received from our public offering  in addition our accounts payable increases were related directly to our purchases from suppliers 
days sales outstanding at december  was days as compared to days for the year ended december  days sales outstanding is a measure of the average amount of time between our invoicing of our customers and our receipt of payment for the customers

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results  and require management s judgments to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition and accrued chargebacks revenues are recognized upon shipment of the products to customers  when collection of the outstanding receivables are probable  and when the final price of the product has been determined 
the carrier has nine months from date of activation to charge back amounts previously credited to us if the customer terminates its service 
we provide an allowance for estimated returns based on our experience  which estimate is recorded as a contra asset against accounts receivable 
a provision for returns is provided in the same period in which the related commission revenue is recorded 
customer credit worthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and contract terminations and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment on a net or day basis depending on customer 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide reserves for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
customer credit worthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and sales returns  and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally nine months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant forecast for the applicable period 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding nine months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for the future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide a reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities  and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
certain of these leases contain renewal options 
rent expense under these leases was approximately  net of sublease income   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required by the above leases 
in addition  our future minimum lease requirements include obligations for the retail lease locations we have assigned to a third party  because we remain financially liable should the assignee default on the assigned leases 
there are approximately two months of lease payments in escrow that are held by a third party in the event of assignee default 
we believe these lease locations are very desirable and anticipate that  if necessary  we would be able to find a suitable tenant for these locations within two months after any default by the assignee 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total includes buildings  equipment and retail kiosks from discontinued operations recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of sfas r to fiscal years beginning on or after june  as a result  the company adopted sfas r on january  and will begin recognizing compensation cost as expense during the first quarter of for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using black scholes option pricing model  which is the same option pricing model used to estimate grant date fair value for sfas for pro forma disclosures 
based on unvested stock options currently outstanding  the effect of adopting sfas r will reduce the company s net income by approximately  in future periods  of which approximately  will be recognized in the company s net income will also be reduced by future grants of equity awards based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant

in february the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas amends sfas to narrow the scope exception for interest only and principal only strips on debt instruments to include only such strips representing rights to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest or principal cash flows 
sfas also amends sfas to allow qualifying special purpose entities to hold a passive derivative financial instrument pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is a derivative financial instrument 
generally  fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires that a derivative embedded in a host contract that does not meet the definition of a derivative be accounted for separately referred to as bifurcation under certain conditions 
that general rule notwithstanding  sfas no 
prior to amendments made to it by sfas no 
provides a broad exception for interest only and principal only strips initially resulting from the separation of rights to receive contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that itself does not contain an embedded derivative that would have been accounted for separately 
sfas amends sfas to restrict the scope exception to strips that represent rights to receive only a portion of the contractual interest cash flows or of the contractual principal cash flows of a specific debt instrument 
prior to amendments made by sfas  sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  permitted a qualifying special purpose entity spe to hold only passive derivative financial instruments pertaining to beneficial interests other than another derivative financial instrument issued or sold to parties other than the transferor

 which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities  permits at initial adoption a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights  provided the securities reclassified offset the entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or liabilities  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
the statement also describes the manner in which it should be initially applied 
the company does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding revolving line of credit 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate for the revolving line of credit is the prime rate at december  or libor plus at december  
for every increase in our bank s prime rate or libor  our interest expense would increase by  assuming the same million remained outstanding for the entire year 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that we would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
market risk a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets outside the united states  however all sales transactions and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for both our domestic and foreign sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results during  or
