as of december   we offered scheduled passenger service on over approximately flights daily to cities in states  canada and the bahamas pursuant to code share agreements with amr corp  the parent of american airlines  inc american  us airways  inc us airways  delta air lines  inc 
delta and united air lines  inc united 
currently  we provide our four partners with regional jet service  operating as us airways express  americanconnection  delta connection or united express  including service out of their hubs and focus cities in boston  chicago  columbus  fort lauderdale  indianapolis  new york  orlando  philadelphia  pittsburgh  washington  dc dulles and national and st

chautauqua airlines is our platform for flying the to seat erj family of aircraft  and as december operated aircraft 
shuttle america  which we acquired from an affiliate on may   is our platform for flying seat aircraft and as of december   operated erj aircraft 
republic airline is our platform for aircraft with more than seats 
as of december   republic airline operated ten seat erj aircraft for us airways 
in january  we and delta entered into a code share agreement whereby the company will operate erj aircraft for delta  of which were in service at december  on june   the company amended its code share agreements with united  increasing the erj fleet from to aircraft and reducing the erj fleet from nine to seven aircraft 
the five additional erj aircraft were all placed into service by december  the two erj aircraft were removed from service and added to the company s charter operations beginning in november  on march   we and wexford capital llc entered into an investment agreement with us airways group  inc and us airways 
the agreement included provisions for the affirmation of an amended chautauqua code share agreement  a new jet service agreement for the operation of erj and erj aircraft  a conditional  equity commitment and up to  in asset related financing 
the bankruptcy court approved the agreement on march  on september   we and us airways entered into a global aircraft transaction agreement 
under this agreement  we purchased erj aircraft owned by us airways 
we leased the purchased aircraft back to us airways subject to their transfer to republic airline under a year fixed fee jet service agreement we entered into with us airways on september  as of december   seven of these aircraft had been transferred to republic airline 
we also agreed to assume the leases of additional erj aircraft operated by us airways and to enter into new leases for an additional three erj aircraft 
all aircraft are expected to be in operation with republic airline by september in addition  under a commuter slot option agreement that we and us airways entered into on september   we purchased commuter slots at ronald reagan washington national airport and commuter slots at new york laguardia airport 
republic assigned the right of use for these commuter slots to us airways and these commuter slots are being operated by us airways and us airways express carriers under a licensing agreement for which us airways pays us rent 
prior to the expiration of the agreement to license the commuter slots  us airways has the right to repurchase all  but not less than all  of the washington and laguardia commuter slots at a predetermined price 
from to  our available seat miles  or asms  grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 
as of december   our operational fleet consisted of aircraft  including erj  seat and larger regional jets and erj family  seat regional jets 
further  as of december   and in addition to the regional jets which we will obtain from us airways  we have agreed to place into service an additional seven seat regional jets for delta through these seven seat regional jets are covered by firm orders we have with embraer 
we also had four firm orders and options for regional jets as of december   which we may convert to options for erj  erj or erj aircraft which range in size from seats to seats 
we have long term  fixed fee regional jet code share agreements with each of our partners that are subject to our maintaining specified performance levels 
pursuant to these fixed fee agreements  which provide for minimum aircraft utilization at fixed rates  we are authorized to use our partners two letter flight designation codes to identify our flights and fares in our partners computer reservation systems  to paint our aircraft in the style of our partners  to use their service marks and to market ourselves as a carrier for our partners 
in addition  in connection with a marketing agreement among delta  continental airlines and northwest airlines  certain of the routes that we fly using delta s flight designator code are also flown under continental s or northwest s designator codes 
our shift from pro rate revenue sharing agreements to fixed fee agreements has eliminated our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  us airways accounted for approximately and of our passenger revenues  delta accounted for approximately and of our passenger revenues  american accounted for approximately and of our passenger revenues and united accounted for approximately and of our passenger revenues 
we have a long operating history as a regional airline  having operated as a code share partner of us airways or its predecessors for more than years 
we became a twa code share partner in april  which became a code share relationship with american following its acquisition of twa  an america west code share partner in august until june  a delta code share partner in june and a united code share partner in february we have worked proactively with our code share partners to adapt to the new airline environment by renegotiating our code share agreements 
for example  in october  in exchange for agreeing to extend the date of their early termination right  we granted american certain economic concessions in the form of a monthly rebate 
in december  in exchange for  among other things  delta extending the term of its code share agreement and canceling previously issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  we agreed to reduce our compensation level on the erj fleet by for the remainder of the term of the agreement 
we also agreed to amend our code share agreement with us airways in by amending the existing chautauqua jet service agreement to provide for  among other things  the operation of regional jets at a reduced cost to us airways  us airways right to terminate from service up to five seat aircraft  and in other circumstances up to regional jet aircraft  but not in excess of more than two aircraft in any calendar month  chautauqua s right to terminate from service a specified number of regional jet aircraft not to exceed fifteen seat aircraft  and a one year extension of the agreement to march in no event is the number of seat aircraft permitted to fall below without our consent 
we also received a new jet service agreement with us airways for the operation of erj aircraft 
code share agreements on september   us airways  which represented of our revenue for the year ended december   filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy protection 
we have been paid for all amounts due post petition in accordance with our code share agreement 
in october  us airways emerged from bankruptcy 
we received  shares of us airways common stock for our pre petition claims 
the fair value of the shares as of december  was  united  which represented of our passenger revenues for the year ended december   emerged from bankruptcy on february  delta  which represented of our passenger revenues for the year ended december   is attempting to reorganize its respective businesses under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
we continue to operate normal flight schedules for delta  however  contingency plans have been developed to address potential outcomes of the delta bankruptcy proceedings 
termination of any of our regional jet code share agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
fleet transition and growth the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated december  total owned leased total owned leased total owned leased regional jets embraer erj lr embraer erj lr embraer erj lr embraer erj lr turboprops saab total two of these aircraft are used for charter at december  and two of these aircraft are used for charter and as spares at december  excludes two  one and five saab aircraft held for sale at december   and  respectively 
we recorded impairment losses and accrued aircraft return cost of and million in and  respectively 
the impairment losses reduced the carrying value of the owned saab aircraft to be disposed of to the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the impairment losses were based on the estimated fair values obtained from aircraft dealers  less selling costs 
the accrued aircraft return costs represented the estimate of the company s overhaul and return costs in order to meet required return conditions 
in december  we reversed a million reserve for estimated return costs after the saab turboprops were returned to lessors and all liabilities were settled

there were embraer regional jets operating under the agreement with american at december   and at december   and  respectively  we had  and aircraft in operation under our agreements with delta 
we began flying embraer regional jets and saab turboprops for united in june and at december  and respectively  we had and embraer regional jets in operation under the agreement with united

during  of our asms and of our passenger revenues were generated under fixed fee agreements 
during  of our asms and of our passenger revenues were generated under fixed fee agreements 
during  of our asms and passenger revenues were generated under fixed fee agreements 
the shift to fixed fee flying has reduced our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
as of december   we operated embraer regional jets for four code share partners under fixed fee agreements 
revenue under our fixed fee arrangements with american  delta  us airways and united for regional jets  we receive a fixed fee  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior performance 
under our previous pro rate revenue sharing agreement with us airways for turboprop aircraft  we received a negotiated portion of ticket revenue 
as of december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our passenger revenue was earned under our fixed fee arrangements 
because all of our passenger revenue is now derived from these fixed fee arrangements  the number of aircraft we operate  as opposed to the number of passengers that we carry  will have the largest impact on our revenues 
operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expenses line items follows

we have substantial commitments for capital expenditures  primarily for the acquisition of new aircraft 
we intend to finance these aircraft through long term loans or lease arrangements  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so

we have commitments to obtain financing for these firm order regional jets 
these commitments are subject to customary closing conditions 
we expect to fund future capital commitments through internally generated funds  third party aircraft financings  and debt and other financings 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  cash generated from operations and anticipated third party financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we may need to raise additional funds  however  to fund more rapid expansion  principally the acquisition of additional aircraft  or meet unanticipated working capital requirements 
it is possible that future funding may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our contractual obligations and commitments at december   include the following in thousands payments due by period less than year years years over years total long term debt including interest operating leases aircraft under firm orders us airways lease obligations debt financed engine under firm orders total contractual cash obligations we have a long term maintenance agreement with an avionics equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider that has a guaranteed minimum annual flight hour requirement 
the minimum guaranteed amount based on our current operations is million per year through january we did not record a liability for this guarantee because we did not believe that our aircraft will be utilized below the minimum flight hour requirement during the term of the agreement 
we have a long term maintenance agreement with an aviation equipment manufacturer through october the agreement has a penalty payment provision if more than twenty percent of chautauqua s aircraft are removed from service based on the annual flight activity prior to the date of removal 
we did not record a liability for this penalty provision because we do not believe that more than twenty percent of their aircraft will be removed from service during the term of the agreement 
we have long term maintenance agreements based upon flight activity with engine manufacturers and maintenance providers through june we have a long term maintenance agreement for wheels and brakes through june the agreement has an early termination penalty if chautauqua removes the equipment from certain aircraft  sells or leases certain aircraft to a third party or terminates the services prior to expiration of agreement 
the maximum penalty during the two years subsequent to december  is million and is reduced every two years thereafter 
we did not record a liability for this penalty provision because we did not believe the contract would be terminated prior to the expiration date 
total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commercial commitments at december  include letters of credit totaling million expiring within one year 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairments to long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our aircraft and spare parts 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
we follow a method of expensing such amounts as incurred rather than accruing for expected costs or capitalizing and amortizing such costs 
however  maintenance and repairs for engines and airframe components under power by the hour contracts such as avionics  apus  wheels and brakes are accrued for as the aircraft are operated  therefore  amounts are expensed based upon actual hours flown 
warrants 
warrants issued to non employees are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  at fair value on the measurement date 
fair value for warrants issued to delta for which a measurement date has occurred have been determined based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument issued rather than the consideration received because we believe it is more reliably measured 
various option pricing models are available  however  we have used a model that allows continuous compounding of dividends which begins three years after the grant date and the dilutive effects of our initial public offering and the follow on offerings in option pricing models require estimates of dividend yield  a risk free rate commensurate with the warrant term  stock volatility and the expected life of the warrant 
each of these variables has been determined based upon relevant industry market data  our strategic business plan and consultation with appropriate professionals experienced in valuing similar equity instruments 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft
