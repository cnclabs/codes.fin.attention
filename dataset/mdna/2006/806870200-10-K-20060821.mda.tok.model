accordingly  actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the predictions contained herein 
results of operations overview balancer segment sales focus throughout the world on end users  rebuilders and original equipment manufacturers of grinding machines with the target geographic markets in north america  asia and europe 
combined balancer sales increased for the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  beginning in march  improving economic conditions in north america resulted in increased sales in that geographic market 
sales people  representatives and distributors throughout these geographic areas spend a large amount of time with targeted customers 
many customers in the automotive  bearing and aircraft industries refer to improved economic conditions and its impact on the machine tool industry in north america as the reason for their increased orders  although the growth rate has slowed in the last three quarters 
while those customers are optimistic regarding short term demand for balancer products  they remain uncertain as to the strength and duration of current business conditions in north america for their products which incorporate the balancer segment product line 
north american balancer sales decreased in the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  market demand in asia for the balancer segment products remains strong with that region showing a increase for the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  the european market remains soft as total balancer sales into that geographic market declined during the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  sales in all other markets increased to  in the year ended may  compared to the  for the year ended may   a increase 
the large percentage increase was predominately a result of increases in the japan and south american markets 
as with the north american market  the duration of the strong demand in asia  japan and south american markets cannot be forecasted with any certainty 
the measurement segment product line consists of both laser light scatter and dimensional sizing products 
combined measurement sales increased for the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  as noted below sales can be very cyclical in the measurement segment 
the business operations and prospects for these two product lines are summarized as follows laser light scatter products the primary target markets for measurement products have been disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers and companies and organizations involved in research efforts 
certain segments of these targeted industries have seen consolidation into very large international manufacturers 
sales totaled  for the year ended may  compared to the  for the year ended may  management and the sales staff monitor industry publications and public financial information in order to judge the potential demand for products by the targeted industries 
over the past year  this information has indicated improving demand for and sales of the products of those industries 
sales to customers in these industries can be very cyclical and therefore the impact of this recovery on sales to the company s laser light scatter products is unknown at this time 
laser light scatter products from research organizations the company continues to receive inquiries for these products and provide quotes to interested parties 
however  in the current fiscal year  no sales of these products were realized 
dimensional sizing products these products are marketed and sold into a wide array of industries 
sales totaled  for the year ended may  compared to the  for the year ended may  in fiscal  management built a sales distribution network covering all fifty states 
as a result of this action  the company experienced increasing interest and sales in these products 
during the quarter ended august   management consolidated the operations related to these products which had been located in menlo park  california into the measurement segment operations in portland  oregon 
the relocation was completed as of august  since relocation to portland  sales of these products have increased from the  reported in fiscal critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for sales to all customers  including manufacturer representatives  distributors or their third party customers  these criteria are met at the time product is shipped 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
cash equivalents and short term investments the company generally invests excess cash in money market funds and investment grade highly liquid securities 
the company considers securities that are highly liquid  readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of less than three months when purchased to be cash equivalents 
at may   short term investments are classified as available for sale 
the carrying amounts of cash equivalents and short term investments are stated at cost  which approximate fair market value because of their short maturities 
there were no related unrealized holding gains or losses at may  accounts receivable the company maintains credit limits for all customers that are developed based upon several factors  including but not limited to payment history  published credit reports and use of credit references 
on a monthly basis  management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
this review includes accounts receivable agings  other operating trends and relevant business conditions  including general economic factors  as they relate to the company s domestic and international customers 
if these analyses lead management to the conclusion that potential significant accounts are uncollectible  a reserve is provided 
inventories these assets are stated at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis 
each fiscal quarter  management utilizes various analyses based on sales forecasts  historical sales and inventory levels to ensure the current carrying value of inventory accurately reflects current and expected requirements within a reasonable timeframe 
deferred tax assets the company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined  based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws 
additionally  deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in fiscal and at november   management concluded future operations would produce sufficient earnings so that a portion of this asset could be used in future periods to reduce federal and state tax liabilities 
management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operations will produce sufficient earnings so that the deferred tax asset can be fully utilized 
intangible assets there is a periodic review of intangible and other long lived assets for impairment 
this review consists of the analysis of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time  to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
as of may   management does not believe impairment  as defined above  exists

sales in all other markets increased to  in the year ended may  compared to the  for the year ended may   a increase 
these increases were offset by decreases in the european market of 
unit sales prices of balancer products are relatively stable and therefore any increases or decreases in the dollar amount of sales between fiscal periods can generally be attributed to an increase or decrease in the number of units sold 
the balancer product sales increase in asia and other markets is attributed to expansion of the sales efforts in china and other market regions 
the decreased units sold in europe are attributed to strong european competition and weaker economic conditions in certain european markets 
the large percentage increase in other markets was predominately a result of increases in the japan and south american markets 
measurement product sales increased in the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  as sales of the company s surface measurement products increased by offset by slight decrease in dimensional sizing products of 
the sales of surface measurement products in the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  increased as they included more unit sales than in the same fiscal period in the prior year 
cost of sales for both the balancer and measurement segments increased as a percentage of sales in the year ended may  compared to the year ended may  primarily due to the product sales mix as production labor and overhead costs were relatively stable 
margins were also negatively impacted as a result of higher sales in foreign markets as a large portion of those sales are made through distributors who receive pricing net of commissions and other sales costs 
the decrease in operating expenses between fiscal and occurred primarily due to the reduction of operating expenses in the company s foreign operations resulting from the liquidation and dissolution of its the german subsidiary  schmitt europa  gmbh  effective may  the costs in the foreign operations decreased due to the reduction in sales and administration staff that occurred due to the consolidation of schmitt europa  gmbh operations into schmitt europe ltd 
the increase in operating expenses between fiscal and occurred primarily due to the higher levels of sales 
sales by schmitt europe ltd 
totaled  for the year ended may  compared to sales of  in the year ended may  approximately of the decrease was due to lower unit sales volumes with the remainder due to the changes in foreign exchange rates between the two fiscal periods 
the lower sales volumes were realized as a result of the soft sales in european markets  which were partially offset by increases in other markets primarily located in asia and south america 
net sales outside north america accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal some foreign customers purchase in their own country s currencies  thereby imposing on the company a currency risk 
of total sales in fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
to date  currency fluctuations have had minimal impact on sales 
however  significant variations in the value of the us dollar  relative to currencies of countries in which the company has significant competitors  can impact future sales 
the company does not engage in currency hedging 
in addition  the longer payment cycles of international sales can have a negative impact on liquidity 
the company believes international sales will continue to grow in future periods 
the net income for fiscal of  per fully diluted share compared to net income of  per fully diluted share and net income of  per fully diluted share in fiscal and  respectively 
net income in fiscal included a  reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance which reduced the fiscal income tax provision 
net income in fiscal included two significant items  a foreign exchange loss of  which was incurred due to the closure of the german subsidiary schmitt europa  gmbh  and  income tax benefit due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management believes the effective tax rate in future periods will reflect a normal combined state and federal rate 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from sales to end users through selling agents 
the company is dependent on the sales activities of its selling agents  and there can be no assurance these agents will continue to be successful in their efforts to market the company s products 
the company enjoys substantial repeat business from a broad base of customers  but there is no assurance these customers will continue to buy the company s products 
in fiscal years  or  sales to any single customer did not exceed of total revenues 
the company operates in highly competitive industries characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
the company s competitive advantage and future success are therefore dependent on its ability to develop new products  qualify these new products with its customers  successfully introduce these products to the marketplace on a timely basis  commence production to meet customer demands and develop new markets in the industries for its products and services 
the successful introduction of new technology and products is increasingly complex 
if the company is unable  for whatever reason  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its results of operations could be adversely impacted 
liquidity and capital resources the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at may  compared to to at may  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale short term investments totaled  as of may  compared to  at may  as of may  the company had  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  at may  as of may  the company had  in short term investments compared to at may  short term investments consisted of highly liquid a p rated commercial paper securities maturing through september during the year ended may   cash provided by operating activities amounted to  with the changes described as follows net income for the year ended may  of  plus one non cash item depreciation and amortization of  less the non cash increase in deferred tax assets of  net of a  tax benefit related to stock options 
accounts receivable generated cash as the balance decreased by  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may   a decrease 
the company generally experiences a payment cycle of days on invoices  depending on the geographic market 
management believes its credit and collection policies are effective and appropriate for the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company s collection procedures will continue to be successful  particularly with current economic conditions 
inventories decreased  to a may  balance of  compared to  at may   a decrease 
the company maintains levels of inventory sufficient to satisfy normal customer demands plus an increasing short term delivery requirement for a majority of its balancer products 
management believes its ability to provide prompt delivery gives it a competitive advantage for certain sales 
prepaid expenses decreased by  to  from a balance of  at may  with the decrease due to prepaid fees  trade show costs and various business and insurance costs 
trade accounts payable used cash as the balance decreased by  to  from a balance of  at may  primarily due to normal fluctuations in timing of payment of outstanding payable balances 
other accrued liabilities including customer deposits  commissions  payroll items and other accrued expenses increased by  to a balance of  from  at may  during the year ended may   net cash used in investing activities was  consisting of net additions to property and equipment of  and net purchases of short term investments of  net cash provided by financing activities amounted to  which consisted of repayments of long term obligations of  net of common stock issued on exercised stock options of  the following summarizes contractual obligations at may  and the effect on future liquidity and cash flows years ending may  capital lease and purchase contract operating leases total contractual obligations thereafter total management has historically responded to business challenges that had a negative impact on operations and liquidity by reducing operating expenses  developing new products and attempting to penetrate new markets for the company s products 
as a result of these efforts  results of operations and cash flow from operations have improved 
management believes its cash flows from operations  its available credit resources and its cash position will provide adequate funds on both a short term and long term basis to cover currently foreseeable debt payments  lease commitments and payments under existing and anticipated supplier agreements 
management believes that such cash flow without the raising of external funds is sufficient to finance current operations  projected capital expenditures  anticipated long term sales agreements and other expansion related contingencies during fiscal however  in the event the company fails to achieve its operating and financial goals for fiscal  management may be required to take certain actions to finance operations in that time period 
these actions could include  but are not limited to  implementation of cost cutting measures and or entering into additional borrowing arrangements collateralized by assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of may  however  the company could be exposed to interest rate risk at any time in the future and  therefore  employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s interest bearing cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company has a variable rate line of credit facility with a bank but there is no outstanding balance as of may  also  there is no other long term obligation whose interest rates are based on variable rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
therefore  at this time  the company is not subject to interest rate risk on outstanding interest bearing obligations if market interest rates fluctuate and does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company markets and sells its products worldwide and international sales have accounted for and are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of future revenue 
the company operates a subsidiary in the united kingdom and acquires certain materials and services from vendors transacted in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company s business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
for the years ended may   and  results of operations included gains losses on foreign currency translation of   and  respectively 
the foreign exchange loss in fiscal was directly attributable to the closure  liquidation and pending dissolution of the company s german subsidiary  schmitt europa  gmbh 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management chose to terminate the only two employees in that country  eliminating the need for a separate german company 
as there will be no future activity in that subsidiary  the accumulated foreign exchange loss  included in other comprehensive income on the balance sheet in prior periods  was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal the foreign exchange gains or losses in fiscal and are primarily attributable to company s united kingdom subsidiary  schmitt europe  ltd
