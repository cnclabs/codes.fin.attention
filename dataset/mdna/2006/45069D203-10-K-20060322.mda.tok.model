we make use of ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe that ebitda is a reliable and useful performance indicator for measuring the growth of our core operations 
we also evaluate the results of operations for  after excluding the charges associated with the second quarter restructuring 
we believe such an analysis allows us to monitor the trend in our core operations

restructuring and related activities 
during  we completed an in depth review of our business strategy  operational integration  and our product development efforts  and we concluded that our basic strategy could be pursued more effectively with greater concentration on our core business on site healthcare 
certain products and services  including legacy health management solutions and related software applications  were no longer essential to our integrated business model 
we therefore moved to terminate these services and related contracts  and restructured our operations to reduce costs and focus on our on site business as the platform for expanding products and services 
charges of  associated with the restructuring were incurred in the second quarter of  with a subsequent reversal of  of these charges in the third quarter of primarily due to favorable contract terminations 
the restructuring related charges consisted of  for impairment to goodwill and long lived assets   for restructuring charges  and  for customer contracts determined to be unprofitable  notwithstanding the reductions of operating expenses implemented through the restructuring 
our restructuring efforts have positively affected our financial performance during the second half of most notably  we have reduced our general and administrative expenses by  during the second half of the year 
working capital 
we rely on our senior credit facility to meet our working capital needs 
at december   we had  available under our credit facility to fund our working capital deficit of  our working capital at december  was  the decrease in our working capital is primarily attributable to increases in accrued dividends payable upon conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock to  at december  from  at december   actuarially established reserves at ghic  our captive insurer  and accrued rebates payable to our pharmacy clients 
our senior secured credit facility requires that we pay the dividends in shares of common stock 
in addition  at december  we had a net tax liability of  consisting of a current deferred tax asset of  and a long term deferred tax liability of  at december   we were in a fully reserved tax asset position  resulting in the reduction of both the current asset and long term liability  which negatively affected working capital

green hills insurance company and risk matters in  we formed green hills insurance company  a risk retention group  to self insure a portion of our professional and general liability insurance

green hills was capitalized with  of cash and a  letter of credit under our senior secured credit facility 
at december   green hills held  invested in cash equivalents in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the state of vermont 
this amount is also included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
green hills loss and loss adjustment reserves are adjusted monthly and represent management s best estimate of the then applicable ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses 
management s estimates incorporate the determinations presented in an independent actuarial report prepared for green hills 
the report is updated by the actuarial consulting firm as management determines is appropriate in its reasonable judgment  but not less frequently then annually 
during  green hills increased its reserves for reported claims and incurred but not reported losses and loss adjustment expense by  to  which is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the increase  in managements estimate  represents vigilant management of risk and a natural growth in the company s overall healthcare business 
in addition to reserves maintained by green hills  at december   we held  as a loss reserve for incurred but not reported losses and loss adjustment expense for older matters and this amount is included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
also  outside of green hills  we held a reserve for cost and settlement of reported claims of  which is included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  we purchase excess insurance to mitigate risk in excess of green hills policy limits 
operating an insurance subsidiary subjects us to the risks associated with any insurance business  which include investment risk relating to the performance of assets set aside as reserves for future claims  the uncertainty of making actuarial estimates of projected future professional liability losses  and loss adjustment expenses 
failure to make an adequate return on our investments  to maintain the principal of invested funds  or to estimate future losses and loss adjustment expenses accurately  could cause us to sustain losses 
also  maintaining the insurance subsidiary has exposed us to substantial additional regulatory requirements  with attendant risks if we fail to comply with applicable regulations

our non cash assets increased by  driven primarily by a  increase in accounts receivable reflecting growth in clients  pharmaceutical purchases and revenue  offset by a reduction of  of income tax receivable 
our liabilities which include accounts payable  accrued expenses  accrued restructuring charges  other current and long term liabilities  and deferred tax liability increased by  which includes accruals recorded in relation to our restructuring and related activities of other contributing factors to this increase were an increase in pharmaceutical sales  driving higher pharmaceutical purchases  and increases in reserves for green hills 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   which consists of  of capitalized software costs  and  of capital expenditures 
the software development costs were impaired during in association with our restructuring related activities 
the remaining amount of  relates to additional financing costs associated with amending our senior secured credit facility 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   of which  represents additional draws under our senior secured credit facility 
we use funding from our credit facility to finance our working capital requirements  which increased due to additional revenue  expenses and accounts receivable generated from increases in same site operations as well as an increase in of our overall number of facilities by  capital expenditures and development expenses 
we spent  during on restructuring related activities 
during  we amended our credit facility to finance working capital needs associated with our business growth and restructuring expenses 
the amendment  effective june  increased the aggregate amount that could borrowed under the facility to the lesser of  or the credit facility base calculation  in each case less outstanding letters of credit  waived compliance with the covenant for the ratio of the funded indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit facility  or ebitda  through december   and added covenants setting minimum ebitda targets for periods ending september  through december  as of december   the senior secured credit facility base calculation was  at that date  we had  of debt outstanding under our credit facility  which was classified as long term  and  was outstanding under a letter of credit 
consequently  we had  available to be borrowed under the credit facility at december  by contrast  our borrowing availability under the credit facility was  at december  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities excluding dividends payable on series a convertible preferred stock in shares of common stock was at december   as compared to at december  we believe that these ratios demonstrate adequate financial liquidity and we believe that availability under our credit facility and our cash and cash equivalents of  at december  which includes approximately  held at green hills will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
the minimum ebitda targets for periods ending september  through december  are period minimum ebitda july  september  july  december  july  march  last four fiscal quarters ending june  last four fiscal quarters ending september  last four fiscal quarters ending december  as of december   we were in compliance with our credit facility covenants 
future capital requirements we expect to use our future cash to fund working capital and to invest in strategic systems  sales and marketing programs  and service enhancements 
in  we anticipate spending  to  on capital expenditures 
as of june   we discontinued funding software development 
we funded  of software development in prior to our restructuring 
we cannot  however  provide assurances that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than we currently believe 
we will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which would most likely effect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
if sources of liquidity are not available or if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations during the next months  we might be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operating improvements  capital market transactions including the sale of common stock  asset sales or financing from third parties  or a combination of these options 
we cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or  if available  would have reasonable terms 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease contract obligations are not recognized as liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases less amounts reimbursed by clients from time to time  we enter into operating leases for offices and equipment leases on behalf of our clients in order to facilitate the delivery of our services at client locations 
in such cases  our clients agree to reimburse us for the expenses incurred related to these operating leases 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and applicable notes are prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the covered periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  restructuring costs  and goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
notwithstanding these efforts  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the respective amount of those estimates 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we operate in an industry that is rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of goodwill and intangible assets could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on the financial statements could be material 
during  in connection with our restructuring  we recognized impairment charges of  of which  related to goodwill recorded prior to the chd meridian healthcare acquisition in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we complete a test for impairment of goodwill and certain other intangible assets annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
insurance reserves loss and loss adjustment reserves are adjusted monthly and represent management s best estimate of the then applicable ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses 
management s estimates incorporate the determinations presented in an independent actuarial report 
the report is updated by the actuarial consulting firm as management determines is appropriate in its reasonable judgment  but not less frequently then annually 
we do not discount loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in severity and frequency 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  management believes the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate 
the estimates are reviewed and adjusted continuously as experience develops or new information becomes known  such adjustments are included in current operations 
to the extent claims are made against the policies in the future  we expect most such claims to be resolved within five years of original date of claim 
revenue recognition service revenue on site facilities 
we generate revenue from contractual client obligations for occupational health  primary care  pharmacy and corporate health services rendered on either a fixed fee or a cost plus arrangement 
for fixed fee contracts  revenue is recorded on a straight line basis as services are rendered 
for cost plus contracts  revenue is recorded as costs are incurred with the management fee component recorded as earned based on the method of calculation stipulated in the client contract 
revenue is recorded at the estimated net amount to be received from clients for services rendered 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of potential credit issues associated with amounts due from customers 
we record pass through pharmaceutical purchases on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
under our pharmacy arrangements  we provide pharmaceuticals to a client as a component of our pharmacy agreement  which typically requires us to staff and operate a pharmacy for the sole benefit of the client s employees and  in certain instances  dependents and retirees 
the substance of our pharmacy agreements in relation to pharmaceutical purchases demonstrates an agent like arrangement and points to net reporting 
our agreements stipulate that we must be reimbursed upon purchasing pharmaceuticals  and not upon dispensing  thus limiting inventory risk 
we also price pharmaceuticals on a pass through basis and mitigate credit risk through structured payment terms with our clients 
consequently  we do not have unmitigated credit risk 
cash we receive prior to the performance of services is reflected as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
service revenue personalized health management programs 
we recognize service revenue as services are rendered 
we contract with our customers to provide services for a monthly fee based on the number of employees  members or covered lives  a per call charge to our call center  or a combination thereof 
upon execution of a contract for services  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with such contract 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  we account for such fee as services are provided 
from time to time we enter into risk sharing contracts 
a risk sharing contract generally requires us to manage the health and wellness of a predetermined set of individuals for a term of three to five years 
a risk sharing contract may also provide that we are required to give credits to our client for a portion of our fees if our program does not save the client a stipulated percentage of the client s healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we maintained reserves of and  respectively  against potential future credits 
material equity transactions in  we executed equity transactions with unrelated parties in connection with the chd meridian healthcare merger and related financing 
we believe that we have valued all such transactions pursuant to applicable accounting rules and that they ultimately represent the economic substance of each transaction 
on april   we also released  shares of our common stock from escrow to former chd meridian healthcare stockholders because chd meridian healthcare s historic business achieved its ebitda target 
on april   the market value of our stock was per share 
during and   and  shares  respectively  of series a convertible preferred stock were converted into  and  shares of common stock  respectively 
we issued  and  additional shares of common stock to satisfy dividends accrued on the converted shares of series a convertible preferred stock during and  respectively 
effective june   our president and chief medical officer purchased from us  restricted shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
finally  in we issued  shares upon exercise of warrants and in we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in satisfaction of debt and upon exercise of warrants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not own any derivative instruments  but we were exposed to market risks  primarily due to changes in us interest rates 
our credit facility bears a variable interest rate  and accordingly  the fair market value of the debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have no cash flow or earnings exposure due to market interest rate changes for our fixed debt obligation
