raw material costs generally increased during the year  however  through improvements in pricing and the mix of products sold  the company was largely able to recover the raw material cost increases as well as largely offsetting the negative effects of lower customer unit demand  particularly in electronic materials and polymer additives 
raw materials cost increases were the most significant in the polymer additives  performance coatings 
table of contents and specialty plastics segments 
the company was the most successful in improving pricing and product mix in the polymer additives segment  although price mix also improved in performance coatings and specialty plastics 
demand for electronic materials was weak in the first quarter of following the weak beginning to the year  demand gradually improved through the rest of customers inventory issues  which caused a sharp decline in sales in the first quarter  abated in the following quarters

as a result of improved second quarter income in all segments except specialty plastics  including a partial recovery in the results within electronic materials  segment income increased by approximately from the first quarter to the second quarter 
segment income declined in the third quarter  and again in the fourth quarter  as lower sales  particularly in the performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments  adversely impacted income 
income from continuing operations for the year declined to million in from million in higher segment income  lower foreign currency losses and a gain on forward supply contracts were more than offset by higher expenses in connection with the accounting investigation and restatement  increased interest expense  and higher other expenses 
net income in was also lower than in due to a gain on the sale of assets in that did not recur in during the year  accounts payable declined by approximately million and led to an increase in working capital requirements  despite modest reductions in accounts receivable and inventories

based on rating agency disclosures  ferro understands that ratings changes within the general industrial sector are evaluated based on quantitative  qualitative and legal analyses 
factors considered by the rating agencies include industry characteristics  competitive position  management  financial policy  profitability  capital structure  cash flow production and financial flexibility 
moody s and s p have disclosed that the company s ability to improve earnings  reduce the company s level of indebtedness and strengthen cash flow protection measures  whether through asset sales  increased free cash flows from operations or otherwise  will be factors in their ratings determinations going forward 
revolving credit and term loan facility in march  the company accepted a commitment from a syndicate of lenders to underwrite a million credit facility the new credit facility and  in june  finalized the agreement

under the terms of the new credit facility  the company can request that the revolving credit facility be increased by million at no additional fee 
the new credit facility was entered into to replace the prior revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in september in addition  the financing  through the term loan facility  provided capital resources sufficient to refinance the million of senior notes and million of debentures that could have become immediately due and payable due to defaults associated with the company s delayed sec financial filings for because one of the purposes of the term loan facility is to fund the potential acceleration of the senior notes and debentures  the term facility contains certain restrictions including  but not limited to  the following million of the facility is reserved to repay the senior notes and debentures  million of the facility is immediately available for refunding indebtedness other than the senior notes and debentures  the company may access up to million of the million reserved to repay the senior notes and debentures if these obligations have not already been paid in full and no event of default for these obligations exists and is continuing  and 
table of contents the company may draw on the delayed draw facility for up to one year with any unused commitment under the term facility terminating on june  at the close of the new credit facility in june  the company drew million of the term loan facility to partially repay the old revolving credit facility 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the company drew down another million of the term loan facility to repay million of outstanding debentures  as bondholders accelerated payment on these obligations due to the previously mentioned sec financial reporting delays 
see further discussion under senior notes and debentures below 
the new credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including the assets and of the shares of the company s material domestic subsidiaries and of the shares of the company s first tier foreign subsidiaries  but excluding trade receivables sold pursuant to the company s accounts receivable sales programs see below 
these liens are shared with the holders of the company s senior notes  as required under the respective indenture 
the new credit facility contains customary operating covenants that limit the company s ability to engage in certain activities  including limitations on additional loans and investments  creation of additional liens  prepayments  redemptions and repurchases of debt  and mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
the company is also subject to customary financial covenants including a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
additional covenants of the new credit facility require the company to file its form k by november   and its forms q by the earlier of three months after the form k is filed or january  failure to satisfy certain of these covenants  either immediately or after a brief period allowing the company to satisfy the covenant  would result in an event of default 
if any event of default should occur and be continuing and a waiver not have been obtained  the obligations under the new credit facility may become immediately due and payable at the option of providers of more than of the credit facility commitment 
senior notes and debentures the indentures under which the senior notes and the debentures were issued contain operating covenants that limit the company s ability to engage in certain activities including limitations on consolidations  mergers  and transfers of assets  and sale and leaseback transactions 
the indentures contain cross default provisions with other debt obligations that exceed million of principal outstanding 
in addition  the terms of the indentures require  among other things  the company to file with the trustee copies of its annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q and an officers certificate relating to the company s compliance with the terms of the indenture within days after the end of its fiscal year 
the company has been in default on these reporting requirements since it delayed filing its form q for the second quarter of due to the restatement of its and first quarter results 
as the company anticipated and planned for  in march and april  the company received notices of default from a holder and the trustee of the senior notes and debentures of which million was outstanding 
the notices of default related only to reporting requirements and the related officers certificate 
under the terms of the indentures  the company had days from the notices of default to cure the deficiencies identified in the notices of default or obtain waivers  or events of default would have occurred and the holders or the trustee of the senior notes or debentures could declare the principal immediately due and payable 
at the end of these periods  the deficiencies had not been cured and waivers had not been obtained 
during july and august  the bondholders accelerated the payment of the principal amount of the debentures  of which million was outstanding  and the company financed the accelerated repayments by use of the aforementioned million term loan facility 
as of the date of this filing  the million senior notes currently remain outstanding  although they could be declared immediately due and payable at any time 
in the event the bondholders of the senior notes provide a notice of acceleration prior to the company curing the existing reporting default  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity resources  primarily through the term loan facility  to fully satisfy any potential acceleration 
in addition  the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the company at any time for the principal amount of the senior notes then outstanding plus the sum of any accrued but unpaid interest and the present value of any remaining scheduled interest payments 
the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the holders only upon a change in control of the company combined with a rating by either moody s or s p below investment grade as defined in the indenture 
currently  the rating by s p of the senior notes is below investment grade

while the company expects to maintain a satisfactory us asset securitization program to help meet the company s liquidity requirements  factors beyond the company s control such as prevailing economic  financial and market conditions may prevent the company from doing so 
under this program  certain of the company s receivables are sold to ferro finance corporation ffc  a wholly owned unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity qspe  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no

the company retains a beneficial interest in the receivables transferred to ffc or the conduits in the form of a note receivable to the extent that cash flows collected from receivables transferred exceed cash flows used by ffc to pay the commercial paper conduits 
the note receivable balance was million as of december   and million as of december  the company  on a monthly basis  measures the fair value of the retained interests using management s best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables 
actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interests 
consignment arrangements 
the company consigns  from various financial institutions  precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium  collectively metals used in the production of certain products for customers 
under these consignment arrangements  the financial institutions provide the company with metals for a specified period of one year or less in duration  for which the company pays a fee 
under these arrangements  the financial institutions own the metals  and accordingly  the company does not report these consigned materials as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet 
these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period  however  because the company has access to a number of consignment arrangements with available capacity  consignment needs can be shifted among the other participating institutions 
in certain cases  these other participating institutions may require cash deposits to provide additional collateral beyond the underlying precious metals 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the company s delays in filing consolidated financial statements  certain financial institutions began to require the company to make deposits 
the company had outstanding deposits of million and million at december   and august

liquidity ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flows 
in addition  a reduction in overall demand for the company s products  as well as the potential requirement to repay the senior notes due to the company s delayed sec filings  could adversely affect cash flows 
despite these potential constraints on cash flows  the company maintains considerable resources

the company also hedges a portion of its exposure to changes in the pricing of certain nickel and zinc commodities using derivative financial instruments 
nickel and zinc are raw materials used in the company s tile  porcelain enamel  and color and glass product lines 
the hedges are accomplished principally through swap arrangements that allow the company to fix the pricing of the commodities for future purchases

the company consigns  from various financial institutions  precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium  collectively metals used in the production of certain products for customers 
under these consignment arrangements  the financial institutions provide the company with metals for a specified period of one year or less in duration  for which the company pays a fee 
under these arrangements  the financial institutions own the metals  and accordingly  the company does not report these consigned materials as part of its inventory on its consolidated balance sheet 
these agreements are cancelable by either party at the end of each consignment period  however  because the company has access to a number of consignment arrangements with available capacity  consignment needs can be shifted among the other participating institutions 
in certain cases  these other participating institutions may require cash deposits to provide additional collateral beyond the underlying precious metals 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the company s delays in filing consolidated financial statements  certain financial institutions began to require the company to make deposits

costs of sales related to the consignment arrangements fees were million for  million for  and million for at december  and  the company had million and million troy ounces of metals primarily silver on consignment for periods of less than one year with market values of million and million  respectively 
the consignment arrangements allow for the company to replace the metals used in the manufacturing process by obtaining replacement quantities on the spot market and to charge the customer for the cost of the replacement quantities ie  the price charged to the customer is largely a pass through 
in certain circumstances  customers request at the time an order is placed  a fixed price for the metals cost pass through 
in these instances  the company will enter into a fixed price sales contract to establish the cost for the customer at the estimated future delivery date 
at the same time  the company enters into a forward purchase arrangement with a metal supplier to completely

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
environmental and other contingent liabilities the company expenses recurring costs associated with control and disposal of hazardous materials in current operations 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities  including those relating to ongoing  pending or threatened litigation  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
estimated costs are not discounted due to 
table of contents the uncertainty with respect to the timing of related payments 
the company actively monitors the status of sites  and as assessments and cleanups proceed  accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement actions  or changes in health  safety  environmental regulation  and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
as of december   the company had accrued liabilities of million for environmental remediation costs  of which million related to superfund sites 
as of december   the company had accrued liabilities of million of which million related to superfund sites 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where substantial pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amount of tax assets  liabilities and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations and expectations of future earnings 
expectations of future earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the ability to carryback losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying management s evaluation of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
however  the amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable if management s estimates of future earnings  cash flows and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets for which management believes realization is not more likely than not 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and also sponsors retiree medical benefits for a segment of its salaried and hourly work force within the us the assumptions used in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
ferro management meets with its actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
the discount rate for the us pension plans is determined based on a bond model 
using the company s projected pension cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s or s p that produce matching cash flows and selects the optimal one with the highest possible yield 
the discount rates for the non us plans are selected based on a yield curve method 
using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets  the duration of each plans liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
the resulting yield is rounded to the nearest basis points 
the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  the company considers both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the resulting expected returns are then rounded to the nearest basis points 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by the company s management and its actuaries and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 

table of contents the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for the company s pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease basis point decrease in asset return in discount rate assumption dollars in millions us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension cost associated with us pension and retiree medical purposes decreased from for to for the discount rate used to determine actuarial liabilities associated with us pension and retiree medical plans decreased from at december  to at december  the company also reduced the expected asset return assumption for the us pension plans from in to in these decreases were due to generally falling bond and equity yields during and the weighted average discount rate and expected asset return assumption for the company s non us pension plans decreased from and in to and in  respectively 
the measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measurements are september for the united states plans and december for the international plans 
amortization of unrecognized gains or losses is a component of net periodic cost 
these gains or losses result from the difference between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions 
at december   ferro s us and us pension plans  including the nonqualified retirement plan  had unrecognized losses of million  while ferro s us retiree medical plan currently had unrecognized gains of million 
these unrecognized gains and losses will be recognized in future net periodic costs 
during  the company entered into an agreement under which additional contributions above those required by local statutory law would be made into one international defined benefit plan in the event of the company s termination of participants in the plan without a transfer of the participants respective accrued benefits 
the additional contributions would be required as follows should such events occur before december  million  million  million  million  million  million  and million 
on april   the company froze retirement benefit accumulations for its largest defined benefit pension plan  which covers certain salaried and hourly employees in the united states 
the affected employees now receive benefits in the company s defined contribution plan that previously covered only us salaried employees hired after june  the new plan supports a diverse and mobile workforce with a competitive  flexible and portable retirement benefit  while lowering and providing greater predictability to the company s cost structure 
these changes do not affect current retirees or former employees 
additionally  the company limited eligibility for the retiree medical and life insurance coverage for all eligible nonunion employees 
only employees age or older with or more years of service as of december   will be eligible for post retirement medical and life insurance benefits 
moreover  these benefits will be available only to those employees who retire by december   after having advised the company of their retirement plans by march  these changes do not affect current retirees 
ferro expects its overall net periodic cost us pension  us retiree medical  and non us pension to decrease approximately million from to  primarily due to million in expense reductions relating to the aforementioned changes in the pension and retiree medical programs  offset by million in charges primarily relating to a lump sum payment to the beneficiary of its deceased former chief executive officer from the nonqualified defined benefit retirement plan 

table of contents the company expects to contribute approximately million to its us defined benefit pension plans in over the four year period from through  an additional million of contributions could be required 
these cash contribution requirements were determined based on current erisa and irs guidelines and reflect the aforementioned recent pension plan changes 
for significant non us plans  the company expects to contribute million in and an additional million over the four year period from through these funding amounts were determined based on the minimum contributions required under various applicable regulations in each respective country 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method  except for selected inventories where the last in  first out lifo method is used 
inventory valuation is periodically evaluated primarily based upon the age of the inventory  but also considers assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
as a result of the evaluation  the inventory may be written down to the lower of cost or realizable value 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
restructuring and cost reduction programs costs associated with exit and disposal activities are recognized when liabilities are incurred 
reserves are established for such activities by estimating employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
the company believes the estimates and assumptions used to calculate these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the estimates should changes be made in the nature or timing of the restructuring plans 
the company continued actions during associated with its cost reduction and integration programs 
the programs affect all businesses across the company  and generally will take no longer than twelve months to complete from the date of commencement unless certain legal or contractual restrictions on the company s ability to complete the program exist 
the company recorded million of pre tax charges during  all of which related to severance benefits for employees affected by plant closings or capacity reduction  as well as various personnel in administrative or shared service functions 
termination benefits were based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements and salary levels 
management estimated the charges based on these factors as well as projected final service dates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title has passed to it customers 
provision is made for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience and specific circumstances  as appropriate 
accounts deemed to be uncollectible or to require excessive collection costs are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer rebates are accrued over the rebate periods based upon estimated attainments of the provisions set forth in the rebate agreements and recorded as reductions of sales 
valuation of goodwill and other intangibles the company adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas no 
for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  as of july  fas no 
was adopted in its entirety as of january  and accordingly  the company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer being amortized 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method 
the company uses projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities to project future cash flows 

table of contents certain corporate expenses and assets and liabilities are allocated to the business units in this process 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  the company discounts the cash flow projections to the annual measurement date  october st 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  the company would proceed to the second step and obtain independent appraisals of its assets 
in and  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and therefore  it was not necessary to obtain independent appraisals 
assessment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use and eventual disposition is less than their recorded value 
in the event of impairment  a loss is recognized for the excess of the recorded value over fair value 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of impairment 
due to depressed conditions in the electronics industry in late and  the company specifically evaluated its electronics assets in holland 
the company also evaluated its italian tile and belgian polymer additives manufacturing assets because of sluggish market conditions in these regions 
in each situation  management concluded that the assets were not impaired

the company adopted interpretation no 
as of january   and recorded additional conditional aros of million 
at december  and  estimated liabilities for aros were million and million  respectively 
in determining the amounts recorded relating to conditional aros  the company utilizes an expected value technique whereby potential settlement dates and related probabilities are based upon management s judgment  taking into consideration the company s historical practices  current business intentions  and other relevant information 
legal obligations exist in connection with the retirement of assets at many of the company s operating facilities that would be triggered upon closure of the facilities or abandonment of existing operations 
if certain operating facilities were to be closed  for which there is no current intention to do so  changes to or settlements of the related conditional aros could significantly affect the company s results of operations and cash flows at that time 
derivative financial instruments the company employs derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options  to hedge certain anticipated transactions  firm commitments  or assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options are recognized as foreign currency transaction gains and losses

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risks is primarily limited to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and natural gas 
ferro s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its debt portfolio including obligations under the accounts receivable securitization program 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the negative effect of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs 
in managing the percentage of fixed versus variable rate debt  consideration is given to the interest rate environment and forecasted cash flows 
this policy limits exposure from rising interest rates and allows the company to benefit during periods of falling rates 
the company s interest rate exposure is generally limited to the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and amounts outstanding under its asset securitization program 
based on the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at december  and  a increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a million and a million corresponding change in interest expense  respectively 
for  the sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations is likely to be higher due to increased levels of variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million carrying value of fixed rate debt outstanding with an average effective interest rate of  substantially all maturing after the fair market value of these debt securities was approximately million at december  during july and august  the bondholders accelerated the payment of the principal amount of the company s fixed rate debentures  of which million was outstanding
