the following is a discussion of each of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition on product sales is not subject to significant estimates as the company has not experienced significant product returns 
the company s revenue recognition practices are not considered to involve complex estimates and judgments 
revenue is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  primarily product sales that include deployment services 
the delivered items are accounted for separately  provided that the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if we make different judgments about these arrangements  material differences in the amount of recognized product sales and services revenues could result 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 the company records revenue either based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained 
the company records revenue on a gross basis when it acts as a principal in the transaction  is the primary obligor in the arrangement  establishes prices  determines the supplier  and has credit risk 
the company records revenue on a net basis when the supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement  when the amount earned is a percentage of the total transaction value and is usually received directly from the supplier  and when the supplier has credit risk 
product sales to most customers are recorded on a gross basis as the company is responsible for fulfilling the order  establishes the selling price to the customer  has the responsibility to pay suppliers for all products ordered  regardless of when  or if  it collects from the customer  and determines the credit worthiness of its customers 
arrangements with each customer are evaluated to determine if gross or net recording is appropriate 
if we make different judgments about these arrangements  material differences in the amount of revenue recognized could result 
valuation of receivables the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers

changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
valuation of inventory the company periodically reviews inventory items and overall stocking levels to ensure that adequate reserves exist for inventory deemed obsolete or excessive 
in making this determination  the company considers historical stocking levels  recent sales of similar items and forecasted demand for these items 
changes in factors such as customer demand  technology and other matters could affect the level of inventory obsolescence in the future 
income taxes provision is made for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
in estimating deferred tax balances  the company considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accrued liabilities the company accrues for liabilities associated with disposed businesses  including amounts related to legal  environmental and contractual matters 
in connection with these matters  the recorded liabilities include an estimate of legal fees to be incurred 
these legal fees are charged against the recorded liability when incurred 
environmental matters the company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations and expected recoveries from other parties are not discounted to their present value
