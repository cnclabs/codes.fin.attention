we maintain a diversified portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located throughout the united states 
in making investments  we generally have focused on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
we have sought to diversify our investments in terms of geographic locations and operators 
in evaluating potential investments  we consider such factors as the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  the facility s historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs  capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations  providing a competitive return on our investment  the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  the geographic area of the facility  the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located  the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 
one of our fundamental investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and fixed rate mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we sometimes pursue alternative investment structures  including convertible participating and participating mortgages  which can achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the primary investment structures we typically use 
average annualized yields reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase the property from the operator and lease it back to the operator over terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by us generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi 
the average annualized yield from leases was approximately at january  convertible participating mortgage 
convertible participating mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi 
convertible participating mortgages afford us the option to convert our mortgage into direct ownership of the property  generally at a point five to ten years from inception 
if we exercise our purchase option  we are obligated to lease the property back to the operator for the balance of the originally agreed term and for the originally agreed participations in revenues or cpi adjustments 
this allows us to capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate 
the operator has the right to buy out our option at prices based on specified formulas 
at december   we did not have any convertible participating mortgages 
participating mortgage 
participating mortgages are similar to convertible participating mortgages except that we do not have a purchase option 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi 
at december   we did not have any participating mortgages 
fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was approximately at january  the following table identifies the years of expiration of the payment obligations due to us under existing contractual obligations 
this information is provided solely to indicate the scheduled expiration of payment obligations due to us and is not a forecast of expected revenues 
rent mortgage interest total in thousands thereafter total the table set forth in item properties contains information regarding our real estate properties  their geographic locations  and the types of investment structures as of december  borrowing policies 
we may incur additional indebtedness and have historically sought to maintain annualized total debt to ebitda ratio in the range of to times 
annualized ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for a twelve month period 
we intend to periodically review our policy with respect to our total debt to ebitda ratio and to modify the policy as our management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
our strategy generally has been to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
we may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness  and may obtain indebtedness which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is available on terms deemed favorable  we generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
if we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on these investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to us 
we may be required to issue additional equity interests in our company  which could dilute your investment in our company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
federal income tax considerations 
we intend to make and manage our investments  including the sale or disposition of property or other investments  and to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended internal revenue code  unless  because of changes in circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code  our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not pay federal income taxes on the portion of our taxable income which is distributed to stockholders 
policies with respect to certain activities 
if our board of directors determines that additional funding is required  we may raise such funds through additional equity offerings  debt financing  and retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income or a combination of these methods 
borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured or unsecured  and publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets  long term  tax exempt bonds or financing from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  or securitizations  any of which indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our assets 
holders of such indebtedness may have recourse to all or any part of our assets or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates 
we have authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance

item a risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
these risks are not the only ones that we may face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to the operators of our facilities our financial position could be weakened and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness could be limited if any of our major operators were unable to meet their obligations to us or failed to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire  or if we were unable to lease or re lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms 
these adverse developments could arise due to a number of factors  including those listed below 
our recent efforts to restructure and stabilize our portfolio may not prove to be successful 
in large part as a result of the changes in medicare reimbursement of services provided by snfs and reimbursement cuts imposed under state medicaid programs  a number of operators of our properties have encountered significant financial difficulties during the last several years 
in  our investment portfolio consisted of properties and our largest public operators by investment were sun healthcare group  inc sun  integrated health services ihs  advocat  inc advocat  and mariner health care  inc mariner 
some of these operators  including sun  ihs and mariner  subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection 
other of our operators were required to undertake significant restructuring efforts 
we have restructured our arrangements with many of our operators whereby we have renegotiated lease and mortgage terms  re leased properties to new operators and have closed and or disposed of properties 
at december   our investment portfolio consisted of properties and our largest public operators by investment were sun and advocat 
our largest private company operators by investment were communicare health services communicare  haven eldercare  llc haven  guardian ltc management  inc guardian  and essex healthcare corporation essex 
we cannot assure you that our recent efforts to restructure and stabilize our property portfolio will be successful 
the bankruptcy  insolvency or financial deterioration of our operators could delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators for rejected facilities 
we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations  which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment  evict an operator  demand immediate repayment and other remedies  title of the united states code  usc  as amended and supplemented  the bankruptcy code  affords certain protections to a party that has filed for bankruptcy that would probably render certain of these remedies unenforceable  or  at the very least  delay our ability to pursue such remedies 
in addition  an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent or mortgage payments during the bankruptcy case 
furthermore  the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  some significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
in order to protect our investments  we may take possession of a property or even become licensed as an operator  which might expose us to successor liability under government programs or otherwise or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses 
third party payors may also suspend payments to us following foreclosure until we receive the required licenses to operate the facilities 
should such events occur  our income and cash flow from operations would be adversely affected 
a debtor may have the right to assume or reject a lease with us under bankruptcy law and his or her decision could delay or limit our ability to collect rents thereunder 
if one or more of our lessees files bankruptcy relief  the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor has the option to assume or reject the unexpired lease within a certain period of time 
however  our lease arrangements with operators that operate more than one of our facilities are generally made pursuant to a single master lease covering all of that operator s facilities leased from us  and consequently  it is possible that in bankruptcy the debtor lessee may be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole  rather than making the decision on a facility by facility basis  thereby preventing the debtor lessee from assuming only the better performing facilities and terminating the leasing arrangement with respect to the poorer performing facilities 
the bankruptcy code generally requires that a debtor must assume or reject a contract in its entirety 
thus  a debtor cannot choose to keep the beneficial provisions of a contract while rejecting the burdensome ones  the contract must be assumed or rejected as a whole 
however  where under applicable law a contract even though it is contained in a single document is determined to be divisible or severable into different agreements  or similarly where a collection of documents are determined to constitute separate agreements instead of a single  integrated contract  then in those circumstances a debtor trustee may be allowed to assume some of the divisible or separate agreements while rejecting the others 
whether a master lease agreement would be determined to be a single contract or a divisible agreement  and hence whether a bankruptcy court would require a master lease agreement to be assumed or rejected as a whole  would depend on a number of factors some of which may include  but may not necessarily be limited to  the following applicable state law  the parties intent  whether the master lease agreement and related documents were executed contemporaneously  the nature and purpose of the relevant documents  whether the obligations in various documents are independent  whether the leases are coterminous  whether a single check is paid for all properties  whether rent is apportioned among the leases  whether termination of one lease constitutes termination of all  whether the leases may be separately assigned or sublet  whether separate consideration exists for each lease  and whether there are cross default provisions 
the bankruptcy code provides that a debtor has the power and the option to assume  assume and assign to a third party  or reject the unexpired lease 
in the event that the unexpired lease is assumed on behalf of the debtor lessee  obligations under the lease generally would be entitled to administrative priority over other unsecured pre bankruptcy claims 
if the debtor chooses to assume the lease or assume and assign the lease  then the debtor is required to cure all monetary defaults  or provide adequate assurance that it will promptly cure such defaults 
however  the debtor lessee may not have to cure historical non monetary defaults under the lease to the extent that they have not resulted in an actual pecuniary loss  but the debtor lessee must cure non monetary defaults under the lease from the time of assumption going forward 
a debtor must generally pay all rent payments coming due under the lease after the bankruptcy filing but before the assumption or rejection of the lease 
the bankruptcy code provides that the debtor lessee must make the decision regarding assumption  assignment or rejection within a certain period of time 
for cases filed on or after october   the time period to make the decision is days  subject to one extension for cause 
a bankruptcy court may only further extend this period for days unless the lessor consents in writing 
if a tenant rejects a lease under the bankruptcy code  it is deemed to be a pre petition breach of the lease  and the lessor s claim arising therefrom may be limited to any unpaid rent already due plus an amount equal to the rent reserved under the lease  without acceleration  for the greater of one year  and  not to exceed three years  of the remaining term of such lease  following the earlier of the petition date and repossession or surrender of the leased property 
if the debtor rejects the lease  the facility would be returned to us 
in that event  if we were unable to re lease the facility to a new operator on favorable terms or only after a significant delay  we could lose some or all of the associated revenue from that facility for an extended period of time 
with respect to our mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under bankruptcy law could negatively impact our ability to foreclose or seek other remedies against a mortgagor 
generally  with respect to our mortgage loans  the imposition of an automatic stay under the bankruptcy code precludes us from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the debtor without first obtaining stay relief from the bankruptcy court 
pre petition creditors generally do not have rights to the cash flows from the properties underlying the mortgages unless their security interest in the property includes such cash flows 
mortgagees may  however  receive periodic payments from the debtor mortgagors 
such payments are referred to as adequate protection payments 
the timing of adequate protection payments and whether the mortgagees are entitled to such payments depends on negotiating an acceptable settlement with the mortgagor subject to approval of the bankruptcy court or on the order of the bankruptcy court in the event a negotiated settlement cannot be achieved 
a mortgagee also is treated differently from a landlord in three key respects 
first  the mortgage loan is not subject to assumption  assumption and assignment  or rejection 
second  the mortgagee s loan may be divided into a secured claim for the portion of the mortgage debt that does not exceed the value of the property securing the debt and a general unsecured claim for the portion of the mortgage debt that exceeds the value of the property 
a secured creditor such as our company is entitled to the recovery of interest and reasonable fees  costs and charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose only if  and to the extent that  the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt  interest as well as reasonable fees  costs  and charges may not be paid during the bankruptcy case  but will accrue until confirmation of a plan of reorganization liquidation or such other time as the court orders unless the debtor voluntarily makes a payment 
if the value of the collateral held by a secured creditor is less than the secured debt including such creditor s secured debt and the secured debt of any creditor with a more senior security interest in the collateral  interest on the loan for the time period between the filing of the case and confirmation may be disallowed 
finally  while a lease generally would either be assumed  assumed and assigned  or rejected with all of its benefits and burdens intact  the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and the timing of principal payments  may be modified under certain circumstances if the debtor is able to effect a cram down under the bankruptcy code 
before such a cram down is allowed  the bankruptcy court must conclude that the treatment of the secured creditor s claim is fair and equitable 
if an operator files bankruptcy  our leases with the debtor could be recharacterized as a financing agreement  which could negatively impact our rights under the lease 
another risk regarding our leases is that in an operator s bankruptcy the leases could be re characterized as a financing agreement 
in making such a determination  a bankruptcy court may consider certain factors  which may include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following whether rent is calculated to provide a return on investment rather than to compensate the lessor for loss  use and possession of the property  whether the property is purchased specifically for the lessee s use or whether the lessee selected  inspected  contracted for  and received the property  whether the transaction is structured solely to obtain tax advantages  whether the lessee is entitled to obtain ownership of the property at the expiration of the lease  and whether any option purchase price is unrelated to the value of the land  and whether the lessee assumed many of the obligations associated with outright ownership of the property  including responsibility for property taxes and insurance 
if an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans  we may have to foreclose on the mortgage or protect our interest by acquiring title to the property and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the facility s investment potential 
operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies  seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations 
if an operator seeks bankruptcy protection  the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing foreclosure or other remedies against the operator unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case 
high loan to value ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage loan upon foreclosure 
operators that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid  licensing and certification requirements  fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may be unable to meet their obligations to us 
our operators are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted 
these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors 
the failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in particular medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of our snf operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  and failure to maintain certification and accreditation in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs 
loss of certification or accreditation could cause the revenues of our operators to decline  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in that event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced  which could in turn cause the value of our affected properties to decline 
state licensing and medicare and medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and assisted living facilities to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
federal and state agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time  and such sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
if they are unable to cure deficiencies which have been identified or which are identified in the future  such sanctions may be imposed and if imposed may adversely affect our operators revenues  potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 
licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to regulatory and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities and are periodically audited by them to confirm compliance 
failure to obtain licensure or loss or suspension of licensure would prevent a facility from operating or result in a suspension of reimbursement payments until all licensure issues have been resolved and the necessary licenses obtained or reinstated 
our snfs require governmental approval  in the form of a certificate of need that generally varies by state and is subject to change  prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
some of our facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future 
in such event  our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various extremely complex and largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the balanced budget act expanded the penalties for healthcare fraud  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs 
furthermore  the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services in cooperation with other federal and state agencies  continues to focus on the activities of snfs in certain states in which we have properties 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or medicare modernization act  which is one example of such legislation  was enacted in late the medicare reimbursement changes for the long term care industry under this act are limited to a temporary increase in the per diem amount paid to snfs for residents who have aids 
the significant expansion of other benefits for medicare beneficiaries under this act  such as the expanded prescription drug benefit  could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts for our operators 
other proposals under consideration include efforts by individual states to control costs by decreasing state medicaid reimbursements  a federal patient protection act to protect consumers in managed care plans  efforts to improve quality of care and reduce medical errors throughout the health care industry and cost containment initiatives by public and private payors 
we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on operators and  thus  our business 
regulatory proposals and rules are released on an ongoing basis that may have major impacts on the healthcare system generally and the skilled nursing and long term care industries in particular 
our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced 
changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past  and could in the future  result in a substantial reduction in our operators revenues and operating margins 
additionally  net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post payment audits 
payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional documentation is necessary or because certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary 
there also continue to be new legislative and regulatory proposals that could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers 
in some cases  states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
we cannot assure you that adequate reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators  which are currently being reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or private third party payors 
further limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations  which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and potentially jeopardize their ability to meet their obligations to us 
our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may affect their ability to pay their lease and mortgage payments to us 
as is typical in the healthcare industry  our operators are often subject to claims that their services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects 
many of these operators have experienced an increasing trend in the frequency and severity of professional liability and general liability insurance claims and litigation asserted against them 
the insurance coverage maintained by our operators may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in some states  insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation may not  in certain cases  be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability 
as a result  our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits 
we also believe that there has been  and will continue to be  an increase in governmental investigations of long term care providers  particularly in the area of medicare medicaid false claims  as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations 
insurance is not available to cover such losses 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation  whether currently asserted or arising in the future  could have a material adverse effect on an operator s financial condition 
if an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage  if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage  if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages  or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action  the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities 
increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our tenants to meet their payment obligations to us 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
we cannot be certain the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us 
our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
the market for qualified nurses  healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
this situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements 
risks related to us and our operations in addition to the operator related risks discussed above  there are a number of risks directly associated with us and our operations 
we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs  and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital  we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments 
in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  we are required  among other things  to distribute each year to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund  from cash retained from operations  all future capital needs  including capital needs to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments 
as a result  we rely on external sources of capital  including debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources  we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business  or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature  which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even  in extreme circumstances  affect our ability to continue operations 
our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including general market conditions and the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 
generally speaking  difficult capital market conditions in our industry during the past several years and our need to stabilize our portfolio have limited our access to capital 
our ability to raise capital through sales of equity is dependent  in part  on the market price of our common stock  and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to sell equity 
as with other publicly traded companies  the availability of equity capital will depend  in part  on the market price of our common stock which  in turn  will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including the extent of investor interest  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  our financial performance and that of our operators  the contents of analyst reports about us and the reit industry  general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions  our failure to maintain or increase our dividend  which is dependent  to a large part  on growth of funds from operations which in turn depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental increases  and other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in reit tax laws 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit is generally based upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing  which could negatively impact our business  limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to repay maturing debt 
financing for future investments and our maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our revolving senior secured credit facility credit facility  private or public offerings of debt  the assumption of secured indebtedness  mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risks that our cash flow will be insufficient to make timely payments of interest  that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions  our cash flow may not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions to our stockholders and to repay all maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates  changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase  which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay 
moreover  additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage 
certain of our operators account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
based on existing contractual rent and lease payments regarding the restructuring of certain existing investments  as of december   advocat and sun each account for over of our current contractual monthly revenues  with sun accounting for approximately of our current contractual monthly revenues 
additionally  as of december   our top seven operators account for approximately of our current contractual monthly revenues 
the failure or inability of any of these operators to pay their obligations to us could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to decline 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful 
for example  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties  including contingent liabilities  or newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
if we agree to provide funding to enable healthcare operators to build  expand or renovate facilities on our properties and the project is not completed  we could be forced to become involved in the development to ensure completion or we could lose the property 
these costs may negatively affect our results of operations 
our assets may be subject to impairment charges 
we periodically  but not less than annually  evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
during the year ended december   a million provision for impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value on six facilities to their estimated fair value 
we may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value 
from time to time  we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale 
to the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value  we may be required to take a non cash impairment charge or loss on the sale  either of which would reduce our net income 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
as of december   we had total debt of approximately million  of which million consisted of borrowings under our credit facility  million of which consisted of our notes due that were fully redeemed on january   million of which consisted of our senior notes due and million of which consisted of our senior notes due our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to holders of our capital stock  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  or to carry out other aspects of our business plan  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  or to carry out other aspects of our business plan  require us to pledge as collateral substantially all of our assets  require us to maintain certain debt coverage and financial ratios at specified levels  thereby reducing our financial flexibility  limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  expose us to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interests  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
all of our properties are special purpose properties that could not be readily converted to general residential  retail or office use 
healthcare facilities that participate in medicare or medicaid must meet extensive program requirements  including physical plant and operational requirements  which are revised from time to time 
such requirements may include a duty to admit medicare and medicaid patients  limiting the ability of the facility to increase its private pay census beyond certain limits 
medicare and medicaid facilities are regularly inspected to determine compliance and may be excluded from the programs in some cases without a prior hearing for failure to meet program requirements 
transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that our lessee or mortgagor becomes unable to meet its obligations on the lease or mortgage loan  the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator with a new operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
as an owner or lender with respect to real property  we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner of real property or a secured lender  such as us  may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related releases of  certain hazardous or toxic substances at  under or disposed of in connection with such property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence or disposal of such substances and liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or the assets of the owner 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  may adversely affect our operators ability to attract additional residents  the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  would reduce the owner s revenues 
although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of such obligations may be limited 
for instance  most of our leases do not require the lessee to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the lessee took possession of the premises 
further  we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
this competition may prevent us from raising prices at the same pace as our costs increase 
we compete for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other reits 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price 
if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors  the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates 
we are named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities that if decided against us  could adversely affect our financial condition 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities 
other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages  against the defendants 
the lawsuits are in various stages of discovery and we are unable to predict the likely outcome at this time 
we continue to vigorously defend these claims and pursue all rights we may have against the managers of the facilities  under the terms of the management agreements 
we have insured these matters  subject to self insured retentions of various amounts 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our defense of these matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment will be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance 
we are subject to significant anti takeover provisions 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is divided into three classes and our board members are elected for terms that are staggered 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences  rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval 
we have also adopted a stockholders rights plan which provides for share purchase rights to become exercisable at a discount if a person or group acquires more than of our common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer for more than of our common stock 
these provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  which could adversely affect the market price of our securities 
we may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure 
our board of directors  without the approval of our stockholders  may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines in the future that a change is in our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
if we fail to maintain our reit status  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we were organized to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
we believe we have conducted  and we intend to continue to conduct  our operations so as to qualify as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis  established under highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we cannot assure you that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates with respect to each such taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would significantly reduce our net earnings and cash flow because of our additional tax liability for the years involved  which could significantly impact our financial condition 
to maintain our reit status  we must distribute at least of our taxable income each year 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for the payment of our debt obligations 
in addition  we may derive income through taxable reit subsidiaries trss  which will then be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the nature and diversification of our assets  the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders 
thus we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments from our portfolio in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution eg  if we have assets which generate mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
then  having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt 
as a result  satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results and profitability 
we depend upon our key employees and may be unable to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees 
accordingly  our future success depends on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled management and other qualified personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and we compete for qualified employees with companies that may have greater financial resources than we have 
our employment agreements with our executive officers provide that their employment may be terminated by either party at any time 
consequently  we may not be successful in attracting  hiring  and training and retaining the people we need  which would seriously impede our ability to implement our business strategy 
in the event we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  or if these internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  our business could suffer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies to do a comprehensive evaluation of their internal controls 
as a result  we continue to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditor can publicly attest to this certification 
our efforts to comply with section and related regulations regarding our management s required assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment has required  and continues to require  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
if for any period our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our auditors cannot attest to management s certification  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our stock the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
the share price of our stock will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including the market for similar securities issued by reits  changes in estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts estimates  general economic and financial market conditions  and our financial condition  performance and prospects 
our issuance of additional capital stock  warrants or debt securities  whether or not convertible  may reduce the market price for our shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sale of our capital stock  warrants or debt securities  or the availability of our securities for future sale  will have on the market price of our shares  including our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares  warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following the issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock 
in addition  we may in the future issue additional options or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock under our stock incentive plan  our stock incentive plan  as amended  or other remuneration plans we establish in the future 
we may also issue options or convertible securities to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director s fees 
the issuance of shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock 
the exercise of warrants we may issue in the future 
lenders sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire shares in connection with providing financing 
we cannot assure you that our lenders will not request such rights 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in  our board of directors suspended dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock in an effort to generate cash to address then impending debt maturities 
in  we paid all accrued but unpaid dividends on all series of preferred stock and reinstated dividends on our common stock and all series of preferred stock 
however  our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if any of the risks described above were to occur 
our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our credit facility  the indenture relating to our outstanding senior notes due  the indenture relating to our outstanding senior notes due and our preferred stock 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  our dividends in the past have included  and may in the future include  a return of capital 
holders of our outstanding preferred stock have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend  liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
as of the date of this filing   shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
the aggregate liquidation preference with respect to this outstanding preferred stock is approximately million  and annual dividends on our outstanding preferred stock are approximately million 
holders of our preferred stock are generally entitled to cumulative dividends before any dividends may be declared or set aside on our common stock 
upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up  before any payment is made to holders of our common stock  holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of per share with respect to the series d preferred stock  plus any accrued and unpaid distributions 
this will reduce the remaining amount of our assets  if any  available to distribute to holders of our common stock 
in addition  holders of our preferred stock have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors if six quarterly preferred dividends are in arrears 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect purchasers of our stock 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock 
changes are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure you that any of these changes will not adversely affect our stockholder s stock 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on market value or resale potential 
stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisor with respect to the impact that recent legislation may have on their investment and the status of legislative  regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect 
recent changes in taxation of corporate dividends may adversely affect the value of our stock 
the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of that was enacted into law may   among other things  generally reduces to the maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from a regular c corporation 
this reduced tax rate  however  will not apply to dividends paid to individuals by a reit on its shares  except for certain limited amounts 
while the earnings of a reit that are distributed to its stockholders still generally will be subject to less combined federal income taxation than earnings of a non reit c corporation that are distributed to its stockholders net of corporate level tax  this legislation could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular c corporations as more attractive relative to the shares of a reit than was the case prior to the enactment of the legislation 
individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular c corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from reits will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individual s other ordinary income 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the enactment of this legislation may have on the value of the shares of reits in general or on the value of our stock in particular  either in terms of price or relative to other investments

our portfolio of properties is broadly diversified by geographic location 
we have healthcare facilities located in states 
only one state comprised more than of our rental and mortgage income in in addition  the majority of our rental and mortgage income was derived from facilities in states that require state approval for development and expansion of healthcare facilities 
we believe that such state approvals may limit competition for our operators and enhance the value of our properties

a large portion of our core portfolio consists of long term lease and mortgage agreements 
at december   approximately of our leases and mortgages had primary terms that expire in or later 
our leased real estate properties are leased under provisions of single facility leases or master leases with initial terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
substantially all of the leases and master leases provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying properties  with certain limits 
under the terms of the leases  the lessee is responsible for all maintenance  repairs  taxes and insurance on the leased properties 
item legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
while any legal proceeding or claim has an element of uncertainty  management believes that the outcome of each lawsuit  claim or legal proceeding that is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries have been named as defendants in professional liability claims related to our former owned and operated facilities 
other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities have also been named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages against the defendants 
the majority of these lawsuits representing the most significant amount of exposure were settled in there currently is one lawsuit pending that is in the discovery stage  and we are unable to predict the likely outcome of this lawsuit at this time 
in  we filed suit against a former tenant seeking damages based on claims of breach of contract 
the defendants denied the allegations made in the lawsuit 
in settlement of our claim against the defendants  we agreed in the fourth quarter of to accept a lump sum cash payment of million 
the cash proceeds were offset by related expenses incurred of million  resulting in a net gain of million paid december  during the second quarter of  we accrued million for potential obligations relating to disputed capital improvement requirements associated with a lease that expired june  although no formal complaint for damages was filed against us  in february  we agreed to settle this dispute for approximately million

overview our portfolio of investments at december   consisted of healthcare facilities  located in states and operated by third party operators 
our gross investment in these facilities totaled approximately  million at december   with of our real estate investments related to long term healthcare facilities 
this portfolio is made up of long term healthcare facilities and two rehabilitation hospitals owned and leased to third parties and fixed rate mortgages on long term healthcare facilities 
at december   we also held other investments of approximately million  consisting primarily of secured loans to third party operators of our facilities 
medicare reimbursement all of our properties are used as healthcare facilities  therefore  we are directly affected by the risk associated with the healthcare industry 
our lessees and mortgagors  as well as any facilities that may be owned and operated for our own account from time to time  derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these programs are highly regulated by federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations  and subject to frequent and substantial change 
in  the balanced budget act significantly reduced spending levels for the medicare and medicaid programs  in part because the legislation modified the payment methodology for skilled nursing facilities snfs by shifting payments for services provided to medicare beneficiaries from a reasonable cost basis to a prospective payment system 
under the prospective payment system  snfs are paid on a per diem prospective case mix adjusted basis for all covered services 
implementation of the prospective payment system has affected each long term care facility to a different degree  depending upon the amount of revenue such facility derives from medicare patients 
legislation adopted in and provided for a few temporary increases to medicare payment rates  but these temporary increases have since expired 
specifically  in the balanced budget refinement act included a across the board increase of the adjusted federal per diem payment rates for all patient acuity categories known as resource utilization groups or rugs that were in effect from april through september  in  the benefits improvement and protection act included a increase in the nursing component of the case mix adjusted federal periodic payment rate  which was implemented in april and also expired october  the october  expiration of these temporary increases has had an adverse impact on the revenues of the operators of snfs and has negatively impacted some operators ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act also established temporary increases  beginning in april  to medicare payment rates to snfs that were designated to remain in place until the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented refinements to the existing rug case mix classification system to more accurately estimate the cost of non therapy ancillary services 
the balanced budget refinement act provided for a increase for rug categories until cms modified the rug case mix classification system 
the benefits improvement and protection act modified this payment increase by reducing the increase for three of the rugs to a increase and instituting an additional increase for eleven other rugs 
on august   cms published a final rule  effective october   establishing medicare payments for snfs under the prospective payment system for federal fiscal year october  to september  
the final rule modified the rug case mix classification system and added nine new categories to the system  expanding the number of rugs from to the implementation of the rug refinements triggered the expiration of the temporary payment increases of and established by the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act  respectively 
additionally  cms announced updates in the final rule to reimbursement rates for snfs in federal fiscal year based on an increase in the full market basket of 
in the august  notice  cms estimated that the increases in medicare reimbursements to snfs arising from the refinements to the prospective payment system and the market basket update under the final rule will offset the reductions stemming from the elimination of the temporary increases during federal fiscal year cms estimated that there will be an overall increase in medicare payments to snfs totaling million in fiscal year compared to nonetheless  we cannot accurately predict what effect  if any  these changes will have on our lessees and mortgagors in and beyond 
these changes to the medicare prospective payment system for snfs  including the elimination of temporary increases  could adversely impact the revenues of the operators of nursing facilities and could negatively impact the ability of some of our lessees and mortgagors to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
a temporary increase in the per diem amount paid to snfs for residents who have aids took effect on october  this temporary payment increase arises from the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of medicare modernization act 
the august notice announcing the final rule for the snf prospective payment system for fiscal year clarified that the increase will remain in effect for fiscal year  although cms also noted that the aids add on was not intended to be permanent 
a significant change enacted under the medicare modernization act is the creation of a new prescription drug benefit  medicare part d  which went into effect january  the significant expansion of benefits for medicare beneficiaries arising under the expanded prescription drug benefit could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts for our operators 
as part of this new program  the prescription drug benefits for patients who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid are being transitioned from medicaid to medicare  and many of these patients reside in long term care facilities 
the medicare program has experienced significant operational difficulties in transitioning prescription drug coverage for this population since the benefit went into effect on january   although it is unclear whether or how issues involving medicare part d might have any direct financial impacts on our operators 
on february   the president signed into law a billion budget reconciliation package called the deficit reduction act of deficit reduction act to lower the federal budget deficit 
the deficit reduction act includes net savings of billion from the medicare program over years 
the deficit reduction act contains a provision reducing payments to snfs for allowable bad debts 
currently  medicare reimburses snfs for of beneficiary bad debt arising from unpaid deductibles and coinsurance amounts 
in  cms released a proposed rule seeking to reduce bad debt reimbursement rates for certain providers  including snfs  by over a three year period 
cms never finalized its proposal 
the deficit reduction act reduces payments to snfs for allowable bad debts by effective october  for those individuals not dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
bad debt payments for the dually eligible population will remain at 
these reductions in medicare payments for bad debt could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
the deficit reduction act also contains a provision governing the therapy caps that went into place under medicare on january  the therapy caps limit the physical therapy  speech language therapy and occupation therapy services that a medicare beneficiary can receive during a calendar year 
the therapy caps were in effect for calendar year and then suspended by congress for three years 
an inflation adjusted therapy limit  per year was implemented in september of  but then once again suspended in december of by the medicare modernization act 
under the medicare modernization act  congress placed a two year moratorium on implementation of the caps  which expired at the end of the inflation adjusted therapy caps are set at  for these caps do not apply to therapy services covered under medicare part a in a snf  although the caps apply in most other instances involving patients in snfs or long term care facilities who receive therapy services covered under medicare part b 
the deficit reduction act permits exceptions in for therapy services to exceed the caps when the therapy services are deemed medically necessary by the medicare program 
the therapy caps could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
in general  we cannot be assured that federal reimbursement will remain at levels comparable to present levels or that such reimbursement will be sufficient for our lessees or mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for medicare and medicaid patients 
we also cannot be assured that there will be any future legislation to increase medicare payment rates for snfs  and if such payment rates for snfs are not increased in the future  some of our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us 
medicaid and other third party reimbursement each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state and federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit the needs and resources of their citizens 
currently  medicaid is the single largest source of financing for long term care in the united states 
rising medicaid costs and decreasing state revenues caused by recent economic conditions have prompted an increasing number of states to cut or consider reductions in medicaid funding as a means of balancing their respective state budgets 
existing and future initiatives affecting medicaid reimbursement may reduce utilization of and reimbursement for services offered by the operators of our properties 
in recent years  many states have announced actual or potential budget shortfalls  and many budget forecasts in could be similar 
as a result of these budget shortfalls  many states have announced that they are implementing or considering implementing freezes or cuts in medicaid reimbursement rates  including rates paid to snf and long term care providers  or reductions in medicaid enrollee benefits  including long term care benefits 
we cannot predict the extent to which medicaid rate freezes  cuts or benefit reductions ultimately will be adopted  the number of states that will adopt them or the impact of such adoption on our operators 
however  extensive medicaid rate cuts  freezes or benefit reductions could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity  financial condition and results of operations  which could adversely affect their ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us 
the deficit reduction act includes billion in savings from medicaid and the state children s health insurance program over years 
the deficit reduction act gives states the option to increase medicaid cost sharing and reduce medicaid benefits  accounting for an estimated billion in federal savings over five years 
the remainder of the medicaid savings under the deficit reduction act comes primarily from changes to prescription drug reimbursement billion in savings over five years and tightened policies governing asset transfers billion in savings over five years 
asset transfer policies  which determine medicaid eligibility based on whether a medicaid applicant has transferred assets for less than fair value  are more restrictive under the deficit reduction act  which extends the look back period to years  moves the start of the penalty period and makes individuals with more than  in home equity ineligible for nursing home benefits previously  the home was excluded as a countable asset for purposes of medicaid eligibility 
these changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
additional reductions in federal funding are expected for some state medicaid programs as a result of changes in the percentage rates used for determining federal assistance on a state by state basis 
legislation has been introduced in congress that would partially mitigate the reductions for some states that would experience significant reductions in federal funding  although whether congress will enact this or other legislation remains uncertain 
finally  private payors  including managed care payors  increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk of operating a healthcare facility 
efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls are expected to continue 
any changes in reimbursement policies that reduce reimbursement levels could adversely affect the revenues of our lessees and mortgagors  thereby adversely affecting those lessees and mortgagors abilities to make their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations there are various extremely complex and largely uninterpreted federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers  including criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  or failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
the federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
penalties for healthcare fraud have been increased and expanded over recent years  including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs  and the office of the inspector general for the us department of health and human services  in cooperation with other federal and state agencies  continues to focus on the activities of snfs in certain states in which we have properties 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
some states currently have statutes that are analogous to the federal false claims act 
the deficit reduction act encourages additional states to enact such legislation and encourages increased enforcement activity by permitting states to retain of any recovery for that state s medicaid program 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize that operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
legislative and regulatory developments each year  legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced or proposed in congress  state legislatures as well as by federal and state agencies that  if implemented  could result in major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
in addition  regulatory proposals and rules are released on an ongoing basis that may have major impacts on the healthcare system generally and the industries in which our operators do business 
legislative and regulatory developments can be expected to occur on an ongoing basis at the local  state and federal levels that have direct or indirect impacts on the policies governing the reimbursement levels paid to our facilities by public and private third party payors  the costs of doing business and the threshold requirements that must be met for facilities to continue operation or to expand 
the medicare modernization act  which is one example of such legislation  was enacted in december the significant expansion of other benefits for medicare beneficiaries under this act  such as the prescription drug benefit  could result in financial pressures on the medicare program that might result in future legislative and regulatory changes with impacts on our operators 
although the creation of a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries was expected to generate fiscal relief for state medicaid programs  the structure of the benefit and costs associated with its implementation may mitigate the relief for states that was anticipated 
the deficit reduction act is another example of such legislation 
the provisions in the legislation designed to create cost savings from both medicare and medicaid could diminish reimbursement for our operators under both medicare and medicaid 
cms also launched the nursing home quality initiative program in  which requires nursing homes participating in medicare to provide consumers with comparative information about the quality of care at the facility 
in the event any of our operators do not maintain the same or superior levels of quality care as their competitors  patients could choose alternate facilities  which could adversely impact our operators revenues 
in addition  the reporting of such information could lead in the future to reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters 
in late  cms began soliciting public comments regarding a demonstration to examine pay for performance approaches in the nursing home setting that would offer financial incentives for facilities to deliver high quality care 
the proposed three year demonstration could begin as early as late other proposals under consideration include efforts by individual states to control costs by decreasing state medicaid reimbursements in the current or future fiscal years and federal legislation addressing various issues  such as improving quality of care and reducing medical errors throughout the health care industry 
we cannot accurately predict whether specific proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  what effect  if any  these proposals would have on operators and  thus  our business

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the four critical accounting policies are revenue recognition with the exception of certain master leases  rental income and mortgage interest income are recognized as earned over the terms of the related master leases and mortgage notes  respectively 
such income generally includes periodic increases based on pre determined formulas ie  such as increases in the cpi as defined in the master leases and mortgage loan agreements 
reserves are taken against earned revenues from leases and mortgages when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection 
the amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected 
when collection is uncertain  lease revenues are recorded when received  after taking into account application of security deposits 
interest income on impaired mortgage loans is recognized when received after taking into account application of principal repayments and security deposits 
we recognize the minimum base rental revenue under master leases with fixed increases on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
accrued straight line rents represent the rental revenue recognized in excess of rents due under the lease agreements at the balance sheet date 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and asset impairment under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
management periodically  but not less than annually  evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators  including the evaluation of our assets useful lives 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as  but not limited to  market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are determined to be permanently less than the carrying values of the assets 
an adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the leased properties and other long lived assets for the excess of historical cost over fair value 
the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
all impairments are taken as a period cost at that time  and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties  and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively  including amounts classified within discontinued operations 
loan impairment management  periodically but not less than annually  evaluates our outstanding loans and notes receivable 
when management identifies potential loan impairment indicators  such as non payment under the loan documents  impairment of the underlying collateral  financial difficulty of the operator or other circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents  and management believes these indicators are permanent  then the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows cannot be estimated  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the loan is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
we recorded loan impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of specified real estate assets that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for disposition as defined by sfas no 
 are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
we had three assets held for sale as of december  with a combined net book value of million 
we held no assets that qualified as held for sale as of december  results of operations the following is our discussion of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity and capital resources  which should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million  over the same period in the million increase was primarily a result of new investments made throughout and  contractual interest revenue associated with the payoff of a mortgage note  re leasing and restructuring activities completed throughout and  as well as scheduled contractual increases in rents 
the increase in operating revenues from new investments was partially offset by a reduction in mortgage interest income 
detailed changes in operating revenues for the year ended december  are as follows rental income was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was due to new leases entered into throughout and  re leasing and restructuring activities and scheduled contractual increases in rents 
mortgage interest income totaled million  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease is primarily the result of normal amortization and a million loan payoff that occurred in the first quarter of miscellaneous revenue was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was due to contractual revenue owed to us as a result of a mortgage note prepayment 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of approximately million over the same period in the increase was primarily due to million non cash provision for impairment charges recorded throughout  a million lease expiration accrual recorded in and million of increased depreciation expense 
detailed changes in our operating expenses for the year ended december  are as follows our depreciation and amortization expense was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase is due to new investments placed throughout and our general and administrative expense  when excluding restricted stock amortization expense  was million  compared to million for the same period in a million provision for impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value on three facilities to their estimated fair value during the twelve months ended december  a million provision for uncollectible notes receivable 
a million lease expiration accrual relating to disputed capital improvement requirements associated with a lease that expired june  other income expense for the year ended december   our total other net expenses were million as compared to million for the same period in the significant changes are as follows our interest expense  excluding amortization of deferred costs and refinancing related interest expenses  for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period the increase of million was primarily due to higher debt on our balance sheet versus the same period in for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash charge associated with the tender and purchase of of our million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due for the year ended december   we recorded a million provision for impairment on an equity security 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we recorded the provision for impairment to write down our  share investment in sun common stock to its then current fair market value of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of refinancing related charges associated with refinancing our capital structure 
the million consists of a million exit fee paid to our old bank syndication and a million non cash deferred financing cost write off associated with the termination of our million credit facility and our million acquisition facility  and a loss of approximately million associated with the sale of an interest rate cap 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million in net cash proceeds resulting from settlement of a lawsuit filed suit filed by us against a former tenant 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million charge associated with professional liability claims made against our former owned and operated facilities 
income from discontinued operations discontinued operations relate to properties we disposed of in or are currently held for sale and are accounted for as discontinued operations under sfas no 
for the year ended december   we sold eight snfs  six alfs and acres of undeveloped land for combined cash proceeds of approximately million  net of closing costs and other expenses  resulting in a combined accounting gain of approximately million 
we had three assets held for sale as of december  with a combined net book value of million 
during the three months ended march   a million provision for impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value on two facilities  which were subsequently closed  to their estimated fair value 
during the three months ended december   a million impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value of one facility  currently under contract to be sold in the first quarter of  to its sales price 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the million realized net gain as well as the combined million impairment charge is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
funds from operations our funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  for the year ended december   was million  compared to a deficit of million  for the same period in we calculate and report ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  and  consequently  ffo is defined as net income available to common stockholders  adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue 
ffo herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other real estate investment trusts reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us 
we use ffo as one of several criteria to measure operating performance of our business 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under gaap  and ffo should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income 
in february  nareit informed its member companies that it was adopting the position of the securities and exchange commission sec with respect to asset impairment charges and would no longer recommend that impairment write downs be excluded from ffo 
in the tables included in this disclosure  we have applied this interpretation and have not excluded asset impairment charges in calculating our ffo 
as a result  our ffo may not be comparable to similar measures reported in previous disclosures 
according to nareit  there is inconsistency among nareit member companies as to the adoption of this interpretation of ffo 
therefore  a comparison of our ffo results to another company s ffo results may not be meaningful 
the following table presents our ffo results reflecting the impact of asset impairment charges the secs interpretation for the years ended december  and year ended december  net income loss available to common deduct gain from real estate dispositions elimination of non cash items included in net income loss depreciation and amortization funds from operations available to common stockholders the deduction of the gain from real estate dispositions includes the facilities classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the gain deducted includes million gain and million gain related to facilities classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and  respectively

ffo for and includes depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  related to facilities classified as discontinued operations 
taxes no provision for federal income taxes has been made since we qualify as a reit under the provisions of sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended

we are permitted to own up to of a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
currently we have two trss that are taxable as corporations and that pay federal  state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates 
these trss had net operating loss carry forwards as of december  of million 
these loss carry forwards were fully reserved with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues our operating revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million from the same period in when excluding nursing home revenues of owned and operated assets  revenues increased million 
the million increase was primarily a result of new investments made in the second and fourth quarters of  re leasing and restructuring activities completed throughout and during the first quarter of  as well as scheduled contractual increases in rents 
detailed changes in operating revenues for the year ended december  are as follows rental income was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was due to new leases entered into in april  november and december of  re leasing and restructuring activities and scheduled contractual increases in rents 
mortgage interest income totaled million  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease is primarily the result of mortgage payoffs during  the restructuring of two mortgages during and normal amortization and was partially offset by a new mortgage placed in november other investment income totaled million  a decrease of million over the same period in the primary reason for the decrease was due to the impact of the sale of our investment in a baltimore  maryland asset leased by the united states postal service usps in operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  a decrease of approximately million over the same period in when excluding nursing home expenses of owned and operated assets in  operating expenses increased million  primarily due to restricted stock amortization expense resulting from issuance of restricted stock grants in this increase was partially offset by reductions in general and administrative and legal costs 
detailed changes in our operating expenses for the year ended december  are as follows our general and administrative expense  excluding legal expenses and restricted stock expense  was million  compared to million for the same period in our legal expenses were million  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is largely attributable to a reduction of legal costs associated with our owned and operated facilities due to the releasing efforts  sales and or closures of owned and operated assets since december  our restricted stock expense was million  compared to for the same period in the increase is due to the expense associated with restricted stock awards granted during as of december   we no longer owned any facilities that were previously recovered from customers 
as a result  our nursing home expenses for owned and operated assets decreased to from million in we believe that the presentation of our revenues and expenses  excluding nursing home owned and operated assets  provides a useful measure of the operating performance of our core portfolio as a reit in view of the disposition of all of our owned and operated assets as of january  other income expense for the year ended december   our total other net expenses were million as compared to million for the same period in the significant changes are as follows our interest expense  excluding amortization of deferred costs  for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase of million was primarily due to higher debt on our balance sheet versus the same period in for the year ended december   we recorded million of refinancing related charges associated with refinancing our capital structure

liquidity we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital  including cash from operations  our existing availability under our credit facility and expected proceeds from mortgage payoffs are more than adequate to finance operations  meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service payments  preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends  and growth through acquisitions of additional properties 
the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on  ii rental and mortgage rates  iii our debt service obligations  and iv general and administrative expenses 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  especially to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   a decrease of million as compared to the balance at december  the following is a discussion of changes in cash and cash equivalents due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities net cash flow from operating activities generated million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the million increase is due primarily to i incremental revenue associated with acquisitions completed throughout and  ii one time contractual revenue associated with a mortgage note prepayment  and iii normal working capital fluctuations during the period 
investing activities net cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of million for the year ended december   as compared to an outflow of million for the same period in the increase in outflows of million was primarily due to million of incremental acquisitions completed in versus partially offset by increased proceeds received from the assets sales in as compared to financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was an inflow of million for the year ended december  as compared to an inflow of million for the same period in the change in financing cash flow was primarily a result of i a public issuance of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  ii private offerings of a combined million of senior unsecured notes and iii net borrowings on the credit facility in of million versus net repayments on the credit facility in of million 
the financial cash inflows were partially offset by i the redemption of our series b preferred stock  ii tender offer and purchase of of our notes  iii funding with the trustee the remaining of our notes  and iv payments of common and preferred dividend payments

r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  we will adopt fas no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows  risks  discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument 
the use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange 
mortgage notes receivable the fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
notes receivable the fair value of notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
borrowings under lines of credit arrangement the carrying amount approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable 
senior unsecured notes the fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available for the similar debt 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
while we currently do not engage in hedging strategies  we may engage in such strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
