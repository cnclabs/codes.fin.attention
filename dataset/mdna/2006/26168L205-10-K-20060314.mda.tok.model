item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company s operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries 
its two primary operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert each have operations in both the mh and rv segments 
at december   the company s subsidiaries operated plants in the united states and one in canada 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of recreational vehicles  including windows  doors  chassis  chassis parts  slide out mechanisms and related power units  and electric stabilizer jacks 
the company has also recently introduced leveling devices  axles  steps and bath products for rvs 
approximately percent of the company s rv product sales are used in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in  up from percent in in  the company began to focus its efforts on expanding its market share for products used in motorhomes  including slide out mechanisms and leveling devices 
since  the rv segment also manufactures specialty trailers for hauling equipment  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles 
the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for  manufactures a variety of products used in the construction of manufactured homes  and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  chassis  chassis parts  axles  tires and thermo formed bath products 
other than sales of specialty trailers  which aggregated approximately million and million in and  respectively  sales to industries other than manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes are not significant 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
industry background recreational vehicle industry the recreational vehicle industrial association rvia reported a percent increase in industry shipments of rvs  to  rvs in from  in industry shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary market  increased percent in  which includes between  and  travel trailers purchased by the federal emergency management agency fema primarily from dealers in connection with the gulf coast hurricanes in august and october similarly  analysts reported that industry wide shipments in included approximately  travel trailers purchased by fema  primarily from manufacturers of rvs  to provide emergency housing to hurricane victims in the southeastern united states 
excluding the fema units from both and  the total industry shipments would have been between a decline of percent and an increase of percent  while the increase in industry shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs would have been between percent and percent 
industry wide sales of motorhomes declined over percent in during fema also purchased approximately  emergency living units elus  which are not classified as rvs by the rvia 
most of the travel trailers and elus ordered by fema included fewer features and amenities  such as slide out mechanisms  than the travel trailers typically produced by the industry 
as a result  the company s average content for the units purchased by fema was less than the company s average content in typical travel trailers 
it is expected that many of the elus purchased by fema in and will not be resold to traditional rv consumers 
excluding the elus  which are not included in the rvia statistics  the rvia is projecting an percent decline in wholesale shipments of all types of rvs in  and a percent decline in shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
these declines reflect the purchases by fema of travel trailers directly from dealers in  which is not expected to recur in in the long term  increasing industry rv sales are expected to continue to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the population 
according to us census bureau projections  years from now there will be in excess of million more people over the age of industry growth also appears to continue to be bolstered by a preference for domestic vacations  rather than foreign travel 
in recent years  the rvia has employed an advertising campaign to attract customers in the to age group  and the number of rv s owned by those to has grown faster than all other age groups 
manufactured housing industry as a result of i limited credit availability for typical purchasers of manufactured homes  ii high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages on site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes chattel loans are loans secured only by the home which is sited on leased land  and iii unusually high repossessions of manufactured homes  industry production declined approximately percent since  to  homes in according to the manufactured housing institute mhi industry statistics  through august industry wide production of manufactured homes was about percent or  homes higher than in as in the rv industry  production levels in the mh industry increased dramatically in response to the need for emergency shelters to house victims of the gulf coast hurricanes 
for the entire year  industry production increased approximately percent  to nearly  homes  including an estimated  homes purchased by fema 
in comparison  the  homes produced by the industry in included approximately  homes purchased by fema 
excluding the homes purchased by fema in both and  industry production was essentially flat at approximately  homes 
the homes purchased by fema are not expected to be resold to traditional purchasers of manufactured homes 
as a result of the demand by fema  there was a significant shift in production in toward smaller  single section mh in which the company has substantially less product content per home 
industry analysts anticipate sales of manufactured homes could remain strong in and possibly into  as the permanent rebuilding of hurricane stricken areas creates demand for manufactured homes  including the larger multi section homes 
retail sales of manufactured homes have reportedly declined much less severely than industry production in recent years 
a significant portion of retail sales of manufactured homes in the last several years have apparently been filled by the resale of repossessed homes and reductions in inventory  rather than new production 
it has been estimated that approximately  to  manufactured homes were repossessed in each of  and  far in excess of historical repossession levels 
it has been reported that the annual level of repossessions of manufactured homes declined to between  and  homes in  with further reductions in repossessions in in addition  there are indications that the availability of financing for manufactured homes has improved 
in september  berkshire hathaway inc acquired clayton homes and oakwood homes  two of the leading producers of manufactured homes  as well as st mortgage 
since then  berkshire has helped clayton raise substantial funds for its mortgage operations 
further  the level of dealer inventory  which was relatively low prior to the hurricanes  was further depleted by the purchases by fema 
in addition  as noted above  the level of repossessions of manufactured homes has reportedly declined over the last two years 
the company believes that long term prospects for manufactured housing are favorable because manufactured homes provide quality  affordable housing 
raw material prices steel is one of the company s primary raw materials in both segments  representing about percent of the company s raw material costs 
in mid december and during  the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases 
the prices the company pays for steel remained volatile during  and depending on the type of steel purchased  are currently approximately double the levels they were at the end of in and  the company also received cost increases from suppliers of aluminum  vinyl  glass and abs resin 
to offset the impact of higher raw material costs  the company implemented surcharges and sales price increases to its customers 
the company estimates that substantially all raw material cost increases received through were passed on to customers 
these sales price increases implemented in response to rising raw material costs covered cost increases  but included little if any profit 
as a result  the company s material cost as a percent of sales has increased  particularly for products which are made primarily from steel 
the company was also notified by its suppliers of raw materials  including steel  aluminum  vinyl  glass and abs resin  of cost increases which are scheduled to go into affect during the first quarter of the company is currently analyzing the affect of these announced cost increases to determine if any sales price increases are required 
while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that future raw material cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of sales price increases 
results of operations net sales and operating profit are as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate and other other income total net sales and operating profit by segment  as a percent of the total  are as follows year ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate and other other income total operating profit margin by segment are as follows year ended december  rv segment mh segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for increased million percent from the increase in net sales in consisted of organic growth of about million  sales price increases of million  sales growth of about million due to acquisitions  and sales of components for emergency shelters purchased primarily by the federal emergency management agency fema of approximately million 
the company s rv segment outperformed the industry by achieving a million percent increase in sales to a record million in sales growth included organic growth of approximately million  sales resulting from acquisitions of million  sales price increases million  and fema related sales of approximately million 
the company s mh segment sales increased percent to million in  up from million last year 
sales growth included organic growth of approximately million  sales resulting from acquisitions of million  sales price increases million  and fema related sales of approximately million 
net income for increased percent from  greater than the percent increase in net sales due to the favorable impact on of spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base 
the negative impact on results of increases in steel costs that were not fully passed on to customers until early also  sales price increases obtained in were largely without profit margin 
these favorable factors were partially offset by start up losses in of approximately million million after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation related to new products and recently opened facilities 
the company expects to incur further start up costs during the first quarter of  although less than in the fourth quarter of during the company has increased its quality control efforts by adding dedicated quality control personnel at many of its larger manufacturing facilities 
quality control costs increased about million million after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation over on may   the company acquired the business and certain assets of venture welding venture for approximately million in cash 
venture welding had annualized sales prior to the acquisition of approximately million 
venture manufactures chassis and chassis parts for manufactured homes  modular homes and office units 
among the assets acquired are patents that will enable the company to improve its production efficiencies for chassis for manufactured homes 
during late and  drew introduced several new products for the rv and specialty trailer markets  including products for the motorhome market  a relatively new rv category for the company 
new products introduced in and included slide out mechanisms and leveling devices for motorhomes  axles for towable rvs and specialty trailers  entry steps for towable rvs  and thermo formed bath products and exterior parts for both towable rvs and motorhomes 
the company estimates that the market potential of these products is approximately million  and in the fourth quarter of  the company s sales of these products were running at an annualized rate of more than million 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in increased percent  or million  over excluding the impact of an acquisition approximately million and sales price increases approximately million  net sales of the rv segment increased percent  or approximately million  compared to a percent increase in industry wide wholesale rv shipments including the elus ordered by fema 
the company s average content for the units purchased by fema was less than the company s average content in typical travel trailers 
operating profit of the rv segment in increased percent to million due to the increase in net sales  and an increase in the operating profit margin to percent of sales in  compared to percent of sales in the operating margin in was favorably impacted by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base and lower workers compensation costs  while the operating profit margin in was negatively impacted by increases in steel costs that were not fully passed on to customers until early sales price increases obtained in and substantially offset raw material cost increases  but included little  if any  profit margin 
operating profit of the rv segment in was reduced by i start up losses of approximately million approximately million net of the related reduction in incentive compensation  ii approximately  of charges approximately  net of the related reduction in incentive compensation expenses related to a settlement offer made by the company in the action entitled steelco  vs 
lippert components  inc et al  described in part i  item legal proceedings  and iii increases in warranty and quality control costs 
the company has augmented its quality control effort to help minimize future warranty costs and maintain high customer satisfaction 
selling  general and administrative expenses of this segment increased to percent as a percent of sales in from percent in  due to increases in the provision for bad debts  administrative salaries  delivery costs and incentive compensation costs  which were only partially offset by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base 
mh segment net sales by the mh segment in increased percent  or million  over excluding the impact of acquisitions approximately million and sales price increases approximately million  net sales of the mh segment increased percent  or approximately million  compared to a percent increase in industry wide production of manufactured homes  including the fema units 
most  if not all  of the industry growth in was due to the homes purchased by fema  in which the company has substantially less product content per home since fema purchased primarily single section homes rather than multi section homes 
operating profit of the mh segment in increased percent to million due to the increase in net sales  and an increase in the operating profit margin to percent of sales in  compared to percent of sales in operating profit of this segment for and include charges of million and million  respectively million and million  respectively  net of the related reduction in incentive compensation  related to an adverse ruling in  and subsequent settlement of  the action entitled marlon harris vs 
lippert components  inc  described in part i  item legal proceedings 
excluding the impact of these litigation costs  the operating profit margin of this segment would have been approximately percent and percent for and  respectively 
the operating profit margin in was negatively impacted by increases in steel costs that were not fully passed on to customers until early  while the operating margin in was impacted favorably by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base 
sales price increases obtained in and substantially offset raw material cost increases  but included little  if any  profit margin 
results of the mh segment in were reduced by start up losses of approximately million approximately million net of the related reduction in incentive compensation and increases in warranty  overtime and quality control costs 
selling  general and administrative expense of this segment increased to percent as a percent of sales in from percent in  as higher delivery costs  administrative salaries and incentive compensation costs were only partially offset by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses for increased  compared to due largely to i increases in staff costs and travel due to the increased corporate governance requirements and compliance with section of sarbanes oxley  and ii increased incentive compensation due to increased profits 
other income in february  the company sold certain intellectual property rights relating to a process used to manufacture a new composite material 
the sale price for the intellectual property rights was million  consisting of cash of  at closing and a note of million  payable over five years 
the note was initially recorded net of a reserve of million 
in  the company received payments aggregating approximately  and recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of  in  the company received payments aggregating approximately  including interest  which had been previously fully reserved  and the company therefore recorded a gain 
the balance of the note is now million  which continues to be fully reserved 
in january  the company received a scheduled payment on the note of  including interest 
simultaneously with the sale  the company entered into an equipment lease and a license agreement with the buyer 
in march  the buyer and owner of the manufacturing process related to this intellectual property informed the company that it could not perfect the technology required for the company to produce bath products using this new composite material 
therefore  the lease for the production equipment did not become effective 
as a result  in the first quarter of  the company wrote off related capitalized project costs which had a book value of approximately  largely offsetting the gain on the collection of the note 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights on may   the company completed the acquisition of california based zieman manufacturing company zieman  a manufacturer of a variety of specialty trailers trailers for hauling equipment  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles  and chassis and chassis parts for rvs and manufactured homes  with sales of approximately million in the acquisition was immediately accretive to the company s earnings per share  adding approximately 
per share in the eight months since it was acquired 
net sales for were up percent compared to  or more than percent excluding sales price increases and the acquisition of zieman 
net income for  of million  was percent higher than in net income did not increase as rapidly as net sales for several reasons  including sales price increases did not fully offset the increases in the cost of steel and other raw material used by the company 
with additional sales price increases implemented in early  substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in have been passed on to customers 
the company did not earn any additional profit from the sales price increases which have been implemented  which caused the profit margin to decline 
the company recorded a charge of million  after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation related to an adverse jury verdict related to a workplace injury 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act were approximately million before taxes  without considering management time  which reduced net income by approximately  for during  drew s lippert subsidiary implemented plans to close six profitable  but underperforming factories 
the production at these factories will now be absorbed by nearby lippert factories 
the anticipated savings from consolidating production will more than offset the charge of   after taxes and the direct impact on incentive compensation in relating to plant closings 
net sales of the company s mh segment increased percent in  or more than percent excluding sales price increases and the acquisition of zieman  compared to  while industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes in were the same as in rv segment net sales of the rv segment increased percent to million in excluding net sales of newly acquired zieman and sales price increases approximately million  organic sales growth of this segment was approximately percent compared to  significantly greater than the percent industry wide increase in shipments of rvs this year 
the organic sales growth of the rv segment included an increase of million  or nearly percent  in sales of slide out mechanisms and related power units 
the company now has a very substantial share of the market for slide out mechanisms for towable rvs  and expects future growth in sales of its slide out products to come largely from slide out products for motorhomes  which the company began selling in the second quarter of the rv segment results for included sales by newly acquired zieman in the eight months since its acquisition of approximately million of rv chassis and chassis parts and more than million of specialty trailers 
operating results of the specialty trailers business are included in the rv segment 
the company intends to expand zieman s specialty trailer business from the west coast  where zieman now operates  to the central united states 
operating profit of the rv segment increased percent to million in the operating profit margin of this segment declined to percent of sales in  from percent last year 
the decline in the operating profit margin of the rv segment resulted largely from continued increases in the price of steel  and to a lesser extent aluminum  not all of which were passed on to customers 
further  sales price increases generally covered cost increases only  and did not include profit margin 
in addition  facility impairment and lease termination charges aggregating  were recorded in this segment in  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the increase in raw material prices aggregated approximately million in the rv segment 
in response to these cost increases  the company significantly raised its sales prices on certain of its products during and early the company believes that  on a consolidated basis  sales price increases obtained in and early are adequate to offset substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in excluding the impact of the sales price increases described above  labor and manufacturing overhead costs as a percent of sales remained stable in  compared to  as higher warranty and overtime costs offset the benefit of spreading of fixed production costs over a larger sales base 
the company has augmented its quality control effort to help minimize future warranty costs 
in  the company also increased its spending on research and development 
quality control costs and research and development costs are expected to increase further in mh segment net sales of the mh segment increased percent to million in excluding net sales by newly acquired zieman approximately million and sales price increases approximately million  organic sales growth of this segment in was approximately percent  compared to the flat industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes this year 
organic sales growth by this segment resulted primarily from market share gains 
in response to the substantial increases in the cost of steel described above  and to a lesser extent  aluminum  the company raised its sales prices on certain of its products 
the company believes that  on a consolidated basis  sales price increases obtained in and early are adequate to offset substantially all increases in raw material costs experienced in operating profit of the mh segment increased percent to million in the operating profit margin of this segment in declined to percent of sales  from percent in results of this segment for include a charge of million related to an adverse jury award related to a workplace injury 
the operating profit margin of this segment in was favorably impacted by the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base  however  this was partially offset by the inclusion of zieman s operations  which currently have lower margins than drew s other operations in the mh segment 
as of november   the company evaluated the fair value of the goodwill associated with the mh segment  which had a book value of million  and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the company will continue to monitor such goodwill in light of conditions in the mh industry 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses for increased million compared to  of which million is due to higher consulting  audit fees and other costs related to compliance with section of sarbanes oxley 
stock option expense increased approximately  and corporate office incentive compensation increased nearly  due to higher profit levels 
on a consolidated basis  stock option expense increased to  in  of which approximately  is included in segment results 
interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net  of approximately  for  was due to an increase in the average debt levels as a result of the acquisition of venture welding on may   and higher working capital levels largely due to the sales growth 
the increase in average debt levels was partially offset by savings resulting from a reduction in the average interest rate  largely due to the payoff of higher interest debt  and  of interest costs capitalized during in connection with capital projects 
interest expense  net  for remained approximately the same as in  as lower debt levels early in the year were offset by higher debt resulting from both the acquisition of zieman on may   and higher working capital levels primarily for steel inventory and accounts receivable 
on october   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap with keybank national association the interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of  from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate percent at december  based upon the november  reset date plus the company s applicable spread  and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of percent plus the company s applicable spread  with settlement and rate reset dates every november  february  may and august the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by  on each reset date 
at december   the notional amount was  the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap was  the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of certain borrowings under the credit agreement and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion  which was insignificant  recognized in earnings currently 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was approximately percent  compared to percent in and percent in the effective tax rate for gives effect to the provisions of the jobs creation act of which lowers the effective federal tax rate on manufacturing activities by up to percent  which was partially offset by the effect of a change in the composition of pre tax income for state tax purposes 
discontinued operations by january  the company s axle and tire refurbishing business had ceased operations  and is classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements pursuant to sfas no 
the proceeds from the disposition of all other significant assets of the axle and tire refurbishing business  consisting primarily of inventory and accounts receivable  were collected in january and resulted in a small gain of  net of tax expense of  recently adopted and new accounting standards in  the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options as contained in sfas no

liquidity and capital resources the statements of cash flows reflect the following in thousands year ended december  net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used for investing activities net cash flows provided by used for financing activities cash flows from operations net cash flows from operating activities increased approximately million in due to an million increase in net income as well as a a million greater increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities in  compared to the larger increase in was primarily due to i an increase in purchases of inventory during the fourth quarter of to meet fema demand  ii the strategic buying of certain raw materials ahead of announced price increases  and iii the timing of payments 
trade payables are generally paid within the discount period 
b a million smaller increase in inventories during  as compared to the larger increase in inventory in resulted from i substantial increases in the cost of steel and other raw materials used by the company  ii additional inventory requirements to meet increased sales volume  and iii the company s strategic buying of steel in advance of the numerous price increases  so that the company could postpone sales price increases to its customers for as long as possible 
the increase in inventory in resulted from i additional inventory requirements to meet increased sales volume due largely to fema related orders  seasonality and new product offerings  ii additional inventory purchased from overseas sources which requires a longer lead time  and iii the company s strategic buying of raw materials in advance of announced price increases  partially offset by a concerted effort by management to reduce inventory on hand at all locations 
on both december  and  there was less than a two week supply of finished goods on hand 
c an offset to the changes in inventory and accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from a million greater increase in accounts receivable for the increase in accounts receivable for was due largely to an increase in net sales 
days sales outstanding in receivables remained steady at approximately days  the same as in net cash flows from operating activities decreased approximately million in  despite a million increase in net income  because of a an increase of million in accounts receivable excluding receivables obtained in the acquisition of zieman on may   due largely to an increase in net sales  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in days sales outstanding to approximately days 
the increase in days sales outstanding was partly due to the timing of collections 
in addition  the accounts receivable of newly acquired zieman have a longer collection cycle 
b inventories increased million during excluding the inventory obtained in the acquisition of zieman on may   of which approximately million is due to the increase in the cost of steel and other raw materials  and million is due to the increase in unit sales excluding zieman 
inventories have also increased because of the recent introduction of several new products 
higher inventory levels are required during the initial stages of product introductions 
the inventory increase is substantially all in raw materials  as there was less than a two week supply of finished goods on hand at december  c the increase in inventory was partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities during the increase in these liabilities was less than would be expected on a million increase in inventory  because inventories declined during the fourth quarter of  so that fourth quarter purchases  and therefore year end payables  were less than would otherwise be expected 
trade payables are generally paid within the discount period

al vs 
coral construction company  et

and zieman manufacturing company  et 
al 
pending in the superior municipal court of the state of california  county of san bernardino central district case no 

plaintiff claims wrongful death damages resulting from an accident involving alleged brake failure of a ford truck that was allegedly pulling a zieman trailer 
zieman has submitted this matter to its liability insurer and is investigating the allegations in the complaint as they may relate to zieman 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales growth 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
stock options in  the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options as contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
as a result  the fair value of all employee stock options granted after january  are being charged against earnings over the period of time during which the options vest 
to determine fair value  the company uses a method known as the black scholes option pricing method 
fair value is determined as of the date the option is granted 
the fair value of options granted before january  are not being charged against earnings since the company is using the prospective method  as allowed under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
if the company had charged compensation cost of options granted prior to january  to earnings  by using the modified prospective method under sfas no 
 net income loss would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income  as reported add compensation expense related to stock options included in reported net income  net of related tax effects deduct total compensation expense related to stock options determined under fair value method for all stock option awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income net income per common share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  doubtful accounts  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
inflation the prices of raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile

the prices the company pays for steel remained volatile during  and depending on the type of steel purchased  are currently approximately double the levels they were at the end of in and  the company also received cost increases from suppliers of aluminum  vinyl  glass and abs resin 
the company was also notified by its suppliers of raw materials  including steel  aluminum  vinyl  glass and abs resin  of cost increases which are scheduled to go into affect during the first quarter of the company did not experience any significant increase in its labor costs in and related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
on october   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap with keybank national association the interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of  from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate percent at december  based upon the november  reset date plus the company s applicable spread  and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of percent plus the company s applicable spread  with settlement and rate reset dates every november  february  may and august the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by  on each reset date 
at december   the notional amount was  the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap was  the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of certain borrowings under the credit agreement and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion  which was insignificant  recognized in earnings currently 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt plus million outstanding under the interest rate swap 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be approximately  lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt  excluding the million outstanding under the interest rate swap 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be affected by  per annum 
in addition  the company is periodically exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of temporary investments in money market funds  however  such investing activity is not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above
