item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reference is made to item a 
risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  which describes important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non historical information contained herein 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of charter communications  inc and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended december   and introduction we continue to pursue opportunities to improve our liquidity 
our efforts in this regard have resulted in the completion of a number of financing transactions in and  as follows the january sale by our subsidiaries  cch ii  llc cch ii and cch ii capital corp  of an additional million principal amount of their senior notes due  the october entry by our subsidiaries  cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp  as guarantor thereunder  into a million senior bridge loan agreement with various lenders which was reduced to million as a result of the issuance of cch ii notes  the september exchange by charter holdings  cch i and cih of approximately billion in total principal amount of outstanding debt securities of charter holdings in a private placement for new debt securities  the august sale by our subsidiaries  cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp  of million of senior notes due  the march and june issuance of million of charter operating notes in exchange for million of charter holdings notes  the repurchase during of million of charter s convertible senior notes due leaving million in principal amount outstanding  and the march redemption of all of cc v holdings  llc s outstanding senior discount notes due at a total cost of million 
during the years through  we grew significantly  principally through acquisitions of other cable businesses financed by debt and  to a lesser extent  equity 
we have no current plans to pursue any significant acquisitions 
however  we may pursue exchanges of non strategic assets or divestitures  such as the sale of cable systems to atlantic broadband finance  llc 
we therefore do not believe that our historical growth rates are accurate indicators of future growth 
the industry s and our most significant operational challenges include competition from dbs providers and dsl service providers 
see item business competition 
we believe that competition from dbs has resulted in net analog video customer losses and decreased growth rates for digital video customers 
competition from dsl providers combined with limited opportunities to expand our customer base now that approximately of our analog video customers subscribe to our high speed internet services has resulted in decreased growth rates for high speed internet customers 
in the recent past  we have grown revenues by offsetting video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental advanced services such as high speed internet  video on demand  digital video recorders and high definition television 
we expect to continue to grow revenues through price increases and through continued growth in high speed internet and incremental new services including telephone  high definition television  vod and dvr service 
historically  our ability to fund operations and investing activities has depended on our continued access to credit under our credit facilities 
we expect we will continue to borrow under our credit facilities from time to time to fund cash needs 
the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities could result in borrowings from these facilities being unavailable to us and could  in the event of a payment default or acceleration  trigger events of default under our outstanding notes and would have a material adverse effect on us 
approximately million of indebtedness under our credit facilities is scheduled to mature during we expect to fund payment of such indebtedness through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
overview of operations approximately of our revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video  high speed internet  telephone and commercial services provided by our cable systems 
generally  these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time 
the remaining of revenue is derived primarily from advertising revenues  franchise fee revenues  which are collected by us but then paid to local franchising authorities  pay per view and vod programming where users are charged a fee for individual programs viewed  installation or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service  and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services 
we have increased revenues during the past three years  primarily through the sale of digital video and high speed internet services to new and existing customers and price increases on video services offset in part by dispositions of systems 
going forward  our goal is to increase revenues by offsetting video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental advanced services such as telephone  high speed internet  video on demand  digital video recorders and high definition television 
see item business sales and marketing for more details 
our success in our efforts to grow revenues and improve margins will be impacted by our ability to compete against companies with easier access to financing  greater personnel resources  greater brand name recognition  long established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers  and  often fewer regulatory burdens 
additionally  controlling our cost of operations is critical  particularly cable programming costs  which have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to increase 
see item business programming for more details 
we are attempting to control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls on expenses 
more specifically  we are focused on managing our cost structure by managing our workforce to control cost increases and improve productivity  and leveraging our size in purchasing activities 
our expenses primarily consist of operating costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense 
operating costs primarily include programming costs  the cost of our workforce  cable service related expenses  advertising sales costs  franchise fees and expenses related to customer billings 
our loss from operations decreased from billion for year ended december  to income of million for the year ended december  we had a positive operating margin defined as income loss from operations divided by revenues of and a negative operating margin of for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement from a loss from operations and negative operating margin to income from operations and positive operating margin for the year end december  is principally due to the impairment of franchises of billion recorded in the third quarter of which did not recur in for the year ended december   income from operations was million and for the year ended december   our loss from operations was billion 
we had a negative operating margin of for the year ended december   whereas for the year ending december   we had positive operating margin of 
the decline in income from operations and operating margin for the year end december  is principally due to the impairment of franchises of billion recorded in the third quarter of the year ended december  also includes a gain on the sale of certain cable systems to atlantic broadband finance  llc which is substantially offset by an increase in option compensation expense and special charges when compared to the year ended december  although we do not expect charges for impairment in the future of comparable magnitude  potential charges could occur due to changes in market conditions 
we have a history of net losses 
further  we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the interest costs we incur because of our high level of debt  the depreciation expenses that we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our cable properties  and the amortization and impairment of our franchise intangibles 
we expect that these expenses other than impairment of franchises will remain significant  and we therefore expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
historically  a portion of the losses were allocated to minority interest  however  at december   the minority interest in charter holdco was substantially eliminated by these loss allocations 
beginning in  we absorb substantially all future losses before income taxes that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest  resulting in an additional million and billion of net losses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
under our existing capital structure  future losses will continue to be absorbed by charter 
the remaining minority interest relates to cc viii and the related profit and loss allocations for the cc viii interests 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates  assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows capitalization of labor and overhead costs  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  impairment of property  plant  and equipment  franchises  and goodwill  income taxes  and litigation 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment but are not deemed critical  such as the allowance for doubtful accounts  but changes in judgment  or estimates in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements 
capitalization of labor and overhead costs 
the cable industry is capital intensive  and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending  rebuilding  and upgrading our cable network 
as of december  and  the net carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment consisting primarily of cable network assets was approximately billion representing of total assets and billion representing of total assets  respectively 
total capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were approximately billion  million and million  respectively 
costs associated with network construction  initial customer installations including initial installations of new or advanced services  installation refurbishments and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide new or advanced services are capitalized 
while our capitalization is based on specific activities  once capitalized  we track these costs by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis 
costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include materials  direct labor  and certain indirect costs overhead 
these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions 
the costs of disconnecting service at a customer s dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred  while equipment replacement and betterments  including replacement of cable drops from the pole to the dwelling  are capitalized 
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized 
we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data 
we calculate standards for items such as the labor rates  overhead rates and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity 
for example  the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities 
overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not significant in the periods presented 
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized 
we capitalize direct labor costs associated with personnel based upon the specific time devoted to network construction and customer installation activities 
capitalizable activities performed in connection with customer installations include such activities as dispatching a truck roll to the customer s dwelling for service connection  verification of serviceability to the customer s dwelling ie  determining whether the customer s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and or receiving advanced or internet services  customer premise activities performed by in house field technicians and third party contractors in connection with customer installations  installation of network equipment in connection with the installation of expanded services and equipment replacement and betterment  and verifying the integrity of the customer s network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer s digital set top terminal 
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead is incurred as a result of specific capital activities  and therefore should be capitalized 
the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are i employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor  ii direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities  consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs  iii the cost of support personnel  such as dispatch  that directly assist with capitalizable installation activities  and iv indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate  a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future 
we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies  and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies 
we capitalized internal direct labor and overhead of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and capitalized internal direct labor and overhead costs have increased in as a result of the use of more internal labor for capitalizable installations rather than third party contractors 
useful lives of property  plant and equipment 
we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment  based on annual analyses of such useful lives  and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of these analyses  which were not significant in the periods presented  will be reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed 
the effect of a one year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property  plant and equipment would be an increase in depreciation expense for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the effect of a one year increase in the weighted average useful life of our property  plant and equipment would be a decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended december  of approximately million 
depreciation expense related to property  plant and equipment totaled billion  billion and billion  representing approximately  and of costs and expenses  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line composite method over management s estimate of the estimated useful lives of the related assets as listed below cable distribution systems years customer equipment and installations years vehicles and equipment years buildings and leasehold improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years impairment of property  plant and equipment  franchises and goodwill 
as discussed above  the net carrying value of our property  plant and equipment is significant 
we also have recorded a significant amount of cost related to franchises  pursuant to which we are granted the right to operate our cable distribution network throughout our service areas 
the net carrying value of franchises as of december  and was approximately billion representing of total assets and billion representing of total assets  respectively 
furthermore  our noncurrent assets include approximately million of goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  sfas no 
requires that franchise intangible assets that meet specified indefinite life criteria no longer be amortized against earnings  but instead must be tested for impairment annually based on valuations  or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances 
in determining whether our franchises have an indefinite life  we considered the exclusivity of the franchise  the expected costs of franchise renewals  and the technological state of the associated cable systems with a view to whether or not we are in compliance with any technology upgrading requirements 
we have concluded that as of december   and more than of our franchises qualify for indefinite life treatment under sfas no 
 and that less than one percent of our franchises do not qualify for indefinite life treatment due to technological or operational factors that limit their lives 
costs of finite lived franchises  along with costs associated with franchise renewals  are amortized on a straight line basis over years  which represents management s best estimate of the average remaining useful lives of such franchises 
franchise amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that amortization expense on franchise assets will be approximately million annually for each of the next five years 
actual amortization expense in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions or divestitures  changes in useful lives and other relevant factors 
our goodwill is also deemed to have an indefinite life under sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and franchise assets which did not qualify for indefinite life treatment under sfas no 
upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises under sfas no 
 changes in technological advances  fluctuations in the fair value of such assets  adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities  adverse changes in market conditions or a deterioration of operating results 
under sfas no 
 a long lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december   or  however  approximately million of impairment on assets held for sale was recorded for the year ended december  we were also required to evaluate the recoverability of our indefinite life franchises  as well as goodwill  as of january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 and on an annual basis or more frequently as deemed necessary 
under both sfas no 
and sfas no 
 if an asset is determined to be impaired  it is required to be written down to its estimated fair market value 
we determine fair market value based on estimated discounted future cash flows  using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that are consistent with internal forecasts 
our assumptions include these and other factors penetration rates for analog and digital video  high speed internet and telephone  revenue growth rates  expected operating margins and capital expenditures 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  and such estimates include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
based on the guidance prescribed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 unit of accounting for testing of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  franchises were aggregated into essentially inseparable asset groups to conduct the valuations 
the asset groups generally represent geographic clustering of our cable systems into groups by which such systems are managed 
management believes such groupings represent the highest and best use of those assets 
our valuations  which are based on the present value of projected after tax cash flows  result in a value of property  plant and equipment  franchises  customer relationships and our total entity value 
the value of goodwill is the difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned to the other assets 
the use of different valuation assumptions or definitions of franchises or customer relationships  such as our inclusion of the value of selling additional services to our current customers within customer relationships versus franchises  could significantly impact our valuations and any resulting impairment 
franchises  for valuation purposes  are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to solicit and service potential customers customer marketing rights  and the right to deploy and market new services such as interactivity and telephone to the potential customers service marketing rights 
fair value is determined based on estimated discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent with internal forecasts 
the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated as the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained and the new services added to those customers in future periods 
the sum of the present value of the franchises after tax cash flow in years through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yields the fair value of the franchise 
prior to the adoption of eitf topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  discussed below  we followed a residual method of valuing our franchise assets  which had the effect of including goodwill with the franchise assets 
we follow the guidance of eitf issue  recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination  in valuing customer relationships 
customer relationships  for valuation purposes  represent the value of the business relationship with our existing customers and are calculated by projecting future after tax cash flows from these customers including the right to deploy and market additional services such as interactivity and telephone to these customers 
the present value of these after tax cash flows yields the fair value of the customer relationships 
substantially all our acquisitions occurred prior to january  we did not record any value associated with the customer relationship intangibles related to those acquisitions 
for acquisitions subsequent to january   we did assign a value to the customer relationship intangible  which is amortized over its estimated useful life 
in september  eitf topic d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  was issued  which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets 
we performed an impairment assessment as of september   and adopted topic d in that assessment resulting in a total franchise impairment of approximately billion 
we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million approximately million before tax effects of million and minority interest effects of million for the year ended december  representing the portion of our total franchise impairment attributable to no longer including goodwill with franchise assets 
the effect of the adoption was to increase net loss and loss per share by million and  respectively  for the year ended december  the remaining billion of the total franchise impairment was attributable to the use of lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in our valuation and was recorded as impairment of franchises in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  sustained analog video customer losses by us and our industry peers in the third quarter of primarily as a result of increased competition from dbs providers and decreased growth rates in our and our industry peers high speed internet customers in the third quarter of  in part as a result of increased competition from dsl providers  led us to lower our projected growth rates and accordingly revise our estimates of future cash flows from those used at october  see item business competition 
the valuations completed at october  and october  showed franchise values in excess of book value and thus resulted in no impairment 
the valuations used in our impairment assessments involve numerous assumptions as noted above 
while economic conditions  applicable at the time of the valuation  indicate the combination of assumptions utilized in the valuations are reasonable  as market conditions change so will the assumptions with a resulting impact on the valuation and consequently the potential impairment charge 
sensitivity analysis 
the effect on franchise values as of october  of the indicated increase decrease in the selected assumptions is shown below assumption percentage percentage point change franchise value increase decrease dollars in millions annual operating cash flow long term growth rate pts discount rate pts operating cash flow is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 
long term growth rate is the rate of cash flow growth beyond year ten 
a percentage point change of one point equates to basis points 
income taxes 
all operations are held through charter holdco and its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
charter holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not subject to income tax 
however  certain of these subsidiaries are corporations and are subject to income tax 
all of the taxable income  gains  losses  deductions and credits of charter holdco are passed through to its members charter  cii and vulcan cable iii inc charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of charter holdco allocated to it in accordance with the charter holdco limited liability company agreement llc agreement and partnership tax rules and regulations 
the llc agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net tax losses such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under the applicable federal income tax rules for determining capital accounts 
under the llc agreement  through the end of  net tax losses of charter holdco that would otherwise have been allocated to charter based generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to membership units held by vulcan cable iii inc and cii the special loss allocations to the extent of their respective capital account balances 
after  under the llc agreement  net tax losses of charter holdco are allocated to charter  vulcan cable iii inc and cii based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common units to the extent of their respective capital account balances 
allocations of net tax losses in excess of the members aggregate capital account balances are allocated under the rules governing regulatory allocations  as described below 
subject to the curative allocation provisions described below  the llc agreement further provides that  beginning at the time charter holdco generates net tax profits  the net tax profits that would otherwise have been allocated to charter based generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common membership units will instead generally be allocated to vulcan cable iii inc and cii the special profit allocations 
the special profit allocations to vulcan cable iii inc and cii will generally continue until the cumulative amount of the special profit allocations offsets the cumulative amount of the special loss allocations 
the amount and timing of the special profit allocations are subject to the potential application of  and interaction with  the curative allocation provisions described in the following paragraph 
the llc agreement generally provides that any additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the members of charter holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of charter holdco common membership units 
because the respective capital account balance of each of vulcan cable iii inc and cii was reduced to zero by december   certain net tax losses of charter holdco that were to be allocated for   and  to vulcan cable iii inc and cii instead have been allocated to charter the regulatory allocations 
as a result of the allocation of net tax losses to charter in  charter s capital account balance was reduced to zero during the llc agreement provides that once the capital account balances of all members have been reduced to zero  net tax losses are to be allocated to charter  vulcan cable iii inc and cii based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common units 
such allocations are also considered to be regulatory allocations 
the llc agreement further provides that  to the extent possible  the effect of the regulatory allocations is to be offset over time pursuant to certain curative allocation provisions the curative allocation provisions so that  after certain offsetting adjustments are made  each member s capital account balance is equal to the capital account balance such member would have had if the regulatory allocations had not been part of the llc agreement 
the cumulative amount of the actual tax losses allocated to charter as a result of the regulatory allocations through the year ended december  is approximately billion 
as a result of the special loss allocations and the regulatory allocations referred to above and their interaction with the allocations related to assets contributed to charter holdco with differences between book and tax basis  the cumulative amount of losses of charter holdco allocated to vulcan cable iii inc and cii is in excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the losses of charter holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion to their respective percentage ownership of charter holdco common membership units 
the cumulative amount of such excess losses was approximately million through december  in certain situations  the special loss allocations  special profit allocations  regulatory allocations and curative allocation provisions described above could result in charter paying taxes in an amount that is more or less than if charter holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax losses among its members based generally on the number of common membership units owned by such members 
this could occur due to differences in i the character of the allocated income eg  ordinary versus capital  ii the allocated amount and timing of tax depreciation and tax amortization expense due to the application of section c under the internal revenue code  iii the potential interaction between the special profit allocations and the curative allocation provisions  iv the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by charter  if any  v the apportionment of the allocated income or loss among the states in which charter holdco does business  and vi future federal and state tax laws 
further  in the event of new capital contributions to charter holdco  it is possible that the tax effects of the special profit allocations  special loss allocations  regulatory allocations and curative allocation provisions will change significantly pursuant to the provisions of the income tax regulations or the terms of a contribution agreement with respect to such contributions 
such change could defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by charter with respect to the net tax losses allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to charter with respect to the net tax profits allocated to it 
as a result  it is possible under certain circumstances  that charter could receive future allocations of taxable income in excess of its currently allocated tax deductions and available tax loss carryforwards 
the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below 
in addition  under their exchange agreement with charter  vulcan cable iii inc and cii may exchange some or all of their membership units in charter holdco for charter s class b common stock  be merged with charter  or be acquired by charter in a non taxable reorganization 
if such an exchange were to take place prior to the date that the special profit allocation provisions had fully offset the special loss allocations  vulcan cable iii inc and cii could elect to cause charter holdco to make the remaining special profit allocations to vulcan cable iii inc and cii immediately prior to the consummation of the exchange 
in the event vulcan cable iii inc and cii choose not to make such election or to the extent such allocations are not possible  charter would then be allocated tax profits attributable to the membership units received in such exchange pursuant to the special profit allocation provisions 
mr 
allen has generally agreed to reimburse charter for any incremental income taxes that charter would owe as a result of such an exchange and any resulting future special profit allocations to charter 
the ability of charter to utilize net operating loss carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations see item certain trends and uncertainties utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
if charter were to become subject to such limitations whether as a result of an exchange described above or otherwise  and as a result were to owe taxes resulting from the special profit allocations  then mr 
allen may not be obligated to reimburse charter for such income taxes 
as of december  and  we have recorded net deferred income tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
additionally  as of december  and  we have deferred tax assets of billion and billion  respectively  which primarily relate to financial and tax losses allocated to charter from charter holdco 
we are required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
given the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  these items have been offset with a corresponding valuation allowance of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
charter holdco is currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the tax years ending december  and our results excluding charter and our indirect corporate subsidiaries for these years are subject to this examination 
management does not expect the results of this examination to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or our liquidity  including our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
litigation 
legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty 
when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable  a reserve is established 
the reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately when the matter is brought to closure 
we have established reserves for certain matters and if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably resulting in payment obligations in excess of management s best estimate of the outcome  such resolution could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or our liquidity

the overall increase in revenues in compared to is principally the result of an increase of  and  high speed internet customers and digital video customers  respectively  as well as price increases for video and high speed internet services  and is offset partially by a decrease of  analog video customers and million of credits issued to hurricane katrina and rita impacted customers related to service outages 
we have restored service to our impacted customers 
included in the reduction in analog video customers and reducing the increase in digital video and high speed internet customers are  analog video customers   digital video customers and high speed internet customers sold in the cable system sales in texas and west virginia  which closed in july the cable system sales to atlantic broadband finance  llc  which closed in march and april and the cable system sales in texas and west virginia  which closed in july collectively referred to in this section as the systems sales reduced the increase in revenues by approximately million 
our goal is to increase revenues by improving customer service which we believe will stabilize our analog video customer base and increase the number of our customers who purchase bundled services including high speed internet  digital video and telephone services  in addition to vod  high definition television and dvr services 
in addition  we intend to increase revenues by expanding marketing of our services to our commercial customers 
average monthly revenue per analog video customer increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  primarily as a result of price increases and incremental revenues from advanced services 
average monthly revenue per analog video customer represents total annual revenue  divided by twelve  divided by the average number of analog video customers during the respective period 
revenues by service offering were as follows dollars in millions year ended december  over revenues of revenues revenues of revenues change change video high speed internet telephone advertising sales commercial other video revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services provided to our non commercial customers 
approximately million of the increase in video revenues was the result of price increases and incremental video revenues from existing customers and approximately million was the result of an increase in digital video customers 
the increases were offset by decreases of approximately million related to a decrease in analog video customers  approximately million resulting from the system sales and approximately million of credits issued to hurricanes katrina and rita impacted customers related to service outages 
approximately million of the increase in revenues from high speed internet services provided to our non commercial customers related to the increase in the average number of customers receiving high speed internet services  whereas approximately million related to the increase in average price of the service 
the increase was offset by approximately million of credits issued to hurricanes katrina and rita impacted customers related to service outages and million resulting from the system sales 
revenues from telephone services increased primarily as a result of an increase of  telephone customers in advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers  programmers and other vendors 
advertising sales revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in local advertising sales and offset by a decline in national advertising sales 
in addition  the increase was offset by a decrease of million as a result of the system sales 
for the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  in advertising sales revenues from programmers 
commercial revenues consist primarily of revenues from cable video and high speed internet services provided to our commercial customers 
commercial revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in commercial high speed internet revenues 
the increase was reduced by approximately million as a result of the system sales 
other revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees  equipment rental  customer installations  home shopping  dial up internet service  late payment fees  wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues 
for the years ended december  and  franchise fees represented approximately and  respectively  of total other revenues 
the increase in other revenues was primarily the result of an increase in franchise fees of million and installation revenue of million offset by a decrease of million in equipment rental and million in processing fees 
in addition  other revenues were offset by approximately million as a result of the system sales 
operating expenses 
the overall increase in operating expenses was reduced by approximately million as a result of the system sales 
programming costs were billion and billion  representing and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
key expense components as a percentage of revenues were as follows dollars in millions year ended december  over expenses of revenues expenses of revenues change change programming service advertising sales programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog  premium  digital channels and pay per view programming 
the increase in programming was a result of price increases  particularly in sports programming  partially offset by a decrease in analog video customers 
additionally  the increase in programming costs was reduced by million as a result of the systems sales 
programming costs were offset by the amortization of payments received from programmers in support of launches of new channels of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
programming costs for the year ended december  also include a million reduction related to the settlement of a dispute with techtv  inc  a related party 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
our cable programming costs have increased in every year we have operated in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living increases 
we expect them to continue to increase due to a variety of factors  including annual increases imposed by programmers and additional programming being provided to customers as a result of system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation  both of which increase channel capacity 
in  we expect programming costs to increase at a higher rate than in these costs will be determined in part on the outcome of programming negotiations in and will likely be subject to offsetting events or otherwise affected by factors similar to the ones mentioned in the preceding paragraph

liquidity and capital resources introduction this section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources  including a discussion of our cash position  sources and uses of cash  access to credit facilities and other financing sources  historical financing activities  cash needs  capital expenditures and outstanding debt 
overview we have a significant level of debt 
in  million of our debt matures  and in  an additional million matures 
in and beyond  significant additional amounts will become due under our remaining long term debt obligations 
recent financing transactions on january   cch ii and cch ii capital corp 
issued million in debt securities  the proceeds of which were provided  directly or indirectly  to charter operating  which used such funds to reduce borrowings  but not commitments  under the revolving portion of its credit facilities 
in october  cco holdings and cco holdings capital corp  as guarantor thereunder  entered into a senior bridge loan agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  credit suisse  cayman islands branch and deutsche bank ag cayman islands branch the lenders whereby the lenders committed to make loans to cco holdings in an aggregate amount of million 
upon the issuance of million of cch ii notes discussed above  the commitment under the bridge loan was reduced to million 
cco holdings may draw upon the facility between january  and september  and the loans will mature on the sixth anniversary of the first borrowing under the bridge loan 
in september  charter holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries  cch i and cih  completed the exchange of approximately billion total principal amount of outstanding debt securities of charter holdings in a private placement for new debt securities 
holders of charter holdings notes due in and exchanged billion principal amount of notes for billion principal amount of new cch i notes due holders of charter holdings notes due and exchanged million principal amount of notes for million principal amount of cch i notes due in addition  holders of charter holdings notes due and exchanged billion principal amount of notes for billion principal amount of various series of new cih notes 
each series of new cih notes has the same interest rate and provisions for payment of cash interest as the series of old charter holdings notes for which such cih notes were exchanged 
in addition  the maturities for each series were extended three years 
our business requires significant cash to fund debt service costs  capital expenditures and ongoing operations 
we have historically funded these requirements through cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  sales of assets  issuances of debt and equity securities and cash on hand 
however  the mix of funding sources changes from period to period 
for the year ended december   we generated million of net cash flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of billion 
in addition  the company used billion for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
finally  we had net cash flows from financing activities of million 
we expect that our mix of sources of funds will continue to change in the future based on overall needs relative to our cash flow and on the availability of funds under the credit facilities of our subsidiaries  our access to the debt and equity markets  the timing of possible asset sales and our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities 
we continue to explore asset dispositions as one of several possible actions that we could take in the future to improve our liquidity  but we do not presently consider unannounced future asset sales as a significant source of liquidity 
we expect that cash on hand  cash flows from operating activities and the amounts available under our credit facilities and bridge loan will be adequate to meet our cash needs in we believe that cash flows from operating activities and amounts available under our credit facilities and bridge loan will not be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our interest and principal repayment obligations in and beyond 
we are working with our financial advisors to address these funding requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us 
in addition  mr 
allen and his affiliates are not obligated to purchase equity from  contribute to or loan funds to us 
debt covenants our ability to operate depends upon  among other things  our continued access to capital  including credit under the charter operating credit facilities and bridge loan 
the charter operating credit facilities  along with our and our subsidiaries indentures and bridge loan  contain certain restrictive covenants  some of which require us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests and to provide audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion from our independent auditors 
as of december   we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures  bridge loan and credit facilities  and we expect to remain in compliance with those covenants for the next twelve months 
as of december   our potential availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately million  none of which was limited by covenants 
in addition  as of january  we have additional borrowing availability of million under the bridge loan which was reduced to million as a result of the issuance of the cch ii notes 
continued access to our credit facilities and bridge loan is subject to our remaining in compliance with these covenants  including covenants tied to our operating performance 
if any events of non compliance occur  funding under the credit facilities and bridge loan may not be available and defaults on some or potentially all of our debt obligations could occur 
an event of default under any of our debt instruments could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under that debt and  under certain circumstances  in cross defaults under our other debt obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
specific limitations our ability to make interest payments on our convertible senior notes  and  in and  to repay the outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes of million and million  respectively  will depend on our ability to raise additional capital and or on receipt of payments or distributions from charter holdco and its subsidiaries 
during  charter holdings distributed million to charter holdco 
as of december   charter holdco was owed million in intercompany loans from its subsidiaries  which were available to pay interest and principal on our convertible senior notes 
in addition  charter has million of governmental securities pledged as security for the next four scheduled semi annual interest payments on charter s convertible senior notes 
distributions by charter s subsidiaries to a parent company including charter  cchc and charter holdco for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under the indentures governing the cih notes  cch i notes  cch ii notes  cco holdings notes and charter operating notes unless there is no default  each applicable subsidiary s leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution and  in the case of our convertible senior notes  other specified tests are met 
for the quarter ended december   there was no default under any of these indentures and each such subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests based on december  financial results 
such distributions would be restricted  however  if any such subsidiary fails to meet these tests 
in the past  certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test 
there can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of such distribution 
distributions by charter operating and cco holdings for payment of principal on parent company notes are further restricted by the covenants in the credit facilities and bridge loan  respectively 
distributions by cih  cch i  cch ii  cco holdings and charter operating to a parent company for payment of parent company interest are permitted if there is no default under the aforementioned indentures 
however  distributions for payment of interest on our convertible senior notes are further limited to when each applicable subsidiary s leverage ratio test is met and other specified tests are met 
there can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of such distribution 
the indentures governing the charter holdings notes permit charter holdings to make distributions to charter holdco for payment of interest or principal on the convertible senior notes  only if  after giving effect to the distribution  charter holdings can incur additional debt under the leverage ratio of to  there is no default under charter holdings indentures and other specified tests are met 
for the quarter ended december   there was no default under charter holdings indentures and charter holdings met its leverage ratio test based on december  financial results 
such distributions would be restricted  however  if charter holdings fails to meet these tests 
in the past  charter holdings has from time to time failed to meet this leverage ratio test 
there can be no assurance that charter holdings will satisfy these tests at the time of such distribution 
during periods in which distributions are restricted  the indentures governing the charter holdings notes permit charter holdings and its subsidiaries to make specified investments that are not restricted payments in charter holdco or charter up to an amount determined by a formula  as long as there is no default under the indentures 
our significant amount of debt could negatively affect our ability to access additional capital in the future 
additionally  our ability to incur additional debt may be limited by the restrictive covenants in our indentures  bridge loan and credit facilities 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience liquidity problems if we do not obtain sufficient additional financing on a timely basis as our debt becomes due or because of adverse market conditions  increased competition or other unfavorable events 
if  at any time  additional capital or borrowing capacity is required beyond amounts internally generated or available under our credit facilities and bridge loan or through additional debt or equity financings  we would consider issuing equity that would significantly dilute existing shareholders  issuing convertible debt or some other securities that may have structural or other priority over our existing notes and may also significantly dilute charter s existing shareholders  further reducing our expenses and capital expenditures  which may impair our ability to increase revenue  selling assets  or requesting waivers or amendments with respect to our credit facilities  the availability and terms of which would be subject to market conditions 
if the above strategies are not successful  we could be forced to restructure our obligations or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 
in addition  if we need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or find it necessary to engage in a recapitalization or other similar transaction  our shareholders could suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might not receive principal and interest payments to which they are contractually entitled
