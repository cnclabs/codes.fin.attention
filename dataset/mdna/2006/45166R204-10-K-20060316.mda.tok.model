item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations related to future events and future financial performance that involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this document 
overview idenix is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases 
our current focus is on the treatment of infections caused by hbv  hcv  and hiv 
each of telbivudine and valtorcitabine  our product candidates for the treatment of hbv  and valopicitabine  our product candidate for the treatment of hcv  is a nucleoside or nucleoside analog that we believe may have one or more therapeutic features that will afford competitive advantages to our product candidates over currently approved therapies 
such therapeutic features may include efficacy  safety  resistance profile or convenience of dosing 
each of the product candidates that we are developing is selective and specific  may be administered orally once a day  and we believe may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to improve clinical benefits 
the following table summarizes key information regarding our pipeline of product candidates indication product candidates programs current stage of development hbv telbivudine applications seeking marketing authorization have been filed in the us and submitted in the eu  china and certain other territories phase iii and phase iiib valtorcitabine phase iib hcv valopicitabine phase iib nv preclinical hiv nv preclinical in october  we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  including  shares of common stock to novartis 
from this sale of stock  we received approximately million in proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in july  we completed an initial public offering and concurrent private placement in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock in the public offering and  shares of common stock to novartis in the private placement 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from these offerings  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
novartis  which owns approximately of our outstanding common stock at march   has the right to purchase from us that number of shares of our common stock as is required to enable novartis to maintain its percentage ownership in our company 
novartis exercised such right in connection with both public offerings 
novartis also has a contractual right to exercise control over corporate actions that may not require stockholder approval as long as it holds at least of our voting stock 
in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidates 
as part of such arrangement  novartis paid us a license fee of million for our lead hbv product candidates  telbivudine and valtorcitabine  is providing development funding for these hbv product candidates and will make milestone payments  which could total up to 
table of contents million upon the achievement of specific regulatory approvals  as well as additional milestone payments based upon achievement of predetermined sales levels 
novartis also acquired an option to license our hcv and other product candidates 
we recently amended the development agreement with respect to the terms of the option held by novartis relating to valopicitabine  our initial hcv product candidate 
the period within which novartis has the exclusive right to license valopicitabine will expire on march  if novartis exercises its option to collaborate with us on valopicitabine  our initial hcv product candidate  it would be required to provide development funding and pay us up to million in license fees and other payments  based upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones  as well as additional milestone payments based upon achievement of predetermined sales levels 
we plan to co promote or co market with novartis in the us  the uk  france  germany  italy and spain all products novartis licenses from us that are successfully developed and approved for commercial sale 
novartis has the exclusive right to promote and market such products in the rest of the world 
in june  we received a million milestone payment from novartis based upon the results from our phase i clinical trial of valopicitabine 
all of our product candidates are currently in preclinical or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our product candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such product candidates 
we submitted an nda to the fda for telbivudine  our lead hepatitis b product candidate in late in march  we were notified that this submission has been accepted for filing and that the nda is under formal review by the fda 
additionally  to date in  novartis has submitted applications seeking authorization to market telbivudine in other territories  including the european union  china  canada  switzerland  taiwan  and australia 
any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain such required approvals by either us or novartis  will materially adversely affect our ability to realize revenues from commercial sales of telbivudine and our other product candidates  if any  for which marketing authorization is sought and obtained 
even if telbivudine is approved for commercial sale without delay  we do not expect to receive any product sales prior to late at the earliest 
accordingly  we expect our sources of funding for to consist principally of the reimbursement of expenses we may incur in connection with the development of licensed product candidates  and if novartis so elects  license fees relating to valopicitabine 
since our inception through december   we have recognized revenues from license fees  development expense reimbursements received from our collaborators and government grants 
we derived substantially all of our total revenues from novartis for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis 
these revenues include additional development expense funding for our hbv product candidates  valopicitabine if novartis exercises its option to license and other product candidates that novartis may subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales by us or novartis of our licensed product candidates 
revenues recognized from novartis during the year ended december  included million in reimbursements in connection with novartis obligation to fund expenses we incur in connection with the development of telbivudine and valtorcitabine and million in license fees paid to us in by novartis in connection with its license of these product candidates 
revenues recognized from novartis during the year ended december  included million in reimbursements expenses we incurred in connection with the development of telbivudine and valtorcitabine  million in milestone revenue with respect to valopicitabine and million in license fees paid to us in by novartis 
we expect that the amount of revenue we will recognize on a quarterly basis relating to novartis reimbursement of development expenses will vary based on the level of activity and expenses that we incur in such quarter for development of product candidates licensed to novartis 
we are recognizing the million license fee and the million up front payment received in from novartis as revenue over the estimated development period during which we expect to complete our performance obligations under our development agreement with novartis 
we have estimated such period to be approximately six and one half years from the effective date of the development agreement until december the amount of revenue we recognize each quarter is subject to adjustment 

table of contents such adjustments may result from changes in the anticipated length of the development period and our issuance of shares of stock which are subject to the stock subscription rights held by novartis 
the amount will also be subject to adjustment if novartis exercises its option to license valopicitabine or any of our other product candidates and we receive additional license fees 
for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies  see critical accounting policies and estimates collaborative research and development revenue 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in may and expect losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery  development and commercialization activities and the expansion of our operational and administrative infrastructure  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for research and development personnel  including stock based compensation  fees paid to clinical research organizations and other professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical studies  costs of material used in research and development  costs of contract manufacturing consultants  occupancy costs associated with the use of our research facilities and equipment  consulting and license fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development 
we incur the majority of our research and development spending as a result of clinical  preclinical and manufacturing activity with third party contractors relating to the development of our hbv and hcv product candidates 
we expense internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to engage in research activities  further develop our potential product candidates and advance our clinical trials 
set forth below are the direct third party research and development expenses incurred during the period from may  through december   the years ended december   and in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials of our lead hbv and hcv product candidates 
period from may  inception through years ended december  disease december  indication product candidate total in thousands hbv telbivudine     hbv valtorcitabine     hcv valopicitabine     we anticipate that we will incur significant additional direct third party research and development expenses prior to the commercial launch of our hbv and hcv product candidates 
we expect such amounts to approximate those set forth below estimated additional amount of direct third party research and development expenses expected to current stage of be incurred prior to commercial product candidate development launch telbivudine phase iii million valtorcitabine phase iib to million valopicitabine phase iib to million our current estimates of additional direct third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery 
table of contents efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our product candidates on a project by project basis 
pursuant to our development agreement with novartis  after it licenses a product candidate  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
the option we have granted to novartis with respect to its exclusive right to license our product candidates generally requires that novartis exercise the option for each such product candidate prior to the commencement of phase iii clinical trials 
the expenses associated with phase iii clinical trials generally are the most costly component in the development of a successful new product 
our current estimates for additional research and development expenses are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with research  development  clinical trials and the fda and foreign regulatory review and approval processes 
the time and cost to complete development of our product candidates may vary significantly and depends upon a number of factors  including the requirements mandated by the fda and other regulatory agencies  the success of our clinical trials  the availability of financial resources  our collaboration with novartis and its participation in the manufacturing and clinical development of our product candidates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses 
total revenues for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue  net of a million reduction due to novartis stock subscription rights  million in milestone revenue relating to the development of valopicitabine and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses relating to our hepatitis b product candidates 
the decrease in revenues of million for the year ended december  in comparison with was primarily due to a one time million milestone payment received in june from novartis relating to the development of valopicitabine and lower reimbursements from novartis as a result of the decrease in of the development costs for our hepatitis b product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was principally due to an increase of million in expenses for third party contractors  primarily for clinical trials of valopicitabine and the purchase of comparator drug product used in the clinical trials of valopicitabine and an increase of million increase in salary and other payroll related expenses 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities and we engage in a greater number of later stage clinical trials 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in salary and payroll related expenses in support of our growing operations 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue to expand our staff  maintain and enforce our patents and implement new computer systems 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to increases of million in third party consulting expenses and million in salaries and other payroll related expenses attributable to marketing activities in anticipation of our expected launch of telbivudine 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase significantly in as we expand marketing activities  continue to build a commercial infrastructure  hire additional marketing staff and recruit a specialized sales force in the us in anticipation of the expected launch of telbivudine 
we expect such expenses to increase in subsequent periods in connection with the marketing and sale of telbivudine  if approved  and other product candidates  if any  which we may successfully develop and commercialize in the future 
investment income  net net investment income was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  due to the receipt of proceeds from our public offerings completed in july and october income taxes income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  compared with income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax benefits for the years ended december  and were due to amounts our french subsidiary has received or is expected to receive for certain research and development credits 
the increase of million in the income tax benefit was primarily due to higher research and development costs incurred by our french subsidiary in that were eligible for the research and development credit 
our income tax expense consists of tax expense incurred by our us  french and dutch subsidiaries 
in both and  our us and french subsidiaries performed services for us and were reimbursed for these costs  plus a profit margin 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue  net of a million reduction due to novartis stock subscription rights  million in milestone revenue as a result of our achievement of a milestone in the development of valopicitabine and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses 
total revenues for the year ended december  were comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue  net of a million reduction due to 
table of contents novartis common stock subscription rights and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses 
we also incurred a net reduction of million in revenue from sumitomo pharmaceuticals co  ltd  or sumitomo 
this reduction of revenue was incurred when we paid million to sumitomo pursuant to a final settlement agreement in may to reacquire from sumitomo the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan 
this required us to reverse million in revenue previously recognized under the sumitomo arrangement  including revenue in the amount of million recognized in prior to entering into the final settlement agreement 
the increase in revenues of million for the year ended december  in comparison with the year ended december  was primarily due to a full year of reimbursements from novartis of expenses attributable to the development of our hepatitis b product candidates and the achievement of a one time million milestone payment resulting from clinical development of valopicitabine during the year ended december  we entered into the development agreement in may research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in fees and expenses of third party contractors primarily for phase iii clinical trials of telbivudine  purchases of active pharmaceutical ingredient materials and amounts expended on pre clinical studies for valtorcitabine and an increase in salary and other payroll related expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease in research and development expenses resulting from a one time fee of million incurred in relating to a license of certain manufacturing technology associated with our hepatitis b product candidates and million incurred in relating to the settlement of litigation we brought to defend our ownership of certain patents and patent applications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease of million in non cash stock compensation primarily due to the accelerated vesting in may of stock options held by our former chief financial officer and a decrease in professional fees principally related to financial advisory  legal and accounting services rendered in in connection with the novartis transaction 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in other operating costs in support of our growing operations

in july  we completed an initial public offering and concurrent private placement in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock in the public offering and  shares of common stock to novartis in the private placement 
in connection with the initial public offering and concurrent private placement  we received approximately million in net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses

set forth below is a description of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period one to less than three four to after five contractual cash obligations total one year years five years years in thousands operating leases consulting and other agreements total contractual cash obligations in april  we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space in montpellier  france 
the lease term is years expiring in april but is cancellable by either party after six years 
the lease agreement also includes an option entitling us to purchase the building at its fair value in which the leased space is located at any time after april  the purchase option extends until the expiration of the lease term 
in june  we entered into a lease agreement for additional office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the initial lease term is for a period of months expiring in march the lease agreement also provides us with an option  exercisable not later than nine months prior to the expiration of the initial term  to extend the term of the lease for one additional month period and with rights of first offer with respect to certain expansion space on two of the floors that we occupy 
we have certain potential milestone payment obligations relating to our hepatitis b and hepatitis c product candidates 
these obligations are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
pursuant to the uab license agreement  we were granted an exclusive license to the rights that licensors have to a us patent application and counterpart patent applications in europe  canada  japan and australia that cover the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hepatitis b infection 
in january  february and june  uabrf notified us that it intended to file a us continuation patent application claiming priority to the patent application  which itself is a continuation in part of a application that would purportedly enable the licensors to prosecute and seek to obtain generic patent claims that would generally encompass the method of using telbivudine to treat patients infected with hepatitis b 
in july  uabrf filed such a continuation patent application 
in february  uabrf notified us that it and emory university were asserting a claim that the uab license agreement covers our telbivudine technology and that we are currently obligated to pay to the licensors an aggregate of million comprised of of the million license fee we received from novartis in may in connection with the license of our hepatitis b product candidates and a million 
table of contents payment in connection with the submission to the fda of the ind pursuant to which we have conducted our clinical development of telbivudine 
we disagree that the patent application or corresponding foreign applications provide an adequate basis for the issuance of a valid and enforceable patent claim covering the use of telbivudine to treat hepatitis b 
we intend to dispute these assertions 
under the terms of the uab license agreement  the dispute will be resolved by a panel of arbitrators if we are unable to reach agreement with uabrf after a period of negotiation and mediation 
we do not believe that it is probable that uabrf s position will be upheld and as such  we have not recorded a liability as of december  however  if it is determined that the uab license agreement does cover our technology  we will become obligated to make payments to the licensors in the amounts and manner specified in the uab license agreement 
such amounts in addition to those asserted by uabrf and emory university include payments in the aggregate amount of million due upon achievement of regulatory milestones  a royalty on annual sales up to million and a royalty on annual sales greater than million made by us or an affiliate of ours 
additionally  if we sublicense our rights to any entity other than one which holds or controls at least of our capital stock  or if novartis ownership interest in us declines below of our outstanding shares of capital stock  we could be obligated to pay to the licensors of all royalties received by us from sales by the sublicensee of telbivudine and of all fees  milestone payments and other cash consideration we receive from the sublicensee with respect to telbivudine 
if it is determined that the uab license agreement between us and uabrf does cover our use of telbivudine to treat hepatitis b  or we must otherwise rely upon a license agreement granted by the licensors to commercialize telbivudine  we may be in breach of certain of the representations and warranties we made to novartis under the development agreement and the stock purchase agreement 
for a further description see collaborations relationship with novartis indemnification and risk factors factors related to our relationship with novartis and factors related to patents and licenses 
additionally  in connection with the resolution of matters relating to certain of our hepatitis c product candidates we entered into a settlement agreement with uabrf  which provides for a milestone payment of million to uabrf upon receipt of regulatory approval in the us to market and sell certain hepatitis c products invented or discovered by our chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  such hepatitis c products would include valopicitabine if successfully developed and commercialized 
further  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the university of cagliari pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell valopicitabine and certain other hcv and hiv technology 
we are liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive from novartis or another collaborator license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology 
the settlement agreement which we have entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities together with funding we expect to receive from novartis relating to the development of our hbv product candidates  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs until at least the end of at any time  it is possible that we may seek additional financing 
we may seek such financing through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships and other arrangements 
additional funding may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  other than novartis which has the right to maintain its current ownership level  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to obtain financing when needed may harm our business and operating results 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and the fair value of stock related to stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this document  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements collaborative research and development revenue we recognize revenues relating to our collaborative research and development arrangements in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues under such collaborative research and development arrangements may include non refundable license fees  milestones and research and development payments from collaborative partners 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  we recognize non refundable license fees as revenue over the specified development period during which we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of our management 
if this estimated performance period changes  then we will adjust the periodic revenue we are recognizing and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable license fees over the remaining period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
novartis has the right to purchase  at par value of per share  such number of shares as is required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock if we issue shares of capital stock in connection with the acquisition or in licensing of technology through the issuance of up to of our stock in any month period 
the novartis stock purchase rights will remain in effect until the earlier of the date that novartis and its affiliates own less than of our voting stock or the date that novartis becomes obligated to make contingent payments of million to those holders of the our stock who sold shares to novartis on may  additionally  if we issue any shares of our capital stock  other than in certain situations  novartis has the right to purchase such number of shares required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock for the same consideration per share paid by others acquiring our stock 
subject to certain exceptions  upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  other than the equity incentive plan  we record  as a reduction of the upfront license fee and payments received from novartis in may  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized as of that date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts are adjusted through the date that either novartis elects to exercise its stock subscription rights or the right expires 
these adjustments will also be attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the measurement date and the remaining deferred revenue 
to date  we have received million from novartis as a license fee for our hbv product candidates and a million reimbursement for reacquiring product rights from sumitomo to develop and commercialize telbivudine in certain markets in asia 
we have included this reimbursement as part of our up front license 
table of contents fee for accounting purposes because novartis required the repurchase of these rights as a condition of entering into the development agreement with us 
we are recognizing these payments from novartis as revenue over the estimated period during which we expect to complete our performance obligations under our development agreement 
we have estimated such period to be approximately six and one half years from the effective date of the agreement in may until december in connection with the closing of our initial public offering in july  novartis terminated a common stock subscription right with respect to  shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the equity incentive plan in connection with the exercise of stock options granted after may  in exchange for novartis termination of such right  we issued  shares of our common stock to novartis for a purchase price of per share 
the fair value of these shares was determined to be million at the time of issuance 
as a result of the issuance to novartis of these shares  novartis rights to purchase additional shares as a result of future option grants and stock issuances under the equity incentive plan were terminated and no additional adjustments to revenue and deferred revenue will be required for options exercised under this plan 
prior to the termination of the stock subscription rights under the equity incentive plan  as we granted options that were subject to novartis stock subscription right  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less par value  was recorded as an adjustment of the license fee and payments received from novartis in may we are still subject to potential revenue adjustments relating to future grants of options and stock awards under our stock incentive plan and other equity plans that our board of directors may approve and stockholders adopt 
as of december   the license fee has been reduced by million and has been reclassified to additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue as of december  with the remaining amount of million recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we recorded a minor reduction to revenue during the year ended december  and a million and a million reduction of revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet at december  representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo upon the first commercial sale of telbivudine in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
if and when we determine that we will not seek regulatory approval for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
we recognize payments received from collaborative partners for research and development efforts that we perform or others perform on our behalf as revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we recognize such revenue only if we believe that collection of these amounts is reasonably assured 
this assessment involves judgment on our part 
if we do not believe that collection of amounts billed  or amounts to be billed to our collaborators  is reasonably assured  then we defer revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from milestones related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations upon achievement of the milestone if the milestone is deemed substantive 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and 
table of contents the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
in june  we recognized a million milestone payment from novartis based upon results of a phase i clinical trial relating to valopicitabine 
since the milestone was determined to be substantive  this amount was recognized as revenue when it became payable 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification from the collaborative partner of achievement of the milestones 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which we refer to as eitf no 
eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into on or after july  accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants  and investigators in conjunction with preclinical and clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials related to our product candidates 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we also record estimates of our tax liabilities for the jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of the tax effects involving our us and foreign operations involves judgment on our part and our positions could be challenged by the tax authorities of these jurisdictions 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and account for these estimates in accordance with accounting principles involving accrued expenses and income tax liabilities generally accepted in the us stock based compensation in connection with the grant of certain stock options  we have recorded in stockholders equity an aggregate amount of million in deferred stock compensation at december  these stock options were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock was greater than the exercise price on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of our common stock involved significant judgment on our part because our shares prior to the completion of our initial public offering in july were not publicly traded 
in determining the fair value  our board of directors considered the price at which we sold shares of convertible preferred stock to investors  the purchase price per share  including the initial cash payment and the discounted present value of the contingent payments  paid by novartis in may to acquire shares of our common stock from our existing stockholders  the development stage of our product candidates and general economic and market conditions

this statement replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method 
sfas no 
r requires such transactions to be accounted using a fair value based method that would result in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
r beginning in the first quarter after december  as a result  we expect to incur additional stock compensation expense related to stock options granted as of december  and future stock option grants 
we expect that sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we expect to adopt the modified prospective method in which stock compensation expense will be determined based on fair value using the black scholes method at grant dates of stock options 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated stock based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option and restricted stock grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp  effective january   provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and equity securities should be considered other than temporary  as well as the subsequent accounting for these investments 
the adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and supersedes fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the provisions of the sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in july  the fasb published an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the exposure draft seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with recognition and measurement in the accounting for income taxes 
it would apply to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the exposure draft requires that a tax position meet a probable recognition threshold for the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
this threshold is to be met assuming that the tax authorities will examine the uncertain tax position 
the exposure draft contains guidance with respect to the measurement of the benefit that is recognized for an uncertain tax position  when that benefit should be derecognized  and other matters 
this proposed interpretation would clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas the fasb staff commenced redeliberations of the interpretation in november  and the board is expected to issue a final interpretation  which would include amendments to sfas  in the second quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact this proposed interpretation would have on our results of operations
