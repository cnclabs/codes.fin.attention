item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our financial results reflect a significant change in the company due to the merger with molson  inc  as well as challenging operating environments in all of our major businesses 
our net sales of billion increased by billion  or  while the volume of beer sold by our company increased by million barrels  or 
the main driver of these increases was the inclusion of the result of molson s business in canada  as a result of the merger which occurred on february  our operating income increased to million from million as a result of molson s inclusion in our results 
operating income in included special items  discussed in more detail below and later in this section  of million of expense  while operating income included million of special income items 
net income was million per diluted share in  down from million per diluted share in net income for included a loss from discontinued operations  represented by our former brazil segment  of million 
for comparability purposes  certain discussions in this section  particularly those regarding canada  and in some instances for consolidated results  will also include pro forma comparisons  as if molson s results were included in our pre merger results from the beginning of on a pro forma basis  net sales from continuing operations were billion for  down from pro forma net income in was million  or per diluted share 
components of our income statement net sales our net sales represent almost exclusively the sale of beer and malt beverages  the vast majority of which are brands that we own and brew ourselves 
we import or brew and sell certain non owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements 
we also sell certain factored brands  as a distributor  to customers in the united kingdom europe segment 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold include costs we incur to make and ship beer 
these costs include brewing materials  such as barley  in the united states and united kingdom where we manufacture our own malt 
in canada  we purchase malt from third parties 
hops and various starches are other key brewing materials purchased by all of our segments 
packaging materials  including costs for glass bottles  aluminum cans  and cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold also include both direct and indirect labor  freight costs  utilities  maintenance costs  and other manufacturing overheads 
marketing  general and administrative these costs include media advertising television  radio  print  tactical advertising signs  banners  point of sale materials and promotion costs planned and executed on both local and national levels within our operating segments 
also included here are costs to run our sales organizations  including labor and other overheads 
lastly  this classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance  legal  human resources and information technology  which consist primarily of labor and outside services 
special items these are unique items which affect our income statement  which are discussed below 
other income expense this classification includes primarily gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to brewing and selling beer 
for instance  gains or losses on sales of non operating assets  our share of income or loss associated with our ownership in the montr al canadiens hockey club  and certain foreign exchange gains and losses are classified here 
interest income expense  net interest costs associated with borrowings to finance our operations are included in the corporate unallocated costs 
interest income in the europe segment is associated with certain trade loans receivable from customers 
discussions of income statement line items such as minority interests  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are discussed in detail elsewhere in md a and in the notes to the financial statements 
discontinued operations the company s business in brazil  which was acquired as part of the merger  is now reported as discontinued operations due to the sale of a controlling interest in the business on january  during  the brazil business affected the company s financial results in the following ways  all of which are not expected to impact the company s results in reporting periods following the sale the income statement impact included losses that totaled million  or per diluted share  in since the company s effective tax rate did not benefit from these brazil losses  these represent after tax impacts on the company s financial results 
as a result of the sale  the company s balance sheet will improve in two principal ways the company s total debt position improves by approximately million in versus following the brazil sale with the inflow of million of sale proceeds and the elimination of approximately million of brazil financial debt 
contingent liabilities of approximately million  related primarily to tax claims  are removed from the company s balance sheet 
mcbc does have a level of continuing potential exposure to these contingent liabilities of kaiser  as well as previously disclosed but less than probable un accrued claims  due to certain indemnities provided to femsa pursuant to the sales and purchase agreement underlying the sale of our majority interest in kaiser 
such indemnities are more fully described in note on page while the company believes that all significant contingencies have been disclosed as part of the sale process and adequately reserved for on the kaiser financial statements  resolution of contingencies and claims above reserved or otherwise disclosed amounts could  under some circumstances  result in additional liabilities for molson coors because of transaction related indemnity provisions 
the brazil business reduced the company s free cash flow by million during due primarily to operating losses and interest expense 
special items the company reported special items totaling million during these special charges were primarily related to accelerated initiatives to improve the company s future performance and were as follows the us segment recorded special charges of million during  primarily related to closing the memphis brewery  including accelerated asset depreciation and estimated costs associated with settling pension obligations for memphis brewery workers 
the canada segment recorded special charges of million during  related primarily to restructuring of the sales and marketing organizations 
the europe segment recorded net special charges of million during  primarily attributable to restructuring expenses for cost reduction initiatives  as well as costs related to the closure of the company s sales operation in russia and taiwan  netted against a net gain on disposals of assets during the year 
we estimate annual savings from the europe initiatives to approximate million allocated to selling  general and administrative and to cost of goods sold beginning special charges allocated to corporate in were million  substantially all of which million were associated with severance and other costs related to change in control and other agreements with departing officers following the merger 
these costs are discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item on page merger synergies update during  the company captured million in merger related cost synergies  surpassing the company s goal of million 
the company s merger related synergies goals are an incremental million in and total annual synergies of million  which are expected by the third year following the completion of the merger 
as a result of work performed by our synergy and operating teams during the first year of the merger  we now anticipate capturing million in additional cost reduction opportunities by the end of  above and beyond the original million year three synergies target 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle molson coors has adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin under which companies must recognize potential long term liabilities related to the eventual retirement of assets 
as a result of adopting fin  the company recorded a cumulative non cash expense of million  after tax  in the fourth quarter  reported as cumulative effect of change in accounting in the company s income statement 
as reported in the company s fourth quarter and full year results  this expense represents accumulated remediation and restoration costs expected to be incurred up to years in the future for anticipated asset retirements 
following this catch up expense in the fourth quarter  the company does not expect fin related expense to have a significant impact on its annual operating results 
results of operations united states segment the united states us segment produces  markets  and sells the coors portfolio of brands in the united states and its territories and includes the results of the rocky mountain metal corporation rmmc and rocky mountain bottle corporation rmbc joint ventures consolidated beginning in under fin r 
the us segment also includes a small amount of coors brand volume that is sold outside of the united states and its territories  including primarily mexico and the caribbean and sales of molson products in the united states 
fiscal year ended december  percent change december  percent change december  in thousands  except percentages volume in barrels    net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    marketing  general and administrative expenses  special items  net  operating income    other expense  income  net  segment earnings before income taxes   consists primarily of gains from sales of non operating assets  water rights  a royalty settlement and equity share of molson usa losses in and earnings before income taxes in and includes  and  respectively  of the minority owners share of income attributable to the rmbc and rmmc joint ventures 
net sales full year us sales increased in versus  driven by volume increases in the coors light  keystone light  and blue moon brands  and the addition of molson brands sold in the united states included in us results following the merger 
coors light s performance improved because of better sales execution  an ad campaign the silver bullet train  and increased promotional activities 
in addition  coors light benefited from the strength of the premium light beer category which increased in offsetting these were volume declines related to coors original  aspen edge and zima 
net sales per barrel increased from to we saw favorable front line pricing in  partially offset by significant price promotions and coupons and reflective of the competitive landscape 
these factors combined allowed for approximately one half of the increase in revenue per barrel 
collection of fuel surcharges from customers was the next largest factor contributing to the increase in net sales per barrel 
however  our efforts to recover the higher costs of fuel from customers do not completely mitigate our exposure in this area  as discussed below under cost of goods sold 
us net sales improved by in versus  although sales volumes were lower year over year 
net sales per barrel improved by in versus  benefiting from a favorable industry pricing environment and lower price promotion levels in us sales in benefited from the introduction of aspen edge early in the year  and strong growth from the blue moon and zima xxx brands later in the year 
collection of fuel price surcharges from customers added million 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold per barrel increased by from per barrel in to per barrel in the increase in cost of goods sold per barrel was driven by high inflation in freight  diesel fuel  packaging materials  and energy costs 
inflation alone would have accounted for an increase of approximately in cost of goods per barrel 
however  these unfavorable factors were offset partially by favorable cost trends from supply chain cost management  labor productivity and synergies from the merger 
cost of goods sold increased million or in versus on a per barrel basis  the increase was approximately 
the increase was the net effect of inflation primarily higher fuel and packaging costs million  as well as increased labor related expenses million and a mix shift to higher cost brands and packages  such as aspen edge in million  offset by the cycling of extra expense related to our supply chain system implementation costs in million  and the implementation of fin r which had the effect of reducing our cost of sales by re allocating certain joint venture expenses in our income statement out of cost of sales million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or in versus increased spending on sales capabilities were offset by lower general and administrative overhead costs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared to  or 
this represents an additional per barrel increase 
the increase is due to higher investments in sales and marketing efforts million  in addition to modestly higher labor related costs million 
special items special items in the us segment in were associated primarily with the planned closure of the memphis brewery  targeted for late we recorded million in accelerated depreciation on brewery assets  reflecting their revised useful lives  million in direct impairments of assets  million for accruals of severance and associated benefits  and million representing an estimate of costs to settle multi employer pension plan obligations associated with memphis workers 
we recorded an additional million of restructuring charges associated with brewery operations in golden 
other income  net other income was lower in versus  primarily due to two large factors that occurred in but did not occur in first  we recorded million of gains on the sale of certain owned  non operating real estate  and second  we recorded royalties of million from the receipt of cash in associated with a settlement from the purchaser of a coal mine previously owned by coors 
other income increased in versus for primarily the same reasons listed in the previous paragraph 
canada segment before the merger  the canada segment consisted of coors brewing company s interest in the coors canada partnership through which the coors light business in canada was conducted 
molson was the other owner of the partnership 
the partnership contracted with molson for the brewing  distribution and the sale of coors light in canada 
coors canada managed all marketing activities for our products in canada 
in connection with the merger  coors canada and sale of coors light in canada was dissolved into the canada segment 
coors light is currently molson canada s largest selling beer  the largest selling light beer and the second best selling packaged beer brand overall in canada 
following the merger  our canada segment consists primarily of molson s beer business including the production and sale of the molson brands  principally in canada  our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in ontario and the western provinces  brewers retail  inc bri consolidated under fin r  and brewers distribution limited bdl

income from the coors canada partnership was higher in versus primarily as a result of improved product pricing for coors light million 
a stronger canadian dollar million and higher beer volume million also contributed to improved canada results 
earnings before income taxes in include  of the minority owner s share of income attributable to the brewer s retail inc joint venture

increase due to currency effect in thousands net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  marketing  general and administrative expenses  special items operating income  other income expense  net income before income taxes and minority interests  net sales for the year ended december   pro forma net sales in the canada segment were billion  higher than the comparable period in the prior year 
net sales revenue per barrel in canada grew slightly in local currency for the year ended december   driven by modest general price increases offset by unfavorable product mix 
net unfavorable sales mix was driven by value segment growth  primarily in ontario and alberta  which was partially offset by improved import sales at higher than average sale prices 
canada segment net sales volume for the year ended december   decreased to million barrels million hectoliters on a comparable pro forma basis from a year ago 
the decrease was driven by volume declines in the first quarter  partially offset by strong industry volume trends and improved sales activity and market performance over the balance of cost of goods sold and gross profit on a pro forma basis  cost of goods sold increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period for for the same period  in local currency  cost of goods sold per barrel in canada decreased as synergy and other cost savings were offset by unfavorable product mix 
marketing  general and administrative expenses on a pro forma basis  marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period for canada increased marketing and sales spending at a high single digit growth rate 
in local currency general and administrative costs increased due to higher depreciation  increased employee costs and non recurring items partially offset by merger related synergies 
special items special charges of million were attributed primarily to restructuring the sales and marketing organizations in canada 
these efforts will further integrate the marketing and selling organizations into one team  improving our brand communications and customer focus 
special charges in of million were merger related  and therefore did not recur in other expense income  net other expense represents the equity earnings in the montr al canadiens hockey club 
europe segment the europe segment consists of our production and sale of the cbl brands principally in the united kingdom  our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of grolsch in the united kingdom and republic of ireland consolidated under fin r beginning in  factored brand sales beverage brands owned by other companies  but sold and delivered to retail by us  and our joint venture arrangement with exel logistics for the distribution of products throughout great britain tradeteam 
our europe segment also includes a small volume of sales in asia  russia and other export markets 
fiscal year ended december  percent change december  percent change december  in thousands  except percentages volume in barrels    net sales    cost of goods sold   gross profit    marketing  general and administrative expenses  special items   operating income    interest income    other expense income  net   segment earnings before income taxes   earnings before income taxes in and includes   net of tax and   net of tax of the minority owner s share of income attributable to the grolsch joint venture 
foreign currency impact on results our europe segment was adversely affected by a year over year decrease in the value of the british pound sterling gbp or against the us dollar in conversely  the europe segment benefited from a year over year increase in the value of the gbp against the us dollar in the following summarizes the impact on the europe segment s income statement 
increase due to currency effects in thousands net sales   cost of goods sold   gross profit   marketing  general administrative and special item   operating income   interest income  other income expense  net  income before income taxes and minority interests   for  assuming the same rates as  for  assuming the same rates as net sales net sales for the europe segment decreased in  while volume decreased from the previous year 
currency exchange rates accounted for approximately of the decrease in net sales 
the volume decline was driven by the grolsch brand  flavored alcohol beverages fabs and ales 
this decline was partially offset by growth of the carling brand 
cbl s overall volume decline for the year was slightly worse than the overall market decline 
beer volume in our on premise business  which represents approximately two thirds of our europe volume and an even greater portion of margin  declined by compared to this compared to an overall on premise market decline for beer as a category of in the year  yielding a small market share gain for us 
our off premise volume for decreased approximately over  driven by decline in grolsch volume 
we experienced a small off premise market share decline 
in addition to the volume movements documented above  we experienced unfavorable pricing in both the on premise and the off premise channels  and a decrease in the sales value of factored brands 
these reductions were compounded by unfavorable channel and brand mix 
a change in our trading arrangements with one major factored brand customer has required us to move from gross reporting of sales and cost of goods sold to a net presentation for that customer  which caused a year over year reduction in both net sales and cost of goods sold of million  but with no net impact on gross profit 
owned brand net sales per barrel decreased approximately for the year 
net sales for the europe segment increased in from  while volume increased from the previous year 
the volume growth was driven by the carling and grolsch brands 
volume growth for the year was restricted by the cooler and wetter summer weather in the united kingdom compared to a record breaking summer in and the comparison to a period of high off premise discounting in the first half of our on premise business saw volume decline by in compared to this compared to an overall on premise market decline of in the year  yielding a market share gain of approximately 
our off premise volume for increased approximately over  led by carling and grolsch 
our off premise market share growth for the year was approximately percentage points 
in addition to the volume movements documented above  we had positive pricing in in both the on premise and the off premise channels  and an increase in the sales value of factored brands 
these gains were partially offset by negative channel and brand mix 
owned brand net sales per barrel increased approximately in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased in versus the decrease in local currency cost of goods sold was driven by the gross to net reporting of sales and cost of goods sold for the one major on premise customer discussed above that reduced factored cost of goods sold by million but with no impact on gross profit  combined with a mix shift away from glass packaged products which have higher packaging costs 
these reductions were partially offset by the de leveraging of fixed costs  higher distribution costs due to the implementation of the european working time directive  which has restricted the number of hours that drivers are allowed to work  and increased energy costs 
cost of goods sold increased in versus  with approximately of the increase being due to the effect of gbp currency exchange rates 
the increase in local currency cost of goods sold in was driven by increased volume and higher labor costs  together with a mix shift to the off premise where products have higher packaging costs  and an increase in the value of factored brand purchases where the cost is included in our cost of goods sold 
these increases were offset by the benefit of a reduction in contract packaging costs from  where we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off premise volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packaging lines in our burton brewery 
on a per barrel basis  cost of goods sold increased  excluding the impact of gbp currency exchange rates cost of goods sold per barrel was broadly flat compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses europe marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased during versus  and on a per barrel basis 
this decrease is primarily the result of lower overhead  sales and marketing and payroll related spending 
europe marketing  general and administrative expenses increased during versus  and on a per barrel basis 
gbp foreign exchange accounted for the great majority of this increase 
special items special items of million largely relate to employee restructuring activities associated with operations and supply chain restructuring efforts million and asset impairments million  partly offset by profits on the sale of surplus real estate million 
also included in are exit costs associated with the closure of our russia and taiwan offices 
special income in represents the profit on sale of real estate 
other expense income  net the adverse movement in other expense income  net in and continues to be the result of declining tradeteam operating performance  and increased non operating leasehold expenses 
interest income interest income is earned on trade loans to uk on premise customers 
interest income decreased and in and  respectively  as a result of lower loan balances versus the prior years 
corporate corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the operating segments 
the majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions  such as corporate affairs  legal  human resources  insurance and risk management 
fiscal year ended december  percent change december  percent change december  in thousands  except percentages net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  marketing  general and administrative expenses  special items  operating loss    interest expense  net    other expense income  net   loss before income taxes   the amounts shown are reflective of revenues and costs associated with the company s intellectual property  including trademarks and brands 
prior period amounts have not been reclassified due to immateriality 
special items consist of change in control expenses incurred as a consequence of the merger 
see further discussion in the executive summary above 
loss before income taxes in and includes  and  of the minority owner s share of interest expense attributable to debt obligations of the rmmc joint venture 
marketing  general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were higher in versus  primarily due to establishing the new global organization and headquarters  significant legal fees for defense costs associated with shareholder lawsuits and regulatory inquiries  information technology projects  and a reallocation of certain g a costs from segments to corporate 
general and administrative expenses were higher in  versus  primarily due to increased incentive compensation and other labor related costs 
interest expense  net net interest expense nearly doubled in  compared to due to the addition of merger related debt including debt assumed on molson s opening balance sheet which approximated billion 
subsequent to the merger  we established a billion bridge facility which was used to refinance pre merger molson debt 
we also established a billion  five year credit facility which was used to refinance a portion of the bridge facility borrowings 
we had million outstanding under the credit facility at december  subsequent to establishing both of these facilities  the existing bank facilities at both molson and coors were terminated 
the bridge loan facility was refinanced with proceeds from approximately billion of senior notes  which were issued on september  see related note on page net interest expense decreased in  compared to due to our paydown of debt and from swapping some of our debt from fixed to more favorable floating rates 
full year debt repayments of million were about above our cash flow and debt paydown benefited from asset monetizations and capital spending discipline in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities  external borrowings and asset monetizations 
as of december   including cash and short term borrowings  we had negative working capital of million compared to positive working capital of million at december  the largest contribution to the decrease in working capital is a million increase in current portions of long term debt and short term borrowings 
the increase attributable to current portions of long term debt reflects the company s intentions in with regard to debt paydown under our commercial paper and credit facilities 
cash balances were lower at the end of than by million  which also contributed to our decrease in working capital 
cash balances were higher at the end of  partially because of the unavailability of debt eligible for pay down in an economical manner at that time 
working capital associated with discontinued operations in brazil amounted to a negative million as of the end of  an amount which did not exist at the end of deferred tax assets and liabilities  net  related to working capital items contributed negatively to working capital by million year over year 
most other working capital items increased expectedly with the addition of molson to the balance sheet in versus however  it is notable that accounts receivable did not increase  due largely to the impact of the uk business at cbl 
cbl maintains a comparatively larger receivables balance than other segments as a percentage of sales  and in their receivables balance dropped in us due to a weaker pound versus the dollar at the end of versus  and their receivables were significantly lower in local currency because of lower sales 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  total outstanding debt  including current portions of long term debt and short term borrowings  was  million at december   and million at december  the increase is due to debt assumed in the merger  offset by debt pay downs during we believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short term borrowings  when necessary  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements  scheduled principal and interest payments on debt  dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products  which could arise from competitive circumstances  a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages  any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled risk factors on page operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million  a decrease of million from the addition of molson s canadian beer business made a significant positive contribution to our operating cash flow 
however  there were several items that offset this increase 
first  in early we made a million canadian tax payment  previously deferred by molson 
our total tax expense for the year was only million  and there were additional tax payments to other governmental authorities in addition to the million 
second  we funded million into our defined benefit pension plans in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  compared with book expense associated with these plans of million 
operating cash flow in also diminished because of worse operating results in the europe segment  and severance and change in control payments to officers who departed the company following the merger 
net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by million  compared to the decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash taxes in versus when favorable finalization of tax audits resulted in refunds  offset by the reporting of additional cash flows as a result of consolidating certain joint ventures in also  improved sales at the end of  compared to resulted in higher receivable and inventory balances  which served to lower cash flows from operations in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million in capital expenditures were higher by million in due to the inclusion of molson s canada segment capital expenditures of million following the merger  and spending in the united states related to the build out of the shenandoah facility to a full brewery 
we also spent million in to acquire creemore springs  a small brewery in canada  and spent million on transaction costs associated with the merger 
these factors were offset by the favorable impact of acquiring million in cash with the merger and collecting a net million on trade loan activity in the united kingdom 
cash used in investing activities decreased million during compared to this improvement is attributable to reduced capital spending in million lower  cash received from the sale of kegs in the united kingdom and the sales of real estate and other property in both the united states and the united kingdom million in compared to million in  and a pension settlement received in million from interbrew former owners of cbl in the united kingdom 
also  we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of as result of implementing fin r 
financing activities our debt position significantly affects our financing activity 
see note on page for a summary of our debt position at december  and december  net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in during  we paid dividends to stockholders of million  compared to million in  as a result of increased shares outstanding and a revised dividend policy following the merger 
the large increase in our balance sheet debt from million at year end to  million at year end was largely the result of a non cash activity  that of assuming molson s outstanding debt as of the merger date february  
this debt assumed included borrowings molson incurred prior to the merger to pay the special dividends on molson stock which preceded the merger 
substantially all of our debt pay down occurred after the merger date 
also  we collected approximately million less in versus as a result of stock option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in the change is mainly the result of increased repayments of debt in  offset by cash received from increased stock option exercises during the year 
capital expenditures in  we spent approximately million including approximately million spent at consolidated joint ventures on capital improvement projects worldwide 
of this  approximately half was in support of the us business with the remainder split almost equally between the european canadian businesses 
capital investment in the brazilian discontinued operations and corporate segment combined represented less than of our total spending 
the capital expenditure plan for is expected to be approximately million excluding capital spending by consolidated joint ventures  and will be impacted by the completion of the shenandoah brewery build out and synergy related investments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt  including current maturities   interest payments     derivative payments     retirement plan expenditures    operating leases      capital leases    other long term obligations    total obligations     we have had several significant changes to our debt obligations in  primarily related to merger related debt and the issuance of new bonds in canada totaling approximately billion in september included in our debt obligations at december  are bonds issued by bri  which is consolidated under fin r 
see note to the accompanying financial statements on page the interest payments line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at december   excluding the positive cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps 
current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented 
the derivative payments line includes the interest rate swap and cross currency swap payment obligations only  which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements 
current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented 
we will be receiving a total of  million in fixed rate payments from our counterparties under the swap arrangements  which offset the payments included in the table 
as interest rates increase  payments to our counterparties will also increase 
net interest payments  including swap receipts and payments  over the periods presented are as follows in thousands 
total less than year years years after years interest and derivative payments  net of derivative receipts  represents expected contributions under our defined benefit funded pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented 
includes a uk sale lease back included in a global information services agreement signed with electronic data systems eds late in  effective january  and totaling million at december  the new eds contract includes services to our us and europe operations and our corporate offices and  unless extended  will expire in approximately billion of the total other long term obligations relate to long term supply contracts to purchase raw material and energy used in production  including our contract with graphic packaging corporation  a related party  dated march  approximately million relates to commitments associated with tradeteam in the united kingdom 
the remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing  information technology services  open purchase orders and other commitments 
obligations of our brazil segment are not included because of our interest in brazil was sold to femsa on january  for additional information regarding this transaction  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page other commercial commitments as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years in thousands standby letters of credit    total commercial commitments    advertising and promotions as of december   our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions  including marketing at sports arenas  stadiums and other venues and events  total approximately billion over the next five years and thereafter 
our advertising and promotions commitments are included in other long term obligations in the table above 
credit rating as of february   our credit rating with standard poors with regard to our long term debt was bbb 
if this rating were to drop  our access to the commercial paper market for shorter term borrowings could be unfavorably impacted  resulting in either higher interest rates or an inability to borrow through commercial paper at all 
our commercial paper borrowings at december  were million 
pension plans our consolidated  unfunded pension position at the end of was approximately million  an increase of million from the end of the increase is the result of adding canada s unfunded position totaling million after the merger  netted against improvements in the us and uk unfunded pension positions 
the primary cause of the improvements was the doubling of the actual uk returns on assets during  compared to  and additional pension contributions in the united states of million in  compared to our accumulated benefit obligation increased by billion in  primarily due to the addition of the canadian plans after the merger 
the prior service cost component of our us pension obligations declined by approximately million in due to changes in our salaried employee benefit formula in july the benefit formula is now calculated based upon a salaried employee s career average compensation  instead of the last five years average compensation 
the uk obligations decreased due to a plan amendment in  as well 
the uk plan amendment served to reduce obligations in accordance with new benefit calculations approved by pension regulators during the year 
the net consolidated result of movements in pension obligations and pension assets was a net increase in minimum pension obligations of million at the end of it is our practice to fund pension plans to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws 
however  management may voluntarily increase funding levels to meet expense and asset return forecasts in any given year 
pension contributions on a consolidated basis were million in  reflecting statutory contribution levels in canada and the united kindgom  and million of voluntary contributions in the united states 
we anticipate making approximately million of both statutory and voluntary contributions to our pension plans in consolidated pension expense was million in  an increase of million from canada accounted for million of the increase  and change in control increases due to departing coors executives accounted for the remaining million 
primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of  compared to  we anticipate pension expense on a consolidated basis for of approximately million 
contingencies brazil guarantees on january   we sold a equity interest in kaiser to femsa for million cash  plus the assumption by femsa of kaiser related debt and contingencies 
kaiser related debt at year end totaled approximately million 
kaiser was our previously reported brazil operating segment 
we retained a interest in kaiser and have one seat on its board 
we determined that our brazil segment represented a discontinued operation as of december  as a result  we have segregated the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the brazil segment in our financial statements to be reflected as discontinued operations 
the terms of the agreement require us to indemnify femsa for certain exposures related to tax  civil and labor contingencies arising prior to femsa s purchase of kaiser 
first  we provided a full indemnity for any losses kaiser may incur with respect to tax claims associated with previously utilized purchased tax credits 
any potential liabilities associated with these exposures were not considered probable during the total amount of potential claims in this regard  plus estimated accumulated penalties and interest  is million 
second  we provided an indemnity related to all other tax  civil and labor contingencies provided  however  that femsa assumed their full share of all contingent liabilities that had been recorded and disclosed by us 
we may have to provide indemnity to femsa if those liabilities are resolved for amounts greater than those amounts recorded or disclosed by us 
we will be able to offset any indemnity exposures in these circumstances with amounts that are resolved favorably to amounts previously recorded 
we will record these guarantee liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  and the creation of those liabilities will reduce the expected gain on the sale of of the business to be reported in the first quarter of guarantees under arrangements with the montr al canadiens molson inc sold the majority of its ownership in the montr al canadiens professional hockey club the club to a purchaser in molson maintains a common ownership interest in the club  as well as a preferred interest  redeemable in the shareholders of the club the purchaser and molson and the national hockey league nhl are parties to a consent agreement  which requires the purchaser and molson to abide by funding requirements included in the terms of the shareholders agreement and for molson to provide a net working capital of million and funding to enable the club to meet its operating expenses 
in addition  molson has given certain guarantees to the nhl and the lenders of the purchaser of the club and the bell centre formerly the molson centre  such that in the event that the club and the purchaser are not able to meet their obligations  or in the event of a default  we shall provide adequate support to the purchaser through necessary cash payments so that the purchaser would have sufficient funds to meet its debt obligations  and exercise control of the entity which owns the club and the entertainment business operated at the bell centre at predetermined conditions  subject to nhl approval 
the obligations of the purchaser to such lenders were cdn million approximately us million at december  as part of the sale transaction  molson reaffirmed an existing guarantee of the purchaser s payment obligations on a year lease arrangement which began in related to the land upon which the bell centre has been constructed 
annual lease payments in were cdn million approximately us million  and are adjusted annually to reflect prevailing interest rates and changes in the consumer price index 
we have accrued the fair value of our guarantees under these arrangements as of december  outlook for us segment coors light is the key to success in the us business  and our primary sales and marketing programs revolve around this brand 
in  we focused on chain retail accounts  the hispanic market  and the on premise channel 
coors light achieved a significant turn around in by posting three consecutive growth quarters to finish  following several quarters of declining sales to retail 
our plan in is to build on this momentum 
the us business also will focus on capturing the identified cost savings from merger synergies and other cost initiatives 
much of the cost improvement potential as a merged company centers on the us business  and it is important to achieve these cost savings as inflationary pressures continue to impact our cost of goods sold 
we are planning to close the memphis  tennessee brewery in the fall of the shenandoah  virginia brewery is expected to be fully operational in we expect to continue to account for exit cost and other costs related to the memphis brewery closure as special items in  including accelerated depreciation  expected severance  and revisions of estimates for pension obligations 
canada segment a main objective of was to stabilize year over year volume with renewed investment in mainstream brands 
share trends in the fourth quarter continued to show strong progress on coors light  and the molson canadian brand was flat in the quarter  the best result in more than two years 
the value segment continued its growth trend to close out  however  as we have begun to cycle the substantial ramp up of value brand activity in the prior year  the value segment is expected to continue to grow on a year over year basis in at a lower rate 
coors light and molson canadian remain critical to our success 
our top line programs are focused around these brands  while investing strategically across the entire portfolio 
during we will remain focused on the objectives laid out at the beginning of the merger  leveraging the five key priorities below and building on the strong progress to date to drive a platform for growth 
first  we will continue to drive accelerated growth for coors light with new marketing and sales programs 
coors light commands approximately two thirds of the light beer category in canada and is now our largest brand in canada  just ahead of molson canadian 
this brand grew at a double digit rate in and is our main growth engine in canada 
second  we are making progress in stabilizing our overall volume and share trends for our other core mainstream brands  in particular molson canadian 
our strategies in this area began to show results by the th quarter of as our supported brands experienced volume and share growth 
after increasing marketing investment behind the molson canadian brand substantially in  we intend to maintain a competitive investment level for this critical brand going forward 
third  to drive volume growth  we are leveraging the strength of our world class  partner brand import portfolio  which includes heineken  corona and miller genuine draft 
these brands grew at significant rates in and will again benefit from new  innovative programming this year 
fourth  we have adjusted our value segment strategies to regain lost volume and reduce the rate of trading down by consumers 
we began to see positive results from these strategies in the second half of  but we have more work to do 
stabilizing pricing will also be a key issue for molson and the industry in fifth  we continue to focus on reducing costs to deliver the canada related merger cost synergies 
through our initiatives  we will work to offset cost of goods inflation  specifically the costs of distribution  energy  and input materials  which remain near historical high levels 
sales trade investment  in particular the qu bec market  is a potential area of profit pressure if trade cost escalation continues to far exceed inflation 
meanwhile  we expect to limit general and administrative increases to less than inflationary levels 
europe segment the competitive environment in the uk beer industry continues to be challenging  driving our focus is on two main strategies 
first  we are implementing cost reduction initiatives  especially related to overhead and supply chain costs 
while these cost improvements were implemented in the latter part of and were not enough to offset all of the margin loss that our europe business sustained in the past year  we believe that these aggressive improvements will help this business return to a solid earnings growth trend 
second  we will continue to invest heavily behind our core lager brands carling  grolsch and coors fine light 
the carling brand has been consistently strong  growing market share every year for more than a decade and now represents three fourths of our europe volume 
because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of the europe reporting unit  its fair value was compared to its carrying value in to determine if there was a risk of goodwill impairment 
the goodwill associated with the europe reporting unit originated in the purchase of the cbl business by coors 
a reduction in the fair value of the europe reporting unit in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment 
we noted a reduction in the value of the europe reporting unit from to  but not enough of a decrease to warrant a goodwill impairment 
future reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons  including cost increases due to inflation  a negative beer pricing environment  and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales 
corporate we expect general and administrative costs to be lower in  because we experienced significant one time costs related to the formation of the new global organization and headquarters  and significant legal fees associated with regulatory and shareholder civil actions in higher expected costs associated with incentive compensation  including costs for stock based compensation  may offset these anticipated cost savings 
goodwill because there is goodwill included in the carrying value of our three segments  its fair value was compared to its carrying value in to determine whether there was a risk of goodwill impairment 
most of the goodwill associated with the us and canada segments originated in the merger 
canada s goodwill was determined through purchase accounting  requiring the purchase consideration to be allocated to molson s assets and liabilities based upon their fair values  with the residual to goodwill 
a portion of the merger goodwill was allocated to the us segment  based on the level of merger synergy savings expected to accrue to the us segment over time 
a reduction in the fair value of the us or canada segment in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment 
reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons  including cost increases due to inflation  a negative beer pricing environment  declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales  or the inability to achieve synergies from the merger 
the goodwill associated with the europe segment originated in the purchase of the cbl business by coors 
a reduction in the fair value of the europe segment in the future could lead to a goodwill impairment 
we noted a reduction in the value of the europe segment from to  but not enough of a decrease to warrant a goodwill impairment 
future reductions in fair value could occur for a number of reasons  including cost increases due to inflation  a negative beer pricing environment  and declines in industry or company specific beer volume sales 
interest we estimate that corporate interest expense in will be approximately million per quarter with the brazil debt now removed from our balance sheet 
note that this excludes uk trade loan interest income 
stock compensation for molson coors  as with many large companies  stock based long term incentive compensation will be an incremental expense starting in due to the new accounting guidelines around stock options  effective in the first quarter combined with a re design of our long term incentive plan  we anticipate that this new accounting guidance will result in about million million annualized of increased expense in versus less than of this increased expense will be directly related to new accounting rules that will be applied to the stock option grant  expected to occur in mid march  which will involve approximately  shares or about one sixth the size of the option grant 
additionally  the new restricted and performance share programs will involve only about  shares per year 
approximately  of these shares will be awarded under the restricted stock unit program 
equally important  more than  of these new incentive shares will be awarded only if the company achieves strong profit performance during the next few years 
tax we anticipate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the range of to 
it is important to note that the adoption of a permanent investment strategy for our uk business last year pursuant to apb  provided a one time benefit and lowered our tax rate  which will not recur in cash flow and liquidity we anticipate total company capital spending of approximately million 
this is higher than due to completing our virginia brewery build out and merger related capital projects 
after this year  in the absence of major capacity projects  we expect capital spending to drop to the low millions for the total company 
one of our goals for is to generate more than million of free cash flow available for debt repayments  including million of cash proceeds from the brazil business sale 
it is important to note that some of the drivers of our free cash flow may not reoccur in  including working capital timing  option exercises and asset monetizations which  taken together  totaled more than million in our merger related special dividend debt balance stood at million at the beginning of we plan to use our free cash to pay off the special dividend debt by some time this summer  which is well ahead of our original timeline 
we anticipate increasing our free cash generation goal again in as we complete the construction of our virginia brewery and realize more merger cost synergies

once an entity is determined to be a vie  the party with the controlling financial interest  the primary beneficiary  is required to consolidate it

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
we review our accounting policies on an on going basis 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  estimates are subject to uncertainty 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations allowance for doubtful accounts in the us segment  our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant 
the majority of the us segment accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer 
also  in the us segment  we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds  personal guarantees and other letters of credit 
because the majority of cbl sales are directly to retail customers and  because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers  our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical 
we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers 
generally  provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage at the point the account is considered uncollectible 
we record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses 
provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off 
canada s distribution channels are highly regulated by provincial regulation and experiences few collectibility problems 
however  canada does have direct sales to retail customers for which an allowance is recorded based upon aging analysis and historical experience 
we are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and  if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be adversely affected  and we may be required to record additional allowances 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
we also have postretirement welfare plans in the united states and canada that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees 
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 

both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses  salary increases  inflation  health care cost trend rates and other assumptions 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions 
we performed an analysis of high yield bonds at the end of and compared the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in the united states  canada and in the united kingdom for the year ended december  discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year and impact expense in the subsequent year 
a fifty basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of would have had the following effects on pension expense impact to pension costs basis points description of pension sensitivity item reduction unfavorable increase favorable in millions expected return on us plan assets  in expected return on uk plan assets  in expected return on canada plan assets  in discount rate on us projected benefit obligation  in discount rate on uk projected benefit obligation  in discount rate on canada projected benefit obligation  in assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point increase unfavorable one percentage point decrease favorable in millions us plan effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation canada plans effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation the us  europe and canada plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds  real estate and other investments 
equity assets are well diversified between domestic and other international investments  with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large cap  small cap  and growth and value investments 
relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants 
the following compares target asset allocation percentages as of february   with actual asset allocations at december  us plan assets europe plan assets canada plan assets target allocations actual allocations target allocations actual allocations target allocations actual allocations equities fixed income real estate other contingencies  environmental and litigation reserves we estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to any pending matter and revise our estimates 
costs that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
we also expense legal costs as incurred 
see note to the accompanying financial statements on page for a discussion of the company s contingencies  environmental and litigation reserves at december  there are large numbers of contingent tax liabilities are associated with our discontinued operations in brazil 
our approach in estimating loss contingencies for these items generally did not contemplate or anticipate negotiated resolutions or government sponsored amnesty programs which  when they occur  may apply to all companies in brazil or whichever state in brazil is assessing the tax when setting our reserves for cases where a loss was considered probable 
in effect  if a loss was considered probable  it was reserved at the assessed amount 
this also applied where the nature of the challenge was constitutional  ie  if kaiser and other companies had been assessed taxes but were challenging the assessment based on the legal merits of the tax law itself  a full reserve was maintained and any successful outcome in the future would be recognized only when realized 
penalties on brazil tax liabilities have potentially wide ranges  and we estimated the levels of penalties based on past experience and consultations with outside counsel on a case by case basis 
we sold of the kaiser business in january while we greatly reduced our risk profile as a result of this transaction  we retained some level of risk by providing indemnities to the buyer for certain purchased tax credits and for other tax  labor and civil contingencies in general 
these are discussed in the section called contingencies above 
we will account for these indemnity obligations at fair value in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this rule requires us to carry the guarantee liability on the balance sheet at its fair value 
we do not expect to amortize this liability  but rather make an annual estimate of its fair value  and record the change in the value through discontinued operations on the income statement if it is material 
if we conclude that we have to make payments on an indemnity provision and therefore the obligation converts to a monetary contingent liability  we will record the income statement charge through discontinued operations again  if material 
goodwill and other intangible asset valuation we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  and we evaluate our other intangible assets when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment  most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets and the rate used to discount those cash flows 
our projections are based on various long range plans completed by the company and considered  when necessary  various scenarios deviating from a base case  both favorable and unfavorable 
discount rates used for enterprise value estimates for goodwill testing ranged from for canada to for the united states and europe 
canada represents our most profitable reporting unit  with the highest market share 
our us  canada and uk segments operate in relatively mature beer markets  where we are reliant on a major brand for a high percentage of sales 
discount rates used for testing of indefinite lived intangibles ranged form for canada core brands  for our coors light distribution intangible in canada  to for the carling brand in the united kingdom 
these rates largely reflect the rates for the overall enterprise valuations  with some level of premium associated with the specificity of the intangibles themselves 
changes in these estimates could have an adverse impact on the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  thereby requiring us to impair the assets 
we have allocated approximately billion of goodwill from the merger to the us reporting unit 
we have done this allocation to more accurately allocate the goodwill to the reporting units that are expected to realize the synergy savings that will result from the merger 
it should be noted that this allocation of goodwill puts added pressure on the us business to achieve synergy savings to avoid an impairment of goodwill 
there is also some level of impairment risk in and beyond associated with goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the united kingdom  given financial performance in the europe reporting unit  and with the non amortized core brands intangible in canada  given the potential for inconsistent growth patterns and pricing for those brands 
derivatives and other financial instruments the following tables present a roll forward of the fair values of debt and derivative contracts outstanding as well as their maturity dates and how those fair values were obtained in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at december   contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period  other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at december   fair value of contracts at december  source of fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted   prices provided by other external sources we use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
by policy  we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation 
all derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures 
we account for our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  incorporating fasb statements no 
 and sfas no 
 which we early adopted on december  such accounting is complex  as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard  which continues to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances  however  the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  commodity swaps  interest rate swaps  and cross currency swaps 
see discussions also in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note on page we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using two techniques value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
we use value at risk to monitor the foreign exchange and interest rate risk of our cross currency swaps 
the value at risk provides an estimate of the level of a one day loss that may be equaled or exceeded due to changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the type of value at risk model used to estimate the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value is a variance covariance method 
the value at risk model assumes normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used to compute value at risk 
the computations used to derive our values take into account various correlations between currency rates and interest rates 
the correlations have been determined by observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the most recent one year period 
we have excluded anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the value at risk calculation  some of which these instruments are intended to hedge 
the value at risk calculation is a statistical measure of risk exposure based on probabilities and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we may incur 
the calculated value at risk result does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
it attempts to represent the most likely measure of potential loss that may be experienced times out of due to adverse market events that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by value at risk because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments  hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our cross currency swaps  derived using the value at risk model  was million  million and million at december   december   and december   respectively 
such a hypothetical loss in fair value is a combination of the foreign exchange and interest rate components of the cross currency swap 
value changes due to the foreign exchange component would be offset completely by increases in the value of our inter company loan  the underlying transaction being hedged 
the hypothetical loss in fair value attributable to the interest rate component would be deferred until termination or maturity 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the applicable market interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the volatility of the applicable rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecast with reliable accuracy 
therefore  actual changes in fair values could differ significantly from the results presented in the table below 
the following table presents the results of the sensitivity analysis  which reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in the applicable market interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices of our derivative and debt portfolio as of estimated fair value volatility december  december  in millions foreign currency risk forwards  swaps interest rate risk debt  swaps commodity price risk swaps income tax assumptions we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we have historically provided us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
during  we assessed our corporate financing position with respect to all our foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  we have elected to treat our portion of all foreign subsidiary earnings through december  as permanently reinvested 
under the accounting guidance of apb and sfas  we recorded a tax provision benefit in the third quarter of totaling million  representing the reversal of a previously established deferred tax liability in our uk subsidiary 
as of december   approximately million of retained earnings attributable to international companies was considered to be permanently re invested 
the company s intention is to reinvest the earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings when it is tax effective to do so 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of incremental taxes that might arise were these earnings to be remitted 
however  the company believes that us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us taxes and offset any foreign withholding taxes due on remittance 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the jobs act provided a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out of the existing extra territorial income exclusion eti for foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade protocols by the european union 
the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction did not materially impact the company s effective tax rate in in addition to the deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  the jobs act also creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations  which resulted in the company not recognizing a benefit from this provision of the jobs act 
the fasb is currently considering changes to accounting for uncertain tax positions 
because the nature and extent of the changes are not fully known we are not able to predict the impact on our tax contingency reserve  if any 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
reductions to the valuation allowance related to the merger with molson or the acquisitions of cbl that relate to deferred taxes arising from those events would reduce goodwill  unless the reduction was caused by a change in law  in which case the adjustment would impact earnings 
during  in connection with the purchase of cbl  we recorded a deferred tax liability on the books of cbl and a corresponding deferred tax asset on the books of the acquiring company for the difference between the purchase price and historical basis of the cbl assets 
concurrently  we recorded a million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the company re evaluated the purchase accounting and determined that recording this deferred tax asset was not appropriate as it did not represent either a tax carry forward or a difference in the book and tax bases of the net assets at the time the purchase accounting adjustments were recorded 
the impact of the misstatement on the company s balance sheet was an overstatement of the long term deferred tax asset account of million  with a corresponding understatement of goodwill of million at december  the impact of this misstatement was not material to the consolidated balance sheets for december  this error resulted in immaterial misstatements in the company s reported income tax provision for the year ended december  see item a on page consolidations under fin r rmmc and rmbc are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses 
the cbl joint venture with grolsch was formed to provide a long term relationship with that brand s owner in a key segment of the uk beer market 
in  our share of the pre tax joint venture profits for each of these investments was offset against cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
in  as a result of implementing fin r  these entities have been consolidated into our consolidated financial statements as we have determined they are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary 
we also consolidate the financial position and results of brewers retail  inc bri  which is owned by molson  and provides all distribution and retail sales of beer in the province of ontario in canada 
we have examined another potential business relationship during when implementing fin r 
this is the relationship we have with trigen  the supplier of virtually all our energy needs at our golden facility 
trigen purchased our power plant facilities in and signed a contract to provide our energy needs in golden 
we do not own any portion of the trigen entity  but upon review of the supply contract  we believe that the relationship could be viewed as a variable interest  as defined by fin r 
however  despite exhaustive efforts to obtain financial information necessary to proceed with the analysis  we have been unable to obtain the information from trigen  which cites privacy and competitive issues with releasing this financial information 
we purchase approximately million of energy each year from trigen 
we have determined that any risk of a material loss is remote and that our total maximum loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
we do not have another readily available option to obtain the steam energy required to run our plant 
we could incur operational losses should we be unable to purchase steam from trigen  and we are unable to estimate any such losses 
in addition  we have a non cancelable obligation to pay trigen fixed costs through the remainder of the contract 
the costs are adjusted annually for inflation and were approximately million in we currently purchase some of our electricity requirements from another supplier at rates that do not significantly differ from the rates we pay trigen 
our risk of loss relating to the difference in price from having to buy electricity from another third party rather than from trigen is not significant 
in the event that trigen failed to perform its contractual obligations  mcbc has the right to step in and operate the power plant facilities 
this circumstance would involve mcbc repurchasing the power plant assets  a cost that could be borne with mcbc s current capital resources 
adoption of new accounting pronouncement fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
specifically  fin provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and or method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair market value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
we adopted fin on december   which resulted in an increase to properties of million  goodwill of million and liabilities of million related to asset retirement obligations 
for asset retirement obligations related to the properties acquired in the acquisition of molson inc as of february   such obligations increased the goodwill amounts recognized upon the acquisition by million as such properties were recorded at the appraised fair market value at the acquisition date 
these asset retirement obligations relate primarily to clean up  removal  or replacement activities and related costs for asbestos  coolants  waste water  oils and other contaminants contained within our manufacturing properties 
the adoption of fin was reflected in our financial statements as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle with the catch up adjustment of million  net of tax benefit of million  in the income statement 
this adjustment represents a depreciation charge and an accretion of liability from the time the obligation originated  which is either from the time of the acquisition or the construction of related long lived assets  through december  inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the asset balance 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss upon the settlement 
the net value of the asset retirement obligation liabilities calculated on a pro forma basis as if the standard had been retrospectively applied to all periods presented are as follows december  december  december  new accounting pronouncements sfas r  share based payment statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas no 
r was issued in december and will be effective for us in the first quarter of sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation in the financial statements based on their fair values 
currently  under an exemption written into the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant  we present pro forma share based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements 
we have elected to use the modified prospective transition method of implementing sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  awards that are granted  modified  or settled after adoption of sfas r are prospectively measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the adoption of sfas r should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r 
in particular  sab provides supplemental implementation guidance on sfas r  including guidance on valuation methods  classification of compensation expense  inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost  income tax effects  disclosures in management s discussion and analysis and several other issues 
we will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted in and will amortize the expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we expect to use lattice modeling to determine our expected term assumption 
other equity instruments issued as compensation will be valued based upon the market price of our stock on the date of grant and will be amortized on a straight line basis over their earnings periods 
the pro forma disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item on page illustrate the approximate impact of applying sfas r to the historical periods presented 
however  the historical period presented includes the effects of the accelerated vesting of all outstanding  but unvested stock options on the date of our merger million and the accelerated vesting of all outstanding  but unvested stock options with exercise prices above approved by our board of directors in december million 
the board action in december  while serving to reduce future stock option amortization expense as a result of adoption of sfas r  will be partially offset by new issuances of equity instruments to employees in we are finalizing our first quarter option expense calculations and do not yet know the impact to our income statement

 chapter that will be effective for us in fiscal the standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage to require that those costs be expensed currently  as opposed to being included in overhead costs

 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas no 
was issued in february and will be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
among other things  sfas no

we are still reviewing the impact that sfas no 
will have on our financial statements

fin is an amendment to fin requiring the recognition and disclosure of the fair value of an obligation undertaken for minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners that the revenue of the business for a specified period of time will be at least a specified minimum amount 
the fsp is effective for new minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after the beginning of the first quarter we do not anticipate that the adoption will have a significant impact on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currencies and the prices of production and packaging materials 
we have established policies and procedures to govern the strategic management of these exposures through a variety of financial instruments 
by policy  we do not enter into any contracts for the purpose of trading or speculation 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  commodity swaps  interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps  the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows 
we do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign currency denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
our primary foreign currency exposures are canadian dollar cdn  british pound sterling gbp or and japanese yen yen 
derivatives are either exchange traded instruments  or over the counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions 
no losses on over the counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated 
all over the counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than a s p or a moody s 
in some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds 
these agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash  treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount 
at december   no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us 
details of all other market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  including their fair values  are included in the table below 
these instruments include long term fixed rate debt  foreign currency forwards  commodity swaps  interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps 
see related value at risk and sensitivity analysis on page expected maturity date december thereafter total fair value long term debt in thousands us million  fixed rate  due cdn million  fixed rate  due us million  fixed rate  due  cdn million  fixed rate  due foreign currency management in thousands forwards    cross currency swaps    commodity pricing management swaps     interest rate pricing management interest rate swaps   we are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling million approximately us million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in  the year we entered into the swaps 
the swaps included an initial exchange of principal in and will require final principal exchange on the settlement date of our notes due in see note on page 
the swaps also call for an exchange of fixed gbp interest payments for fixed us interest receipts 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us to a counterparty and received gbp 
upon final exchange  we will provide gbp to the counterparty and receive us 
the cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future gbp interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us to gbp exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries 
prior to issuing the bonds on september  see note on page  we entered into a bond forward transaction for a portion of the canadian offering 
the bond forward transaction effectively established  in advance  the yield of the government of canada bond rates over which the company s private placement was priced 
at the time of the private placement offering and pricing  the government of canada bond rates was trading at a yield lower than that locked in with the company s interest rate lock 
this resulted in a loss of million on the bond forward transaction 
per fas accounting  the loss will be amortized over the life of the canadian issued private placement and will serve to increase the company s effective cost of borrowing by basis points compared to the stated coupon on the issue 
simultaneously with the us private placement we entered into a cross currency swap transaction for the entire us million issue amount and for the same maturity 
in this transaction we exchanged our us million for a cdn million obligation with a third party 
the terms of the transaction are such that the company will pay interest at a rate of to the third party on the amount of cdn million and will receive interest at a rate of on the us million amount 
there was an exchange of principal at the inception of this transaction and there will be a subsequent exchange of principal at the termination of the transaction 
we have designated this transaction as a hedge of the variability of the cash flows associated with the payment of interest and principal on the us securities 
consistent with fas accounting  all changes in the value of the transaction due to foreign exchange will be recorded through the statement of income and will be offset by a revaluation of the associated debt instrument 
changes in the value of the transaction due to interest rates will be recorded to other comprehensive income 
we are a party to a cross currency swap totaling cdn million approximately us million at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates in  the year we entered into the swap 
the swap included an initial exchange of principal in and matures in the swap also calls for an exchange of fixed cdn interest payments for fixed us interest receipts 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us to a counterparty and received cdn 
upon final exchange  we will provide cdn to the counterparty and receive us 
the cross currency swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the changes in value of the future cdn interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us to cdn exchange rates on an intercompany loan between two of our subsidiaries 
see accounting method discussion in note on page to the accompanying financial statements 
we are a party to interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt 
the interest rate swaps convert million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in we will receive fixed us interest payments semi annually at a rate of per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three month libor rate  thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating rate obligation 
there was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps 
we designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of the changes in the fair value of million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the libor swap rates 
see accounting method discussion in note on page to the accompanying financial statements 
the bri joint venture is a party to interest rate swaps  converting cdn million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in there was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps 
these interest rate swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
