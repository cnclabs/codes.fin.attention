item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading producer of a variety of products and services for diverse market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group  engraving group  hydraulics products group and engineered products group 
because these segments serve different markets  the performance of each is affected by different external and economic factors 
we believe that our diversification has helped to reduce the cyclicality of earnings that affects many companies that focus principally on only one or two market segments 
therefore  we intend to continue to operate in selected market segments that may not directly relate to one another 
however  through our focused diversity strategy  we are seeking to build those businesses which offer the best opportunities for future growth and profitability  through both organic growth and acquisitions 
as part of our strategy  we are focusing our resources on those businesses where synergies can be leveraged to enhance the performance of the individual businesses 
consistent with this strategy  we committed to a plan to divest the businesses within the consumer products group 
the businesses of the group include standard publishing  berean christian stores and standex direct 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of standex direct 
subsequent to fiscal  we completed the sale of the remaining two businesses 
during fiscal  we completed two acquisitions in furthering our strategy of growth in profitable businesses 
in november  we acquired substantially all the assets of kool star  a manufacturer of walk in refrigeration units located in california 
this bolt on acquisition will expand our refrigerated walk in cooler and freezer product line by providing improved access to the growing southwestern us market  where our presence has not been strong 
also in november  we completed the purchase of substantially all the assets of innovent specialty products  a manufacturer of processing tooling with locations in massachusetts and the netherlands 
innovent provides us access to complementary markets where the products and technology of our engraving group can be adapted 
we continue to pursue other acquisition opportunities 
in addition to our strategic objectives  we are seeking to reduce our operating costs through sourcing products and materials from china and other lower cost providers  transferring manufacturing activities to lower cost countries such as mexico and china  capital expenditures to increase automation and implementing lean enterprise throughout our production facilities 
during fiscal  we completed construction of a manufacturing facility in mexico and commenced manufacturing activities there in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
in china  we established two new manufacturing locations  one to capitalize on the market for the engraving group and the second to establish a lower cost assembly operation for the engineered products group  respectively 
we are expanding our manufacturing operations in mexico  both to take advantage of the lower operating costs there  which we expect will permit an improvement in profit margins on high volume  labor intensive products  and to better reach potential new customers and markets in california and the southwestern united states 
upon completion of the facility  we relocated manufacturing activities from two locations  one in tennessee and the other in colorado 
both properties were sold during fiscal year the costs to relocate these manufacturing activities have been included in restructuring expenses in the current year 
the company also relocated the manufacturing activities of kool star immediately following the close of that transaction 
during  we incurred costs of million in connection with the start up of production in mexico 
we anticipate that once the facility is fully operational  which we expect will occur by the end of fiscal  annual savings in the range of million to million will be realized 
there are a number of key external factors other than general business and economic conditions that can impact the performance of our businesses 
the key factors affecting each business are described below 
there are several items that affect the comparability of our performance information between the periods discussed in this report 
these items included the following we completed the construction of a manufacturing facility in mexico and three of our businesses have commenced operations at the mexican facility 
we incurred costs of million in connection with the start up of the operations 
during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring costs of  in connection with activities primarily associated with the relocation of manufacturing activities to mexico 
we completed two acquisitions in november for million 
these acquisitions were incorporated into the performance of the food service equipment and engraving groups and resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill 
we completed the sale of two properties in the quarter ended december  resulting in the recognition of gains of approximately  recorded in other operating income expense 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  and recorded incremental equity based compensation totaling in fiscal we committed to a plan to dispose of the businesses within the consumer products group 
the results of operations for these businesses and any gains from the completion of the sale of one of the businesses are classified as discontinued operations in this report 
in fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell the useco product lines of the food service equipment group 
the results of operations for this business and a pre tax charge of million recorded in connection with the write down of the carrying cost of inventory have been classified as discontinued operations in this report 
in fiscal  pre tax restructuring charges of million were recognized associated with various exit activities including charges associated with severance and an impairment charge in connection with the closure of a manufacturing plant in our adp group and the decision to sell the real property 
in fiscal  pre tax restructuring charges of million were recognized in connection with the consolidation of two facilities 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin other operating income restructuring expense income from operations backlog net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales growth net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
the two acquisitions completed in fiscal added million while the effect of exchange rates reduced sales by  the remaining sales increase of million represents organic growth 
organic sales are defined as sales from businesses which were included in our results for both the current reporting period and the same period of the previous year  and include the effect of price changes 
the increase in organic sales growth was led by businesses within the food service equipment  engraving and hydraulics products groups 
price increases accounted for over of the organic growth with the remainder due to volume increases 
a further discussion by segment follows 
net sales from continuing operations increased million in fiscal year  an increase over fiscal year acquisitions added million in sales in while exchange rates favorably impacted sales by million 
after taking these into account  organic sales increased million 
the increase in organic sales occurred across all of our segments 
price increases accounted for approximately of the organic sales growth while the remainder was due to volume improvements 
a further discussion by segment follows 
gross profit margin our consolidated gross profit margin improved approximately basis points to in fiscal from in the increase is attributable to significant improvements in the air distribution products adp group  resulting from a combination of price increases and lower steel prices 
the margin improvement in the adp group was partially offset by reduced margins in the engineered products group 
the reduction was attributable to the favorable impact on margins in of the renegotiation of a long term supply contract discussed further below 
margins within the remaining operating segments were largely unchanged from the prior year 
our consolidated gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal year from in the decline was attributable primarily to the adp group  and was largely due to the fact that price increases obtained by adp were not sufficient to offset the significantly higher price of steel  a key component of adp s products  in in addition  margins in the engraving group improved year over year  due to increased volume and to efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of the group s rochester  new york facility into the richmond  virginia facility 
margins in our other segments were substantially unchanged from in the food service equipment group  increased sales of lower margin products were offset by price increases and a strong performance by the nor lake business unit 
other operating income expense and restructuring the company includes restructuring charges and certain other operating expenses and income as separate line items 
other operating income expense includes gains or losses on the sale of real property 
we incurred restructuring costs during fiscal of  compared to million in the prior year 
during fiscal  we built a manufacturing facility in mexico 
the restructuring costs in the current year were due to the relocation of two us plants  one in the food service equipment group and one in the adp group  to the new manufacturing facility in mexico 
the sale of the two closed us locations resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately  which was offset by  in losses on the disposition of excess operational assets within various segments 
the diversity of our business portfolio and our commitment to reducing operating costs makes it likely that the company will incur costs from time to time that  in accordance with current accounting standards  will be classified as restructuring 
during fiscal  we incurred restructuring and impairment costs of approximately million  pre tax  compared to million in the prior year 
of this amount  approximately million was associated with the closure of a plant in the adp group  while the remainder was largely associated with the consolidation of the rochester  new york facility of the engraving group into our richmond  virginia location 
during fiscal  we recorded gains on the sale of assets held for sale of approximately million compared to gains on the sale of property of  in the period one year earlier 
the gains in fiscal were primarily attributable to the sale of the land and building in rochester  new york 
income from operations income from operations increased million in fiscal  an increase over fiscal both the adp and engraving groups had double digit increases fueling the consolidated improvement 
these positive performances were offset by declines in the food service equipment and engineered products groups 
a further discussion is included in the segment discussions that follow 
in fiscal  income from operations increased million  a increase over fiscal four out of the five segments posted double digit increases 
adp was the exception  reporting a year over year decline in operating income 
a further discussion is included in the segment discussions that follow 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended june  was an increase of basis points from in the prior year 
the increase is largely attributable to the reduction in qualified research and development activities and the expiration of the federal research and development credit on december  our effective income tax rate for the year ended june  was an increase of basis points from in fiscal the fiscal rate included a settlement  net of related fees  of  associated with a multi year research and development credit 
the rate includes additional benefits realized upon the completion of our tax returns for fiscal reflecting additional tax credits as well as a decrease in the effective foreign income tax rate when compared to the same period in fiscal capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in fiscal  we spent million  an increase of million when compared to one year earlier  primarily due to the million spent for the new manufacturing facility in mexico 
capital expenditures for were million 
this represented an increase of million in  or  over backlog backlog for fiscal improved million  a increase from the prior year 
increased order activity within the engraving products and engineered products groups led the improvement 
within the food service equipment segment  the refrigerated walk in and cabinet businesses experienced decreases from the prior year for the year ended june   backlog increased million  a increase from the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the increased orders in the food service equipment group associated with several national accounts as well as other improvements in the remaining units due to increased activity in their respective markets 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group hydraulics products group engineered products food service equipment net sales increased by million  a increase when compared to fiscal acquisitions accounted for million of the increase while unfavorable exchange rates reduced sales by  excluding those items  sales increased million  or 
volume improvements in certain core products including refrigerated walk in and cabinet units led the overall increase in sales while price increases in a number of the products offered by the food service equipment group fseg also contributed to the increase when compared to fiscal during fiscal  fseg continued penetrating dealer buying groups serving the foodservice markets 
during the second half of the year  our brands sold well through this type of sales channel 
the sales improvement for fseg came during a period of transition  with the closure and relocation to mexico of our pump manufacturing activi ties and the manufacturing activities of kool star  the acquisition made in november these moves necessitated fseg  especially our pump business  to focus on the manufacture and delivery of beverage pumps causing some reduction in sales in pumps for commercial applications when compared to the same period one year earlier 
net sales increased by million in when compared to  a increase 
acquisitions accounted for million of this increase 
favorable exchange rates  primarily among the us dollar  the euro and the british pound  resulted in an increase to sales of million 
excluding these impacts  net sales increased million  or 
this increase was fueled by strong performances of the commercial refrigeration  hot food equipment and fluid dispensing and circulating systems businesses 
the improved performance of the commercial refrigeration business was due primarily to high demand and  to a lesser extent  to price increases implemented since last year 
the hot food preparation equipment improvement was due to increased supermarket store sales of rotisserie and combi ovens in europe  where the merger of two supermarket chains provided a significant r etrofitting opportunity 
sales of the beverage pump units remained strong and diversification into commercial applications  including welding  pesticide and other industrial applications  added to the unit s growth 
sales of pumps to these sectors increased and  respectively  over the prior year 
sales of fseg s other products were largely unchanged from those noted in the prior year 
air distribution products net sales in fiscal were relatively flat when compared to the same period one year earlier  decreasing  or a change from the prior year levels 
the decrease is a combination of decreased volume with product price increases during the year 
the volume decline can be largely attributed to the slow down in housing starts and permits in the geographical regions served by our plants 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the air distribution products group adp closed one of its manufacturing facilities located in colorado and relocated the manufacturing activities to the new facility in mexico 
through this move  adp will be better able to serve the fast growing housing market in the southwestern us net sales increased by million in  a increase over price increases totaling approximately that were implemented in the last two quarters of fiscal were responsible for all of the increase 
these increases were implemented to offset the dramatically higher costs paid by the segment for galvanized steel  a significant component of the segment s operating costs 
net of those price increases  real unit volume was down when compared to the prior year 
the decline was due largely to the fact that sales in were positively impacted by customer buying in advance of announced price increases 
the group s business correlates to housing starts in the regions in which the group operates  which on a proportionate basis were flat from to engraving group net sales increased million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase while favorable exchange rates added an additional  the remaining increase of million was attributable to strong demand within the group s mold texturization business  especially from its automotive customers 
the automotive business benefited in from a large number of interior and exterior redesigns that many automotive manufacturers performed during the fiscal year in response to customer demands for a wider variety of choice 
the mold texturization business also grew internationally  especially in china  where the engraving group has decided to open an additional operation in central china  in the first quarter of fiscal to complement the existing facility in southern china 
the positive sales performance of the mold texturization business was offset by declines in the engraving group s other two businesses  roll and plate engraving and embossing equipment 
many of the customers served by these businesses  including consumer and building products suppliers  reduced their orders in net sales increased by million in  or over favorable exchange rates accounted for million of the sales increase in the remainder of the sales increased million  or in fiscal the increase was attributable to strong demand within all three of the engraving group s business areas mold texturization  roll and plate engraving  and embossing equipment 
the mold texturization business was positively impacted by strong automotive program work worldwide 
the embossing business benefited from the introduction of machinery and rolls that improve the cosmetic appeal and utility of consumer products 
roll and plate engraving received increased orders from several larger industrial companies for laminating rollers and leather embossing plates 
the majority of the sales increases noted above occurred in the us  mexico  brazil and china  while european operations reported an increase in sales of year over year 
hydraulics products group net sales increased by million  or over fiscal this increase was all organic  brought about by increases in volume and  to a lesser extent  price increases 
sales increases were most noticeable in the dump truck and trailer industry served by the group 
market share gains in the us  significant order activity in the north american market and increased penetration into europe and asia have contributed to the increased sales when compared to fiscal in fiscal  net sales increased by million  or over this increase in sales reflected a stronger core market for telescoping hydraulic cylinders for the dump truck and trailer industry 
in addition  lean manufacturing initiatives in the us unit have helped to improve the unit s cycle times  deliveries and throughputs  allowing the unit to better serve our customers 
engineered products net sales decreased million  or  when compared to fiscal in fiscal  the metal fabrication business renegotiated a supply arrangement with a large aerospace customer which resulted in a reduced sales volume under the arrangement in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result  sales of the metal fabrication business decreased million year over year in the metal fabrication business 
this decrease was partially offset by improved sales volume for energy and other aerospace projects 
sales of electronic components were consistent with levels in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we established a new manufacturing operation in northern china for electronic components to better serve existing customers who have relocated to china 
net sales increased by million in  or over the increase was largely attributable to organic sales growth  and to a lesser extent  the impact of the acquisitions in and favorable currency translation adjustments 
sales of electronic components increased million in fiscal  helped by increased sales of fluid level and other pressure indicators for the automotive industry 
sales within the metal fabrication units increased million  due largely to sales of new and aftermarket turbine engine components for the energy sector 
sales within the aerospace sector finished slightly ahead of levels 
sales in aviation were consistent with those noted in the prior year as the sector benefited from the expansion of smaller regional jets 
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving group hydraulics products engineered products restructuring other expenses  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment performance decreased million in fiscal  an decline from fiscal the decline can be attributed to several factors 
first  the relocation of the pump manufacturing operations to the new facility in mexico resulted in start up costs and related inefficiencies of million 
second the shutdown and relocation to mexico of our newly acquired kool star business resulted in higher shipping  labor and travel costs of  third  fseg was affected by a combination of sales mix changes when compared to the prior year  increased buying group activity at lower margins as well as material cost increases in excess of price increases 
many of the materials used in our refrigerated products  such as steel  foam insulation and copper  have experienced price increases and fluctuations throughout the fiscal year due to worldwide dema nd and other market forces 
during fiscal  fseg implemented price increases to partially offset the higher material costs 
income from operations increased by million in  a increase over the increase is attributable to two principal factors 
first  our nor lake brand of refrigeration products reported sales volume gains  a favorable sales mix resulting from increased sales of higher margin scientific refrigerated products  and significant expense reductions as a result of the implementation of cost control measures 
second  income from operations of hot food preparation equipment sales increased more than from the prior year 
these increases were offset by a reduction in income from operations within our remaining commercial refrigeration and display businesses  the combined operating income of which declined approximately 
price increases were implemented during the year  but they were not sufficient to fully offset material cost increases 
steel  refrigeration compo nents and foam insulation are significant elements of the cost structure of refrigerated cabinets and freezers  and prices of all of those items increased significantly during the year 
air distribution products income from operations increased million in fiscal  or 
the improvement is attributable to price increases in advance of material cost increases 
adp procures a significant amount of steel from a foreign source  with generally lower prices and longer lead times than are offered by local sources 
the increase included approximately  in start up related costs associated with our relocation of manufacturing activities to the new facility in mexico 
the company expects to benefit in fiscal from the geographical proximity of this facility to the housing markets in the southwestern us we believe that a continued softening in the residential housing market is likely 
adp was the only segment which reported a decrease in year over year operating income from fiscal to fiscal income from operations decreased million  or over that period 
this segment implemented price increases of approximately in fiscal to offset increases in the price of steel 
these price increases significantly mitigated  but did not fully offset the total cost increase 
further  adp experienced volume decreases  which affected operating income 
engraving group income from operations increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
a combination of the acquisition of innovent in november and sales increases contributed to the improvement in income from operations 
with the higher volume of mold texturization business in fiscal combined with technology improvements  the engraving group was able to gain efficiencies while increasing output 
this was most noticeable in our international operations  the year over year income from operations which increased over due largely to the automotive demand of the mold texturization business 
these positive performances were partially offset by sale volume decreases in the roll engraving and embossing machinery businesses 
in fiscal  the engraving group benefited from increased embossing machinery orders that did not repeat in fiscal due to softening ma rkets 
income from operations rose by million in  a increase over  reflecting strong sales performance throughout the segment  and the cost savings and synergies realized by the consolidation of the segment s rochester  new york and richmond  virginia facilities 
hydraulics products income from operations increased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the hydraulics products group hydraulics was able to leverage the increase in sales volume without increasing costs incrementally 
during fiscal  hydraulics introduced several new products including a new cylinder designed for the european market to expand the geographical reach of hydraulics 
in connection with this introduction  additional costs were incurred including increased selling and marketing costs  increased distribution costs and other operating cost increases 
we believe that these costs represent a necessary investment in the introduction of a new product that is important to the continued growth of hydraulics 
income from operations increased million in fiscal  a improvement from fiscal the increase was attributable to the strong sales performance of the hydraulics core products and the ability of the business to leverage the increase in sales through cost containment and reduction activities 
engineered products income from operations decreased million in fiscal  a decline when compared to the same period one year earlier 
during fiscal  the electronics business experienced increases in material costs coupled with duplicative costs associated with restructuring activities undertaken during the year 
this business is in the process of consolidating two existing us locations into one  which will improve efficiency going forward 
in fiscal  however  the business found it necessary to hire and train a workforce to replace the workforce in the location being consolidated 
this resulted in increased headcount and inefficiencies in the manufacturing activities 
this business also undertook the relocation of manufacturing activities from our second mexico location to northern china  which resulted in cost increases due to travel 
the reduction in overhead costs and the lower operating costs associated with the move to china are expected to improve the performance of the electronics business in fiscal  especially in the second half of the year once all relocation activities have been completed 
during fiscal  our metal spinning and fabrication businesses experienced a modest decline in income from operations 
the decline is largely attributable to the favorable adjustment received in fiscal from the renegotiation of a long term supply contract with a major aerospace customer 
this decline was partially offset by improved margins within several core products for energy and aerospace industries 
this business continues to diversify with a focus on the general aviation and energy industries 
income from operations of the engineered products group increased million in year over year  or 
income from operations of the metal spinning and fabrication units in was approximately the same as in a reduction in operating income due to the fact that a higher percentage of the unit s sales in were of lower margin turbine engine components was offset by improved productivity and a favorable adjustment resulting from the renegotiation of a long term supply contract with a major aerospace customer 
these positives were offset by a decrease in income from operations within the electronics business 
this decrease was due primarily to increases in material costs 
corporate operating expenses for corporate increased million in fiscal  a increase when compared to the same period one year earlier 
in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
r  which resulted in an increase in compensation expense associated with equity based compensation of  plus an additional  in compensation for awards issued to retirement eligible employees 
expenses for corporate were otherwise largely unchanged 
reductions in professional fees incurred in fiscal associated with the sarbanes oxley act were offset by executive search fees incurred 
operating expenses for fiscal increased  or over the increase is primarily attributable to professional and audit fees associated with compliance work  and increased insurance costs 
to meet the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  we incurred costs for additional personnel to supplement existing staff levels within the internal audit function  as well as increased costs associated with the external audit of our financial statements 
external audit fees exceeded million in fiscal year  an increase of from the company is primarily self insured for health insurance and workers compensation coverage in the united states 
with the impact of medical inflation  as well as unfavorable trends experienced by us  additional expenses were incurred in fiscal these increased costs were largely offset by other cost reduction s in corporate operations 
acquisitions the company s growth is dependent not only on organic growth within our existing businesses  but also on the successful completion of acquisitions that align with our strategic goals 
the ability to complete these transactions is dependent upon a number of factors  including the acquisition multiples that the market is demanding  the synergies that can be realized  and the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
in fiscal  we completed two acquisitions 
substantially all the assets of three star manufacturing  inc dba kool star kool star were purchased in an all cash transaction 
kool star  with estimated annual sales of million  is a manufacturer of walk in cold storage units serving primarily the west coast and southwest portions of the united states 
this bolt on acquisition will expand our refrigerated walk in cooler and freezer product line by providing improved access to the growing southwestern us market where our presence has not been strong 
kool star has been integrated into the food service equipment segment 
the company also completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the innovent special products group innovent in an all cash transaction 
with manufacturing facilities in peabody  ma and venray  netherlands  innovent manufactures processing tooling critical to the manufacture of absorbent cores for child adult diapers  feminine hygiene products and medical under pads 
innovent provides us access to complementary markets where the products and technology of our engraving group can be adapted 
the innovent special products group is expected to generate more than million in revenue 
the innovent special products group has been integrated into the engraving group 
see the notes to consolidated financial statement for the summary of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisitions discontinued operations consumer products group during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of certain assets of the standex direct business of the consumer products group 
standex direct marketed and sold  through direct mail order distribution  internet sites and telemarketing  consumer specialty fruit  citrus and vegetable food products 
the company recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with the sale 
subsequent to year end  we completed the sale of the remaining businesses of the group 
the company has classified the results of operations of the consumer products group as discontinued operations in this report 
the company expects to recognize a gain of approximately million on these transactions 
useco in march  we entered into a plan to dispose of certain assets of our useco product lines 
useco  which is part of the food service equipment group  manufactures and sells rethermalization systems for meal deliveries to institutions  including governmental institutions  and under sink food disposals 
the company has determined that the product lines of useco do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the food service equipment group 
the company also determined that the markets that this business serves are not growing 
the company is actively marketing the businesses and has committed to a plan to sell the businesses of useco 
the company has classified the results of the operations of useco as discontinued operations in this report 
in fiscal  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the write down of the carrying cost of inventory 
other during fiscal  we recorded an additional  in costs associated with a business sold in our fiscal year several employees of the businesses who were terminated at the time of the sale filed workers compensation claims which we have determined will result in costs in excess of previously recorded estimates 
also during the fiscal year  we recorded an additional  in settlement costs for a product liability claim associated with a business sold in our fiscal both changes in estimates have been included in discontinued operations in fiscal year during fiscal year  we incurred a  charge in connection with the results of an environmental study completed on a building located in france 
this building was previously part of the keller dorian graveurs operation which was sold in fiscal see the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in june  the board of directors approved a plan to divest of the james burn international jbi subsidiary 
the company completed the sale effective september  and recorded additional charges in the first and second quarters of fiscal associated with this transaction 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from continuing operating activities and our revolving credit facility with nine banks 
in fiscal  continuing operations generated million of cash flow  compared to million in fiscal the increase is largely attributable to our decision to contribute million to the pension plans in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding pension contributions  cash flows from continuing operations decreased by million when comparing to the decrease is attributable to an increase in our working capital 
our net working capital  defined as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable  increased million when compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to increases in receivables and inventory to support the higher sales volumes which were offset by the increase in accounts payable 
in addition  the sale of certain real estate generated million of incremental cash during the year while discontinued operations generated million in cash primarily through the proceeds from the sale of standex direct of million 
we redeployed those resources by investing mill ion in cash for capital expenditures  returning million to stockholders through dividends and using million in cash for acquisitions 
the expenditures for acquisitions were funded through a combination of borrowings and remaining cash flows from operating activities 
in  continuing operations generated million of cash flow  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to our decision to contribute million to our pension plans in  compared with million in the prior year 
excluding the pension contributions  cash flows from continuing operating activities increased by million 
the increase was attributable to improved profitability as well the receipt of a tax refund in fiscal of approximately million for the tax returns 
these positive cash flow components were offset by approximately  in increased net working capital from continuing operations 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  operating lease payments  pension contributions  mandatory debt payments and dividends 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of any remaining cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
capital structure in december  we entered into a new year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with nine participating banks 
the facility replaced an existing facility which was to expire in february proceeds under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
the agreement contains certain covenants including limitations on indebtedness and liens 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate  plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of june   the effective rate of interest for outstanding borrowings under the facility was 
we are required to pay an annual fee of on the maximum credit line 
as of june  and  we had borrowings of million and million  respectively under the revolving facilities 
available borrowings under the facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
at june   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the facility 
previously  debt outstanding under the prior facility had been classified a current obligation 
outstanding borrowings as of june  under the new facility have been classified as long term in the accompanying statement of financial position 
we also utilize money market credit facilities with two banks to help manage daily working capital needs 
the agreements  which expire annually  provide for a maximum aggregate credit line of million and are unsecured 
outstanding borrowings under the money market facilities reduce available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of june  and  we had  and  respectively  outstanding under these agreements 
at june  and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding for insurance purposes of million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of the net income of million less the dividends paid of million plus changes in the additional pension liability net of tax benefit of million and favorable foreign currency movements of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises in the current year 
short and long term net debt increased by million to million at june  the company s net debt to capital percentage improved to from in historically low interest rates  prior years of negative performance of the equity markets  and changes in actuarial assumptions caused us to suffer higher pension liabilities and lower pension assets in fiscal and these assumptions are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have included a million after tax charge in stockholders equity in fiscal to reflect the additional minimum liability under these plans 
the additional minimum liability is calculated based on the funded status of the plans at the end of the fiscal year 
the after tax equity charge and the change year to year does not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
pension expenses are expected to decrease by approximately  to million in as a result of the funded status of the pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions 
cash contribution requirements in are expected to be approximately million 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was million and million at june  and  respectively 
we sponsor a number of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans 
we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of these plans 
as noted above  the operating cash flows from continuing operations is expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing rules 
the company is contractually obligated under various operating leases for real property 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet items we had no material off balance sheet items at june  and at june   other than the operating lease and purchase obligations summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro and the british pound sterling pound 
during the current year  both these currencies have experienced increases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  and the pound has appreciated by relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters we are party to various claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to our business 
as explained more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality typically  the fourth quarter represent the best quarter for our consolidated financial results 
fourth quarter performance is generally enhanced by increased activity in the construction industry and activity in the food service equipment industry 
employee relations we maintain a solid working relationship with all of our unions and good employee relations are a focus of our management 
the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there were no work stoppages during fiscal year and a total of collective bargaining contracts covering employees will expire in fiscal although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet our financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill is not amortized  however  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  annually in the fourth quarter we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method and comparing that amount to the carrying value 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
the nature of the estimates made in projecting future cash flows could adversely affect the calculations made by us 
in addition  the estimate of fair value includes the use of a discount rate and a rate of future growth 
a basis point change in the discount rate used would not affect our analysis materially 
a basis po int change in the rate of future growth  independent of other variables  would not affect our analysis materially 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some post retirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or hig her bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a ten basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  per year 
a basis point decrease increase in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  we mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
we have one open foreign currency forward contract  the fair val ue exposure of which was immaterial 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro and the british pound sterling 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at june  would not result in a material increase in short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk is with the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  at june  and  we have no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the company also has million of long term debt and million of short term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with our long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
concentration of credit risk the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
in certain segments  some customers represent greater than of the segments revenues 
in the food service equipment group  five customers account for approximately of annual sales 
in our engineered products segment  one aerospace customer accounts for approximately of segment annual revenues and one energy customer accounts for approximately of annual sales 
in many of our businesses our national accounts regularly review their selection of vendors 
although our companies have historically prevailed and even gained market share under these circumstances  the outcome of future reviews can not be pre dicted 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
recently  prices for steel products have stabilized  but those levels are still above historical amounts paid 
however  we believe prices will continue to fluctuate  with trends indicating prices will rise again 
the adp  engineered products and food service equipment groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
during fiscal  we experienced price increases for a number of materials including copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
our affected divisions have generally implemented price increases intended on fully offsetting the increases in steel 
the implemented price increases in the food service equipment and engineered products group did not fully offset the higher materi al costs 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of material prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
