risk factors in this annual report 
overview and outlook general in  the company made significant progress toward achieving its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling billiards industries by introducing innovative and new technologies to build reliable and high quality products in all of the company s market segments  focusing on cost reduction initiatives through global sourcing and realignment of the company s manufacturing footprint  acquiring and investing in businesses that will expand and enhance the company s product offerings  particularly in boats and parts accessories  strengthening the company s relationships with its dealers by providing additional products and services that will make them more successful  improve the customer experience and  in turn  make brunswick more successful  and continuing to expand and enhance the company s global manufacturing footprint to achieve the best cost position 
while these activities are ongoing  the company continued to see positive overall results from its efforts reflected in its financial performance 
sales in increased percent to  million  primarily due to organic growth across the boat  marine engine and bowling billiards segments  and additional sales associated with acquisitions 
fitness segment sales decreased due to the divestiture of the omni retail stores in operating earnings for increased percent to million  primarily due to the sales gains  as well as effective cost management efforts and global sourcing initiatives 
these factors helped offset expenses associated with the acquisitions completed in and  the transition to low emission engines  which carry lower margins  in the company s marine engine segment and decreased absorption of fixed costs due to lower production levels that resulted from successful efforts to maintain healthy marine pipeline inventories 
the company also incurred additional costs for investments in research and development  new manufacturing plant start ups  marketing for the new product launches and international operations to support future growth 
see the results of operations section below for further discussion

looking ahead to  the company expects domestic retail demand for marine products to be flat with levels 
the company estimates that industry growth  coupled with market share gains  success of new products  improved pricing and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in  is expected to result in a low to mid single digit increase in marine sales in sales for bnt are expected to continue at a growth rate higher than the company s other businesses  primarily from increases in sales of the company s personal car navigation products 
fitness and bowling billiards segment sales are expected to increase in the mid single digits 
overall  sales are expected to increase to percent 
operating earnings are expected to improve in  benefiting from higher pricing across most market segments and slightly higher volumes  as well as the company s ongoing focus on effective cost management 
margin improvement in will be limited not only by slowing growth as compared to  but also by the continued transition to low emission outboard engines which carry lower margins 
the company will also incur higher material costs  especially for aluminum used in the production of boats and marine engines  expenses for stock options and higher variable compensation costs 
the company expects equity earnings to remain relatively flat compared with the company s effective tax rate in is expected to be approximately percent

the increase in net sales in was due to higher boat  marine engine and bowling billiards segment sales performance 
approximately percent of the increase in net sales was from organic growth  defined as net sales from the company s businesses that have operating results in comparable periods presented 
the remaining growth was due to acquisitions completed in and both the boat and marine engine segments benefited from an improved marine market  particularly in the first half of the year  and higher pricing in organic sales growth from the boat segment resulted from higher wholesale shipments to boat dealers domestically and internationally  most notably for the sea ray  boston whaler and hatteras brands  favorable pricing for us marine and sea ray and a positive mix shift to higher priced cruisers and sportyachts for sea ray 
marine engine segment net sales  which includes the company s mercury marine and brunswick new technologies bnt operations  increased primarily due to higher revenues from outboard engines and sterndrives as a result of growth in international markets  growth in mercury marine s parts and service business and higher sales of navigation products in international markets 
international sales increased million to  million in sales increased across all international regions with the largest impact coming from europe and the asia pacific region  which increased by million and million  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of personal car navigation products  boats and outboard engines 
the company s gross margin percentage decreased basis points in to percent from percent in this decrease was the result of the transition to low emission outboard engines in the second half of the year  which carry lower margins than the carbureted two stroke outboards they are replacing  lower fixed cost absorption and inefficiencies due to lower production rates during the second half of as a result of the company s effort to reduce marine customer inventory levels  especially for the company s aluminum boat businesses  and costs required to start up the company s manufacturing capacity in china to produce outboard engines and boats 
these factors were partially offset by favorable pricing in the boat and marine engine segment  a higher mix of bnt sales in  which generally carry a higher gross margin  and reduced warranty costs as a result of quality improvements 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points to percent of sales  down from percent of sales in during  sg a expenses increased million to million  primarily due to acquisitions  research  development and marketing investments in new products  and expenses related to the dispute with a chinese supplier as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements recorded in the company s bowling billiards segment 
these factors were largely offset by lower variable compensation expenses  million in reduced compensation expense from the company s ceo transition and the elimination of operating expenses due to the divestiture of the omni fitness retail stores in the fourth quarter of sg a expenses also benefited from a reduction in bad debt reserves due to improved international customer payment performance and the improved financial condition of certain domestic customers

this sale generated a pre tax gain of million for the company 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the sale of this investment 
the lower effective tax rate in was due primarily to refinements in the calculation of prior years extraterritorial income and the foreign sales corporation tax benefit  and reassessment of tax reserves for underlying exposures  offset by a reduction in tax reserves in additionally in  the company made a change in the assertion under apb no 
for previously undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the company determined that approximately million of undistributed net earnings from these foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the united states 
these earnings will provide the company with the opportunity to continue to expand its global manufacturing footprint  fund future growth in foreign locations and shift the company s acquisition focus to europe and asia 
the company s current intentions meet the indefinite investment criteria of apb no 
additionally  the company s tax rate benefited from utilization of previously unrecognized loss carryforwards applied in connection with the marinemax investment sale gain discussed above 
the effective tax rate was further favorably impacted by higher foreign earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details excluding the tax benefits of these items  the company s effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in  which also excludes the tax reserve reduction described in the following vs 
section 
management believes that presentation of the effective tax rate  excluding the investment sale gain and other non recurring tax benefits in both years  provides a more meaningful comparison because the investment sale gain and non recurring tax benefits are unique to their respective periods  and  accordingly  there are no comparable items in either or net earnings and diluted earnings per share increased  primarily due to the same factors discussed above in operating earnings  the gain on sale of the company s investment in marinemax and the lower effective tax rate 
excluding this gain  the tax reserve reduction and other non recurring tax benefits  diluted earnings per share would have been per diluted share in compared with per diluted share in  which excludes the tax reserve reduction described in the following vs

sales increased percent as the company reported sales gains across all reportable segments 
approximately percent of the increase in sales was from organic growth  defined as sales from the company s businesses that have operating results in comparable periods presented 
both the marine engine and boat segments benefited from an improved marine market 
organic sales growth for the marine engine segment was largely due to higher wholesale shipments of outboard and sterndrive engines in domestic markets  as well as higher sales of gps based products at navman and higher wholesale shipments of outboard engines in international markets 
organic sales growth for the boat segment was due to higher shipments across most boat brands in both domestic and international markets due to the success of new products  increased customer demand and favorable pricing 
organic sales growth for the fitness segment was the result of higher domestic and international commercial sales related to the success of new models 
organic sales growth for the bowling billiards segment was due to higher sales volume of bowling capital equipment and consumer products  as well as higher bowling center revenues and increased sales of billiard tables and equipment 
international sales increased million to  million in compared with  million in sales increased across all international regions  with the largest impact coming from europe  the pacific rim and canada  which increased by million  million and million  respectively 
this increase is due to an increase in boat and outboard engine sales  the benefit of a weaker us dollar and additional revenues associated with acquisitions 
gross margin percentage increased in compared with primarily due to the favorable impact associated with and acquisitions  favorable pricing in the boat and marine engine segments  increased sales of higher horsepower  higher margin engines  operational efficiencies due to higher production levels  the benefit of a weaker dollar and successful cost reduction initiatives 
these factors were partially offset by higher compensation costs  a mix shift in outboard engines to lower margin  low emission engines  and a mix shift to lower margin strength equipment and higher materials costs in the fitness segment 
in addition  lower pension costs were mostly offset by higher healthcare and insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased basis points in primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
sg a expenses increased by million to million in from million in this increase is attributable to the acquisitions completed in and  which accounted for approximately percent of the increase  higher compensation costs and promotional expenses for new product launches 
operating earnings increased to million in from million in  excluding the previously mentioned litigation charge 
management believes that presentation of operating earnings in  excluding this litigation charge  provides a more meaningful comparison to current period results  because there was no comparable litigation charge in operating earnings 
the increase in operating earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes in all reportable segments and the factors affecting gross margin percentage as described above 
these factors were partially offset by the increase in sg a expenses as discussed above  higher research and development expenses across most segments driven by acquisitions completed in and  and competitive pricing pressures in the asia pacific region in the marine engine segment 
operating earnings were also unfavorably affected by approximately million in compared with  primarily attributable to the marketing and production start up of the new verado family of four stroke outboard engines  start up and other expenses associated with the construction of an outboard engine assembly plant in china  and expenses to develop a new boat design process to better integrate engine and marine electronics into original boat designs 
interest expense increased by million to million in compared with million in  primarily due to the issuance of new debt described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements

the company s effective tax rate was reduced to percent in from percent in the lower effective tax rate for the year was primarily due to a tax reserve reassessment of million arising from the completion of federal tax audit examinations of years to  and higher foreign and state earnings in lower effective tax rate jurisdictions 
excluding the million reassessment in tax reserves  the company s effective tax rate for was percent 
management believes that the presentation of the effective tax rate in  excluding this tax reserve reassessment  provides a more meaningful comparison to  because there was no comparable tax reserve reassessment in average common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share increased to million in from million in the increase in average diluted outstanding shares was due to the exercise of stock options and an increase in common stock equivalents due to an increase in the company s average stock price during the period

net sales for bnt of million increased percent from million in as a result of higher demand for navigation products in international markets 
the increase in operating earnings of mercury marine was primarily due to the increase in sales  cost containment actions  reduced warranty costs as a result of quality improvements  a reduction in bad debt reserves due to improved international customer payment performance and the improved financial condition of certain domestic customers and lower variable compensation costs 
these factors were partially offset by strategic investments for increased marketing and promotional activities for the four cylinder supercharged verado engines and start up costs associated with both the new outboard engine manufacturing facility in china  as well as expenses for a new four stroke production line 
in the second half of  mercury marine operating earnings were also negatively impacted by the transition to lower margin low emission outboard engines and lower fixed cost absorption as a result of reduced production levels to maintain balanced pipeline inventories 
higher operating earnings for bnt were primarily due to the increase in sales  especially from global positioning systems based products  which was largely offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses to support the business growth and an increase in bnt s investment in research and development

environmental regulation in its marine engine segment  the company will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements

the state of california has adopted regulations requiring catalytic converters on the company s sterndrive and inboard engines by january  the company expects to comply fully with these regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products 
other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries also may impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for the company s engines  which would require the company to modify these engines  increasing their cost 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats  marine engines  global positioning systems based products  marine electronics  fitness equipment  bowling products and billiard tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability and revenue is adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivables for the company s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific claims are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
environmental 
the company accrues for environmental remediation related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated 
all accrued amounts are generally determined in coordination with third party experts on an undiscounted basis and do not consider recoveries from third parties until such recoveries are realized 
in light of existing reserves  the company s environmental claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserves 
the company records a liability for self insurance obligations  which include employee related health care benefits and claims for workers compensation  product liability  general liability and auto liability 
the liability is estimated based on claims incurred as of the date of the financial statements 
in estimating the obligations associated with self insurance reserves  the company primarily uses loss development factors based on historical claim experience  which incorporate anticipated exposure for losses incurred  but not yet reported 
these loss development factors are used to estimate ultimate losses on incurred claims 
actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves 
pension  postretirement and postemployment costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit reserves are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  respectively 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company historically provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates 
as of july   the company determined that certain foreign subsidiaries undistributed net earnings were to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the united states 
the company estimates its tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s application of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the tax rate for the company to increase or decrease

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditioned on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
hedging of an asset or liability is accomplished through the use of financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss recognized on the asset or liability 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect that changes in interest rates have on the fair market value of the company s debt and to lower the company s borrowing costs on current or anticipated issuances of debt 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk is primarily attributable to fixed rate debt instruments 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements and futures contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the company uses a value at risk var computation to estimate the maximum one day reduction in pre tax earnings related to its foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the var computation includes the company s debt  foreign currency hedge contracts  interest rate swap agreements  commodity swap agreements and futures contracts 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company could incur on its derivative financial instruments from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates or commodity prices using the var estimation model 
the var model uses the monte carlo simulation statistical modeling technique and uses historical foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates and prices in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and includes substantially all market risk exposures 
the estimated potential losses shown in the table below  for a time period of one day and confidence level of percent  have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in millions risk category foreign exchange interest rates commodity prices the percent confidence level signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices could move in the company s favor 
the var model assumes that all movements in rates and commodity prices will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  as actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in global financial markets
