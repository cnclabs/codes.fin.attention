overview as used herein  the terms we  us  our or the company refer to biomed realty trust  inc  a maryland corporation  and any of our subsidiaries  including biomed realty  lp  a maryland limited partnership our operating partnership  and industrial road  lp industrial road or our predecessor 
we operate as a fully integrated  self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit focused on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
our tenants primarily include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  scientific research institutions  government agencies and other entities involved in the life science industry 
our properties and primary acquisition targets are generally located in markets with well established reputations as centers for scientific research  including boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey 
we were formed on april  and commenced operations on august   after completing our initial public offering 
our initial public offering consisted of the sale of  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
on august   in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  we issued an additional  shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate proceeds to us  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  were approximately million 
we issued a stock warrant in connection with our initial public offering to raymond james associates  inc  the lead underwriter  for the right to purchase  common shares at per share  which equals the estimated fair value at the date of grant 
the warrant became exercisable six months after our initial public offering and expires on august  from inception through august   neither the company nor our operating partnership had any operations 
simultaneously with our initial public offering  we obtained a million revolving unsecured credit facility  which we used to finance acquisitions and for other corporate purposes prior to being replaced on may  with a million revolving unsecured credit facility with keybank national association and other lenders 
on january   we leased  rentable square feet in phase two of our industrial road property  located south of san francisco  to nuvelo  inc under a seven year  triple net lease 
nektar therapeutics  an existing tenant at the property  had leased approximately  square feet of this space until august  which it had never occupied 
we agreed to terminate nektar s lease of its phase two space in exchange for termination payments 
nektar continues to lease approximately  square feet of space in phase one of the property  which lease expires in october on april   we entered into a lease amendment with centocor  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
under the amendment  centocor agreed to lease an additional  rentable square feet at our king of prussia property located in radnor  pennsylvania through march  the new lease replaced the existing portion of the master lease with an affiliate of the rubenstein company  the original seller of the property  with respect to this space 
annualized base rent of million and certain tenant reimbursements received under the new lease have correspondingly reduced the rent received under the master lease 
on may   we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of eight properties including one parking structure in cambridge  massachusetts  and an additional property in lebanon  new hampshire  from the lyme timber company  an affiliate of lyme properties 
we refer to these properties as the cambridge portfolio 
the cambridge portfolio consists of ten buildings with an aggregate of approximately million 
table of contents rentable square feet of laboratory and office space  which upon acquisition was leased with an average remaining term of ten years  and includes the parking structure with parking spaces 
the purchase price was million  excluding closing costs  and was funded through borrowings under three credit facilities with keybank national association and other lenders  described below  and the assumption of approximately million of mortgage indebtedness 
in addition to the acquisition of the cambridge portfolio  during  we acquired properties containing approximately  rentable square feet of laboratory and office space that was leased at acquisition 
on june   we completed a follow on common stock offering of  shares at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility  to repay our million unsecured term loan  to acquire properties and for other corporate purposes 
on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective on december  the universal shelf registration statement may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities 
from our initial public offering through december   we have declared aggregate dividends on our common stock and distributions on our operating partnership units of per common share and unit  representing five full quarterly dividends of and a partial third quarter dividend of per common share and unit 
as of december   we owned or had interests in properties  located principally in boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  maryland  pennsylvania and new york new jersey  consisting of buildings with approximately million rentable square feet of laboratory and office space  which was approximately leased to tenants 
of the approximately  square feet of unleased space   square feet  or of our unleased square footage  was under redevelopment 
we also owned undeveloped land that we estimate can support up to  rentable square feet of laboratory and office space 
industrial road was the largest of the properties contributed in our initial public offering and therefore has been identified as the accounting acquirer pursuant to paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
as such  the historical financial statements presented herein for industrial road were prepared on a stand alone basis up to and including the acquisition date  august  upon completion of our initial public offering  the interest in the predecessor acquired from affiliates was recorded at historic cost 
the acquisitions of the unaffiliated interests in the predecessor and the interests in all of the other properties have been accounted for as a purchase in accordance with sfas factors which may influence future operations our corporate strategy is to continue to focus on acquiring  developing  owning  leasing and managing laboratory and office space for the life science industry 
as of december   our property portfolio was leased to tenants 
approximately of our leased square footage expires during and approximately of our leased square footage expires during our leasing strategy for focuses on leasing currently vacant space and negotiating renewals for leases scheduled to expire during the year  and identifying new tenants or existing tenants seeking additional space to occupy the spaces for which we are unable to negotiate such renewals 
additionally  we will seek to lease space that is currently under a master lease arrangement at our king of prussia property  which expires in the master lease at our bayshore boulevard property expired in february we also intend to proceed with new developments  when prudent 
the success of our leasing and development strategy will be dependent upon the general economic conditions in the united states and in our target markets of boston  san diego  san francisco  seattle  
table of contents maryland  pennsylvania  new york new jersey and research parks near or adjacent to universities 
we are optimistic that market conditions will continue to improve during as evidenced by reduced vacancy rates for life science space in however  this is contingent upon continued strong job growth in our markets 
we believe that  on a portfolio basis  rental rates on leases expiring in and are at or below market rental rates that are currently being achieved in our markets 
however  we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be released at rental rates equal to or above the current contractual rental rates or at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they address the most material parts of our financial statements  require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify  and continue to qualify  as a reit 
however  it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax and  in most of the states  state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes 
if we lose our reit status  then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved  and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
investments in real estate investments in real estate are carried at depreciated cost 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements to years ground lease term of the related lease tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years acquired in place leases non cancelable term of the related lease acquired management agreements non cancelable term of the related agreement purchase accounting was applied  on a pro rata basis where appropriate  to the assets and liabilities of real estate entities in which we acquired an interest or a partial interest 
the fair value of tangible assets of an 
table of contents acquired property which includes land  buildings  and improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
we determine the as if vacant fair value using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
in allocating fair value to the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place leases are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and b our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases at acquisition  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease  any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of acquired in place leases and acquired management agreements  are recorded based on a variety of components including  but not necessarily limited to a the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases ie the market cost to execute a lease  including leasing commissions and legal fees  if any  b the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period ie real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  c the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period  and d the value associated with avoided tenant improvement costs or other inducements to secure a tenant lease 
the fair value assigned to the acquired management agreements are recorded at the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the management agreements acquired of the acquired management agreements with certain tenants of the acquired properties 
the values of in place leases and management agreements are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable period of the respective leases or agreements 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts related to that lease would be written off 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development  construction  improvements and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
capitalized costs associated with unsuccessful acquisitions are charged to expense when an acquisition is abandoned 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized 
repairs and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset or increase its operating efficiency 
significant replacement and betterments represent costs that extend an asset s useful life or increase its operating efficiency 

table of contents we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
revenue recognition all leases are classified as operating leases and minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in accrued straight line rents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and contractually due but unpaid rents are included in accounts receivable 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
the reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with eitf   reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf requires that these reimbursements be recorded gross  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and bear the credit risk 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled  collectibility is assured  and we have no continuing obligation to provide space to the former tenants 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent and tenant recovery payments or defaults 
we also maintain an allowance for accrued straight line rents and amounts due from lease terminations 
payments received under master lease agreements entered into with the sellers of the bayshore and king of prussia properties to lease space that was not producing rent at the time of the acquisition are recorded as a reduction to buildings and improvements rather than as rental income in accordance with eitf  recognition of receipts from made up rental shortfalls 
investments in partnerships we evaluate our investments in limited liability companies and partnerships under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements arb 
fin provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or vies and the determination of which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
generally  fin applies when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
eitf states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
if the criteria in eitf are met  the consolidation of existing limited liability companies and partnerships accounted for under the equity method may be required 
our adoption of eitf is expected to have no effect on net income or stockholders equity 
eitf is effective june  for new or modified limited partnership arrangements and effective january  for existing limited partnership arrangements
